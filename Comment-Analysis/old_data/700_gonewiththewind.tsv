20	Luis Martins	Que linda era Vivien!❤️
21	Dog Lover	A good movie for anyone who needs to learn that a life of privilege does not always mean that you get what you want all the time and that privileged people also suffer.
22	Lucinda Moran	Best video short I have ever ❤ seen! With the original beautiful music ! Thank you! Thank you! Tank you!

27	dana carter	They said ever person in the world would have to see the movie for David to get his money back ,we are still watching almost a 100 years later , best picture ever ❤
28	Godai Yoko	Unforgetable
29	PAULO BOCCATO	Epic !!! Today? The movies are so trash ...
30	Antonio Manso	I played such theme at so many parties entrance themes. Pastor JBAlmeida Brazil.
31	Christine Mulligan	Magnificent!
32	Christine Mulligan	I loved this song in the early fifties when it was the theme song of Million Dollar Movie and even more when I discovered Gone With the Wind. Later on, I named my beautiful daughter Tara...such a hauntingly beautiful melody...
33	Stuart Joy	Vivien Leigh is one of the most stunning and beautiful women that has walked this planet ❤.
34	Elisanderson	Ohhh, professor Girafales...
35	Churchill	「I’ve always had a weakness for lost causes, once they’re really lost.」 That is my most favorite line out of this movie.
36	Chiến	this piece hit different after reading it
37	Ashley	Wonderful! My mother's favourite film; where she found my name! 😊😊
38	wicked child	Não gostaria de entrar para tomar uma xícara de café?
39	Kiran Sampat	Rhett is right to leave Scarlett.He has tried to win Scarletts Affection and Scarlett ran to Ashley all the time.
40	Darla Z	Nothing like it in the world! Beautiful, magical!
41	Phil Hurtado	Back in the fifties, I saw the movie, and at that time channel 8 in San Diego had the daily news, with Tara’s theme as their back ground music. That’s when this music, Tara’s theme, became part of my history. I used to tear-up when ever it played, as it reminded me of how a way of life disappeared from history resulting from the civil war, hence the name of the movie…”Gone with the wind”!
42	gehtdich garnixan	Die Kleider- traumhaft
43	Soller Games	- Teacher Girafales! - Miss Florinda! - What a miracle you are here! - I came to bring you this humble little gift.. - Thank you very much! Don't want to come in for a coffee? - Wouldn't it be too much trouble? - Of course not, come in, please. - After you, miss.
44	Deathrow Inmate	I wondered why it was called Gone With The Wind ..... then the scene where all they had to eat was radishes. I understand why.
45	Joédson Gomes	This song is the theme of the characters: Dona Florinda and Girafales teacher, from the series, El Chavo del ocho, by the eternal Mexican playwright Roberto Goméz Bolanos.
46	Claudia Ferguson	I've always loved this song. And to find out the same composer wrote the Casablanca theme amazes me.
47	Kevin Jones	One of the True Classics. Majestic. The best part was Scarletts Indomitable Will, and her Strength and Perseverance in Rebuilding after the Civil War. Must've been her Irish blood. Great job by Margaret Mitchell on the novel.
48	MG Expressions	🥕
49	Katrín Sigurþórsdóttir	Best movie ever. Classic , elegant lovely and sad. Beautiful love story but also so sad 😔❤❤❤❤🇮🇸
50	Mat	Professor Girafales... Dona Florinda...

53	Vangrun	❤️❤️❤️ so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
54	Elizabeth Mendes	😍😘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
55	Margarida Truth	Every Christmas, in my childhood we sat to watch this moovie. Many years in a row. My eyes cry missing those free, simple and happy days. Miss my familly members that are not in this realm anymore. Merry Christmas every one out there. Love from Portugal 🇵🇹💖🎅
56	Renato	-Professor Girafales -Dona Florinda
57	Sam	This movie has a grandeur all its own. The score is unforgettable. Who has not found himself humming it, as he goes about his day? The casting is sheer perfection, although I wish Olivia de Havilland were not quite such a milksop. I think I actually like Leslie Howard best, despite being permanently in love with Vivian Leigh. As for Clark Gable, he ceased being Clark Gable after this film was made. He's Rhett Butler, now and forever.
58	Ivan Lussich	I am an Uruguayan senior citizen. I saw this movie 3 times: in my teens, in my forties and in senior age. First two times it did not quite impress me, but last time I was thrilled to see Gable, Leigh and Howard's performances. And the picture overall is fantastic.
59	amour yvette	Great movie, great actors, great music and perhaps a lesson for mankind. Going through with your life’s even there are though things crossing your pad. Hope, trust , believe and love : I think that’s the message of the movie. And never lost faith 😢👼🏻🦋🕊🤍🌹
60	john francis	The music is so evocative bringing the whole sweep of the movie to the listener.
61	Davi Vogel Zimmer	-Professor Girafales? -Dona Florinda!
62	Sandra12	My mother adored this movien and even more Vivien Leigh. She thaught me to love this film as well. And just this day I realized that they had the same birthday, november the 5th🎉 I wish my mother knew. She passed away 2018. But this movie and music reminds me so much of her. 💖
63	Evelyn Hofmann	Greatest Movie ever...watch it every Chance I can...still cry at the ending Because I wanted them Scarlett and Rehett to be together...Fell in love With Mr. Gable at the age of 10 yrs. My daughter is named Tara in honor Of this classic...NEVER NEVER will Tire of this classic....thank you for This video of clips....
64	Lucas Almeida Peixoto	This song is very similar to the wedding song of Professor Girafales and Dona Florinda. In the series Chaves.
65	jona edvards	Best movie ever made ❤️❤️❤️
66	Abandon All Hope.	I think Gerald O’Hara was the wisest man in the series. He was right about everything in the end. Tara is and was the only thing Scarlett ever has and will have after all is said and done.
67	karen hall	I'm sitting at work listening to this and it's such a relaxing piece of music.
68	David Cardone	Frankly my Dear I don't give a Damn!
69	parakeet8157	Epic moments went into the making of an epic classic.
70	Dark Paradise	"Before watching this movie I couldn't answer ""What's your favorite movie?"" . But after watching Gone With The Wind I can say that without any hesitation..."
71	Joe Echo	"I believe this is where Ennio Marricone had his inspiration for ""Once Upon A Time in the West."" But, frankly, my dear? I don't give a damn."
72	Brett Duffy	The Old South seemed like such a romantic time love to live back then but I wouldn't hate it not having air conditioning
73	Your awesome	There is something magical about this film
74	Malcolm Harris	Unquestionably the greatest music score in film history.
75	Bruce1956	One of the great movies. 1939 was a great year for movies.
76	LowRanger	Tara's Theme gives me goose bumps over my entire body. What an inspired composition.
77	坂井潤	世紀の大悲恋物語。

84	Bebe Brez-Kal	Stop destroying our country with your racist bs...there are much worse things happening in this world like ABORTION😪 ...which the left is for...go figure😏....TALK ABOUT SINS 😒
85	Pina Colada	"The best quote I can think of to summarize the movie is this: ""That which Fortune has not given, she cannot take away"" by Seneca, a Stoic philosopher"
86	Jerry Santos	nice theme and actress

102	gonzaemon h	Best of Tara's Theme in Youtube
103	Darryl Seamans	I never saw this movie, but the theme is iconic. Beautiful
104	hollieollo	One of the very few films where the score actually mimics the great scenes in the film. This film brought home the utter futility of the American Civil war and the endless sadness that war brought, the ramifications of which we still see today. Whoever did the casting, I hope they got an oscar.

136	Captain Deadeye	RIP Olivia Dehavilland.
137	Young Raines	Another classic - Vivien Leigh & Clarke Gable - they no longer produce such epic movies. The story line is embedded in historical times during the turbulent Civil War era - a very sad part of our history indeed. Vivien Leigh is breathtakingly beautiful. Clarke Gable is such a charming gentleman.
138	sonicgoon Pics	Trump was right bring back ‘Gone with the wind’
139	dick hunter	Greatest grossing movie of all time, and those liberal, leftwing socialist blmers want to ban it. Took my first wife to see it on our first date and we became engaged right then. Forty-seven glorious years with her before the Lord took her home.

164	Olivia Harlfinger	The best movie of all time and now it’s being taken away from us. Frankly my dear people, I DO give a dam!
165	John Ossmann	For those of us who grew up in the 1960s and 70s, in the New York/New Jersey area, Channel 9, WOR-TV used this song just before the start of the Million Dollar Movie. Always a great memory of those times.
166	楊吉蒂	My most favorate movies all times
167	Eileen Pollock	This was beautifully done, and the music was for once, appropriate. Every key scene brought back memories of the whole. GWTW is a classic and I hope it will always be shown. I was 9 years old when it first came to the movies in a rerun. I could hardly wait, as I'd read the book in second grade. It kept being rerun over a period of years.
168	Johnny Gainor	I love this, beautifully done ~
169	Michael Hanley	":::Whistle: :: ""Has the War Started?"""
170	R T	Frankly, my dear, there will always be a Gone With The Wind no matter what.
171	Ashley Hallows	I can't believe the Government have now banned Gone with the Wind the world's gone mad and I've had enough !
172	Michael Behan	I have watched this magnificent movie (in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made) more than 15 times and I never get sick of it! As for HBO and the woke wankers who make up the company all I can say is it don’t give a damn’ about your contrived indignation! You are just cowards who buckle at the first sign that some little pissant may get their feelings hurt! Grow some balls and stand up for the 99% of people who see this as a MOVIE! Pathetic losers. I hope you go broke!
173	Shambhala Libertalia Iram	My family kept watching this movie back home years ago via VCD, and today, my brother and I rewatched it again via HBO Max. It is indeed a timeless movie! One of my favorite of all time, along with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, GBU, Once Upon a Time Trilogy, Stanley Kubrick Films, Waterfront, Wonderful Life, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, Casablanca etc.
174	Mark Warner	So am I a racist if I want to watch this film then
175	susan m	A Masterpiece!!! This song is a masterpiece that brought up morals, pride and loyalty, death, repentance courage and forgiveness through the movie Gone With the Wind, A true work of art! No should try retro fit this movie to reflect the year 2020.

213	Pankaj Shah	Argubly one of the finest n greatest movie if all time, though released in 1939 stll looks fresh as if today.Written by Margaret Mitchell,directed by Victor Fleming n xllant n touchy composition of great Max Steiner.Perhaps the debut movie of Vivian Leigh.Clark Gable n Olivia De Havilland are superb.Must watch as all in one.💐💐💐

231	Antonio Pinto	Um dos temas mais bonitos do cinema, num dos filmes mais espetaculares de sempre. Elenco formidável.
232	Michael Behan	My grandmother, who died about 20 years ago, first saw this when it was released in 1939. Her and I both watched it on DVD with sound blaring through the surround sound system. It was like she had been transported back to her first viewing. Since then I have worn out two copies of the DVD and have the sealed anniversary edition (with another for me to watch)! One of the greatest movies ever made!
233	97kos	Love this theme so much! Maybe, when I will have more time, I will see from beginning till the end this movie 💕 With beginning, 2:35 to 3:04 is the best part!

I went to see it with my cousin. I was about 11 and she was about 15 and we enjoyed the movie very much.

(Known as ""The Million Dollar Movie"") Best theme ... and I remember when Channel 9 in the NYC area had a weekly movie series called ""The Million Dollar Movie"" ... every Sunday and it played that theme song. And look what I just found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPTQRmwCOWs ... the theme is etched in my soul. Beautiful and my folks loved that movie so much it brings back loving memories of them. From the era when they knew how to produce a REAL MOVIE!"

272	Jackie Mcmeekin	One of the greatest movies ever made. It won eleven Academy Awards! The acting is superb. And the book and movie gives one a vivid picture of the Civil War. We lost more of our men in that war than any, I believe. Thank you for the download of this beautiful song and the great scenes from the movie. I watch it often! 👍💕
273	Steve Eckstein	"OUR DEAREST DARLING GIRL, TARYN(NAMED AFTER ""TARA"") WAS ""GONE WITH THE WIND, UP TO BOSTON, THEN D.C., THEN N.Y.C. & HAS TRAVELED THE WORLD(FROM ""MACHU PISZU"" TO SOUTH AFRICA TO MADRID, TO IRELAND, LONDON & VENICE & ROME, & MORE TO COME> FACT: CHANNEL 9(WOR T.V.0 IN NEW YORK USED THIS AS IT'S THEME SONG FOR SO MANY YEARS, WHEN SIGNING OFF IN THE EARLY MORN'S."
274	Bill Fortune	Its beauty is timeless and for the ages. If you could have live the era of 40-50-60 and 70's like I have, America would be a wonder of a land to live. We have lost so much, we really have.

283	Jayne Haught	Oh my God love..love..love..

307	FER NANDO	My father favorite film
308	Carolyn Nuss	Best motion picture of all time. Loved the music score to this movie as well. Both Clark Gable & Vivien Leigh were superb in their roles. Vivien Leigh WAS Scarlett O'Hara, meaning that she was born to play that role. It was tailor made for her. Nobody else could've done the role justice the way that she did.
309	Richard Kirschenbaum	For all you GWTW fans (of which I am certainly one) Do not miss the Northrn GWTW made in 1957 called Raintree County with Monty Clift and Liz Taylor in the obvious mirror image roles. Also stars Eva Maria Saint and Lee Marvin.

352	Sender Yancey	Gone ...but not forgotten. Southerners will always be in the middle of the Civil War and the glorious, proud SOUTH !!
353	Sally Ackerley	Brindessi
354	Kimberly Klaus	Melanie-the best friend that everyone should have. I loved her character and hated that she had to die. And, if Scarlett had been born just 100 years later, she'd be CEO of a major corporation and girls everywhere would look up to her for her business sense and how she succeeded in a man's world. Maybe not for her tendency to steal other girls' fiancées, but her other qualities. And how she realized too late what real love is. Ah well, tomorrow IS another day!
355	Midi Morin	God...Vivien Leigh was definitely one of the most beautiful actresses of all time.

398	Cris Pizza	O filme eterno . Perfeito .
399	Dominica Wynne	The greatest film ever, and most of the emotional scenes were left to the audience's imagination. Now it's meet, jump into bed, baby arrives, and daddy takes off. What a contrast then between then and now. Give me then anytime.
400	Paul Mollard	Proof of how certain pieces of music can give you a 'lump in the throat'!

421	funnyguy52	The greatest of all film themes and scores. This version is not the one heard in the film. Don't know which orchestra or year this one is. It doesn't quite have the energy and warmth of the film version and the finale is a let-down, just doesn't quite work.
422	Becca Brayton	Does this remind anyone of the Great Movie Ride???
423	priebea	Never forget this movie!
424	DCBARNONE89	Hi. I love your video, thanks for sharing! This is a great film and music as well! The score is classic Hollywood mixed with the old south. Good times to thee! EML Arlington, Va.
425	Donald Bryan	Order your copy today before the Fascists ban it!!
426	Kim Dossett	Frankly, HOLLYWOOD, we don't give a DAMN!!!!!! You've made untold millions upon millions of dollars off of this movie with rereleases, videos and CD's since the original was released in 1939. Gable never got a fricken dime from the role. That's right people, not a dime. Gable was contracted to another studio at the time and they took his pay and royalty rights. Of course they are greedy bums too. Seventy fricken six years should be enough profits. Drop the copy right. Let the world enjoy this classic piece of history. You whiny,greedy bums.
427	Kim Dossett	Remember picnics under the tree that Scarlett swore to never go hungry again when I was a small boy. In Georgia. As an adult used to picnic by the water wheel and mill located in little rock arkansas. First movie filmed in color. First cuss word in a movie. A timeless classic.

459	Blessings And Peace	beautiful music
460	funnyguy52	The greatest movie theme of all time! This version is actually the full opening theme (minus 'Dixie') and the music heard at the end of Act One. Watch the opening of the film to hear the definitive version of this music masterpiece.

474	ronetteloverz	Also used as the Million Dollar Movie theme on channel 9 in New York City in the late 50's & early 60's..... when a million dollars was a big buck movie production.
475	nathan stewart	What is up with Hollywood? Are they not capable of make something so magical anymore? It's sad.
476	wearybutwilling	does anyone know who wrote the score for GWTW? Usually their are some great people who know the answers and tell me. This movie is a classic and a great one but not my favorite. It's on my top 3 list, but not #1. LOVE it THOUGH! I will watch it again even though I have seen it 11 times. This is a true classic of all time!

485	DEthe5150	"Happy 100th Birthday, Vivien Leigh, you were an outstanding actress & you will always be remembered. ""Tara! Home. I'll go home, and I'll think of some way to get him back! After all, tomorrow is another day!"""
486	Abend音楽を夕暮れと共に	幼い日に映画を見て以来、スカーレットという美貌の女性と男性的なレッドバトラーその他の人間と時代背景に胸がときめきました。
487	Paul Herring	With respect, it was the American Civil War in Gone With The Wind, not the War of Independence. It's called the Revolutionary War in the USA. Even so, American actors have often portrayed other nationalities in films. It showcases the talents of all actors if they can do that and pull it off, don't you think?
488	Fina Lopez	Complicado amor ...
489	Awadea	"Oh my Goooood. I love the music, the film and the book. I saw this film when I was ten. I watched it with my mother in the late night. It was great. I love Vivian Leigh but I also like the filmseries called ""Scarlett"" with Joanne Walley-Kilmer. She plays Scarlett outstanding too. And the book Scarlett is awesome, too. I read the 1000 Sites in two days. I'm nuts I know :D"
490	labechina figue	this picture a have seen 12 times,is marvelous,and i like very much clark geable,was a very great actor,in this film was great also vivian lee,this is a magistral film
491	Tatsu1-4-4	Picture the scene: you're a director of a movie based on the American War of Independence. Now also picture that most of the main actors are British...stupid isn't it? Considering the subject matter, American actors should be used and should have been used in Gone With The Wind.
492	William Brick	Sadly no! The actress who played Bonnie was an actress named Cammie King who passed away in 2010 at the age of 76 from lung cancer.
493	Guiseppe Heat	I LOVE this movie and the book sooooooo much!
494	FyllingenOy	Dixie, the unofficial anthem of the south and the most popular song in the confederacy, was written by a northerner. It doesn't matter who wrote it, the only thing that matters is what the song is about. The same thing goes for the nationality of the actors.
495	TXRider	I was so sad when Bonnie (the character) died. :(
496	TXRider	Pardon?
497	niculae cristea	Tomorow it's another day!
498	niculae cristea	Merveilleux! Merci beaucoup, Eternal!
499	Harry Lube	That means hi in spanish!
500	SZealot	But since when was Clark Gable British? He's all American. Olivia was a British-American (duel nationality/citizenship). Get your facts right please and why are being like that? Most comments are peaceful.
501	Tatsu1-4-4	Yeah and the main actors who are all British too. Strange that really. Clark Gable, Vivian Leigh, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard all playing the lead role for what is known as the most American of movies. Now that's funny.
502	Hendrick Wijaya Setiawan	Dream of peace....
503	Emily Rose	Beautiful :(
504	HM The Tsar of Russia	Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!
505	Daniel Kalban	Fine with me XD
506	Nolan Key	Can we just stop arguing and enjoy the music? I'm sorry if you got angry at me. But we all have views about how the Civil War started. Can't we just get along and listen to this beautiful movie score?
507	Daniel Kalban	Oh that's a bunch of BS. And two wrongs doesn't make a right. The South bullied their way for years, and they should be kept in their place still because they obviously still don't know how to act like civilized human beings.
508	Nolan Key	Did the Historians mention that the congressman was making fun of the South? I know they had their society built on Slaves. But how does that make it so they provoked the war? The North wasn't bullied by the South, The North practically ran the South and posted the unfair Tariffs in 1832 and 1828. South Carolina attempted to secede but the North scared them into coming back, So if anybody was the bully it was the North.
509	Daniel Kalban	Im sorry, but the South instigated this according to most historians. And one Southern Congressman literally BEAT a Northern one in the Capitol itself! The South brought it on itself. Besides, they hoisted themselves by their own petard by being an agrarian society built on the back of slaves. The South bullied the North, we fought back, and the South, like all bullies, ran away like a little bitch and karma was visited upon it.
510	Nolan Key	If they were getting their way the tariff wouldn't have even been released on the south and Abe Lincoln would have never gotten to be President. The North was basically bullying the South for a while and until the conflict of slavery was spoken of was when the North and the South started fighting.
511	Daniel Kalban	Sorry, but I'm speaking the truth. The South instigated it by literally firing the first shot after being spoiled brats getting their way for nearly 100 years and they reaped what they sowed: Utter Humiliation and Deserved Vilification
512	Nolan Key	I'm not a southerner and if you would study the facts I told you, You would find what I said to be correct.
513	Daniel Kalban	Sorry, but GOOD historians say otherwise. You lost. We won. Get over it.
514	Nolan Key	Sorry I was running out of characters. But with all the facts I had given you I proved that you can't truly have called the south the aggressors.
515	tessithegreat	epic book......epic movie.....
516	Daniel Kalban	"""Northern Aggression""? You were the guys who pitched a fit about losing an election, left the union, and fired the first shots! You were the aggressors!"
517	Nolan Key	This is my favorite movie score
518	ziggyboi1995	It was once a sovereign and independent nation, but we lost the War of Northern Aggression, so we had to rejoin the US, which is going to Hell in a handbasket if we don't get the National Debt under control.
519	kristi g	what do you mean 'rise again'? how has it fallen?
520	Marina Abreu	1:28 Dona Florinda Professor Girafales Não que entrar para tomar uma xícara de café? Não seria muito incomodo? Mas é claro que não!
521	Jonas Junior	Wow, BRAVO! I totally agree with you. How can we get those old times back?
522	nicolas villegas	frankly my dear, i dont give a damn
523	aditistarr	Tears come to my eyes instantly when this is played
524	FyllingenOy	What about Dixie?
525	xxIluvyouguysxx	Actually, the song was composed by Max Steiner, who was from Austria.
526	teemo	She sadly died a few weeks ago ;(
527	2Dawgz	I wonder if that baby that played Bonnie is still around. She/he's be about 75.
528	Daddy- Agario	"In Italy this song has been used as the opening music for a political TV show called ""Porta a porta"" which is aired on rai 1"
529	Leandro Carlos	enfim alguem q reconheceu a musica kk
530	Maximilian Cady	— Professor Girafales! — Dona Florinda! — Que milagre o senhor por aqui. — Vim te trazer esse humilde presente. — Não quer entrar pra tomar um xícara de café? — Não seria muito incômodo? — Ah, claro que não, pode entrar. — Depois da senhora.
531	ronetteloverz	Superman had a bit part in the movie.
532	Janette Walker	Thank you so much. Lovely memory.
533	Linda Ranches	so nostalgic....its touching...emotional!
534	extremechaser91	nella storia del cinema mondiale semmai ;))
535	Mary H	Oh Scarlett!
536	HepburnLove	The greatest movie of all time, no doubt!
537	nicolas villegas	it was ingrid bergman who was supposed to play the lead role of scarlet o hara but unfortunately she backed out because of some other film commitments and vivien leigh got the role.
538	extremechaser91	i love the intro =P
539	TheEpona92	The funny thing about wind is that what it can blow away, it can also carry back to us in time.
540	lindelandable	Don't blame the people ,blame the movie makers ,who don't have the courage to make a real movie .The kids can't watch a film that hasn't been made.
541	nicolas villegas	clark gable,vivien leigh,leslie howard,and olivia de havilland,
542	Francesca Riley	I'm welling up too. It's so emotional
543	Sophie Evans	this song just instantly makes me well up
544	Hank Lukas	we use to have a movie show on tv here in New York, t was called The Million Dollar Movie, and they used this for programs theme. I heard on that program before I foundout it was from Gone With The Wind.
545	Hank Lukas	I love this song it is so outstanding. At points powerful.
546	shirley Chandler	the music,the story ,the stars= perfection thats never been repeated!!!!
547	brookers317	dear uploader, i love you
548	AndreiTupolev	One Direction? One Dimensional more like.

553	Peter Pan	EternalLveStory08, Thank youuu...
554	gwtwvivien	"As much as I know, in France GWTW was first premiered in 1947... after WWII- MGM sent a copy of the film to Paris, in 1940, but Hitler stole it- This is an Historical fact, also my grandmother, who was french, told me this- ""Waterloo Bridge"" with Vivien too was premiered in 1947- In Buenos Aires where I live, GWTW was premiered September 25 1940-"
555	Nicholas McCullough	That's not exactly true. Olivia de Havilland, (born 1916) who played Melanie, is alive, as well as Mary Anderson, (born 1920) who played Maybelle Merriweather, Alicia Rhett, who played India Wilkes, and is the oldest surviving cast memeber, (born 1915), and Mickey Kuhn, (born 1932) who played Beau Wilkes, are all still alive as of 2012.
556	gwtwvivien	The filming of GWTW began on January 1939- ended in October 1939. World premiere was in Atlanta: 15 December 1939-
557	ziggyboi1995	If the South were to ever rise again, this should be its national anthem.
558	Ryan Wilson	beautiful movie and soundtrack
559	gwtwvivien	exactly vivien was 25 in GWTW, and 37 in STREETCAR- GWTW,s filming ended in october, and vivien,s birthday was on november 5th. STREETCAR was filmed in 1950- so...36 to 37-
560	plaidcarogemm	Yeah, so I've heard. Perhaps most of the movies are actually better than they look, but there are still some pretty awful ones. And I know, trust me. My friends and I are huge fans of old music, that's pretty much what we come together for. But their love mainly stretches to the Beatles and no farther, I wish it did though. And are you serious? Wow, that's just stupid. I don't know what those people do with their lives, to be fair I don't know what I do either. but just wow.....
561	CowNamedMuffin	"""I swear, as god is my witness! I'll never be hungry again."""
562	CowNamedMuffin	and yet the sequel wasn't the same...
563	zooeyhall	"""Titanic"" is DRIVEL compared to this!"
564	Clém CleClem	Salut Sophie :)
565	Isis2410	This is real Hollywood. And that is gone. There is no more creativity. Today they make remakes, endless sequels or blockbusters with no heart. With actors with little to no talent. Of course there are exceptions, and I treasure those. But I rather keep on watching Gone with the wind or Casablanca. The REAL movies.
566	plaidcarogemm	XD
567	plaidcarogemm	Yes, those happened....
568	bigstar66	Which, ironically, was my favorite movie until I saw this. Titanic is an excellent movie too.
569	Tamara alsammaraie	unfortunately real movies ,real singers, real music,are all gone with the wind music movies like that should had more than 100 millions views ,but unfortunately most or many of people today listen and watch disgusting movies and songs
570	bigstar66	This is like the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
571	bigstar66	'51, when she was 38 or so.
572	bigstar66	I live in Alabama, but always sided with the North when studying the Civil War in school, choosing the US over the South. I saw this movie thinking nothing could change my mind. In the first five minutes my mind was changed, and this theme perfectly sums of the glory and loss of what once was.
573	bigstar66	I dunno about 60's but she was still beautiful in Streetcar, and she was like 40 in that.
574	plaidcarogemm	Yeah, so I must've figured. I imagine she must've prettier, but hey, at least she's still here.
575	willis636	"Ehh, I didn't actually think the Dark Knight was particularly special on Zimmer's part. It served its purpose marvelously within the movie but, for me, fails to stand up on its own. Hedwig's Theme however, is one of the greatest pieces of film scoring of all time. Williams captures the entire magical world in a five minute song. Disney's ""Brave"" was the only soundtrack I have really despised, which modern soundtracks do you take issue with? (Btw I've had a crush on Natalie Portman since I was 8)"
576	plaidcarogemm	I know, there are many great composes out there. However, many of the movie soundtracks suck. I like the ones for the Dark Knight, Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes, and you know all the stuff. Oh, and the Pixar films, as from Michael Giachinno. And I said beautiful, not hot. To me, that's an entirely different level, and I never thought Natalie Portman was so gorgeous.
577	willis636	I respectfully disagree. I find the original soundtracks of the post-1960's era of film scoring brilliant, and extremely powerful. John Williams, Hanz Zimmer, Thomas Newman (especially Any Other Name), Rachel Portman, and Gustavo Santaolalla are just a few genius composers with stunning soundtracks. Also Natalie Portman is hot.
578	Emma C	I read this book in 4th grade and I have the movie....why oh why did the author have to die in the middle of writing the sequel???? :( and for some reason.....I used to be obsessed with Scarlett o'hara's eyebrows...?
579	龍樟蔡	飄~~~ 聽說明天過後一個月內 阿飄會很多
580	bigstar66	Although what you said about actresses is completely true, you're missing the jewels that come out of today's cinema. There were bad movies back then, but they aren't remembered. You're not forced to dig through all crap that was produced in the Golden Age, because only the true classics have stood the test of time. Today however, both good and bad movies are in theaters, and you do have to look somewhat hard for the truly good ones. But there are some made every year.
581	izzy Honey	one of best movies ever.such a legend this movie.amazing.love this song <3 and Vivien Leigh was so talented and SO god damn GORGEOUS.amazing actress.one a kind.wish she was here still today :(
582	ODAIR DOS SANTOS QUADROS	I WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
583	ODAIR DOS SANTOS QUADROS	WHERE CAN I TO WHACTH THIS THE MOVIE COMPLETE\?
584	jaybeegeeful	Tara's theme is a song from MG1/S
585	ThePendraGonKin13	this song takes me to places I've never been, like plantations and countrysides. I've watched this movie a dozen times :)))
586	rebecca mestica	I love this movie sooo much! So as the theme song...How I love Vivien Leigh, she has the most naive and beautiful face in the whole world!
587	Coffee Grass	I do too but today's age they are not practical.. Can you imagine going down to subway or riding a bus with them lol
588	UltimateGamerx24	I watched this for the first time yesterday, i was in awe the whole time an absolute masterpiece and one of my favorite movies.
589	Rademacher Andreas	The films of films! Hollywoods best film! Over 70 years this is the film, where I get tears in my eyes!
590	taraloha1	I was named for this movie (Tara). This song was the one I walked down the aisle to at my wedding.
591	Ciro Oliveira	O filme mais bonito que ja vi
592	Alina-Laura Estrada	i love those dresses..why don't them come back
593	jaybeegeeful	Was anyone else looking for MGS?
594	Funny Bear Ice Cream	Profesor Jirafales Doña Florinda Que milagro que viene por acá Vine a traerle este humilde obsequio Ahh, son hermosas. pero no gusta pasar a tomas una tacita de café? No será mucha molestia? De ninguna manera, pase usted Después de usted Ahh gracias
595	Anna Wyn	"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" I can't help it. I hate Scarlett for pushing Rhett away! Why in God's name would you choose Ashley over Rhett anyway?!?! FOOL. Awesome film though. :')"
596	Bcutter	@1127zephyr Yes, and a horse and buggy is much better than a car.
597	SomedayWellFly	@Carlover0529 I'm currently in the car on my way back from having seen that! Fantastic show.
598	Genevieve Fisher	My mama sure did raise me right, I grew up watching this movie. My friend had never seen it, I just watched it with her for her first time yesterday. Seeing a young person with little interest in classic movies react so emotionally reminds me of what an epic Gone With the Wind really is.
599	cnr f	@taartje87 what's your name?
600	Jullie Santos	AE PROFESSOR LINGUIÇA E VELHA COROCA DO 14
601	Danian Dare	Great, lovely.
602	Katie	@taartje87 I got my name from Gone With The Wind too!! Hehe
603	gooched	Fuckin' Hattie McDaniel god bless!
604	CandaceWhite	@lowkeygoddess Mine too!!!! =)
605	plaidcarogemm	@harrypotteranddobby Hi, I've been trying to reach my comments page but it won't turn up! Quite annoying.
606	plaidcarogemm	I know it doesn't matter at all, but did anyone notice how actresses back then are much prettier than they are today. Not only that, but the movies were kinder, more exciting. They gave a larger thrill. The music was more realistic, more poetic, more beautiful. I wonder what happened...
607	plaidcarogemm	@Whatdidyoudotome Yeah, I read it when I was your age. It was an amazing read. So sorrowful, one of the only books to make me cry.
608	0012008101689	大地賛歌って気がします。
609	Philip Thompson	Great music. Great movie, Great actors and a Great story.
610	Tara Caudill	my name's tara (: this is one of my absolute favorite movies. they dont make classics like this anymore
611	Che Davis	This is and will remain always a GREAT. We are not so blessed now with movies of this standard.
612	We're up all night to get Chucky	BEST MOVIE EVER! I don't know why but I just love this movie so much! It is classic :)
613	thegirlwhohatesrap	There's a reason Gone With the Wind only had one version.
614	tarou00019	皆明日考えよう。 明日は明日の太陽が昇る。
615	Whatdidyoudotome	@MrSamwiseable I'm a twelve year old girl and I've read the book and watched the movie.... It's not weird for anyone to like this movie.
616	Rebecca Kelly	I love this theme, everytime I feel down or cannot accomplish anything I play this!
617	tanya newberry	@boy18inva Im 38, and didn't find myself liking these types of movies until I was 27 or 28....BUT this movie I HAVE ALWAYS ADORE......FOR SOME REASON.........They don't make these types of movies anymore.......I wish they did.....but it's, good to look back on them, and to see what started it all.
618	TheRealmsOfGold	"@boy18inva No, you're just smart. I grew up on ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre."" Movies from that era had stronger drama than most mainstream movies today. I think it has to do with A) growing need for gratification in U.S. culture and B) changing class structure, but those are really just intuitions—I'm no sociologist. Anyhow, they sure don't write scores the way they used to. This is outstanding stuff."
619	mtsumusic	Umm...played by which Philharmonic Orchestra?
620	Dante Mendoza	@boy18inva No at all I am a huge classic movie fan and I am 28.
621	Rezali Shahabudin	If you like this movie you have great taste and high standards!!!Hollywood doesn't produce master pieces anymore just crappy remakes because everyone has lost their creativity...
622	TheMJStevens	@boy18inva Did you find Vivien Leigh hot when you watched this?
623	EasyCompany Airborne	@boy18inva Of course it is not wierd. This theme was written by Max Steiner, who I considered the very best of film composers. The films you mention are masterpieces. Your age has nothing to do with what you like. Hell son. This film was made in 1939, before most of us were not old enough to go to get the into the theater then. Personally I also love the theme of the Magnificent Seven - Elmer Bernstein.
624	Sarah Jackson	I like how this video is basically the whole movie summed up in 4:23, instead of just pictures of the movie mashed up together for the video.
625	João Lucas	@boy18inva Yeah, I totally agreed with @MrSamwiseable I'm 14 year old and I'm a total freak in the matter of antique movies. Anyway, I don't hide this from anyone, I even post about it on social networks about this and I have a lot of friends. Be yourself, and you'll find people who have the same hobbies you do. I have plenty of friends, but sometimes I get kinda frustrated because I just don't find anyone that wants to see this epic movie. I know they'd love it ;D
626	Orcas	gone with the wind will always be my favorite film of all time !!It's a classic and will always be clark gable and vivien leigh were perfect for the roles
627	mono poly	ive seen this for the first time when i was 13 on christmas day...now im watching it at least once a year. im 23 now:) its just beautiful
628	Golf the Magic Rabbit	@boy18inva There's nothing wrong with admiring classic films! I'm 22 and I love watching old films from the classic age of Hollywood. Most are far better scripted and have superior acting and directing than the majority of films that come out in cinemas today
629	Snitter	I'm 18 and I saw this movie yesterday with my mother and younger brother. Old movies truly are remarkable and beautiful. I've spent more time watching TCM than any other channel on the tv. True, they do not make films like they used to, but if we all remember and pass on these classics with future generations there will always be a spark of hope that we could one day return to making the classics of the olden days.
630	nami345	@boy18inva It's not weird at all. I'm 20 though I'm a female and I've found myself watching more and more movies on TCM than I have in the past. In fact that seems to be my new movie channel right now. I don't watch everything on there but I appreciate a good classic most of the time. Little mistakes can lead to a great experience. I ended up watching the first Canterville Ghost on TCM because I thought it was the one I grew up with. It wasn't but it's amazing all the same and it's on my DVR.
631	arisgreece26	@boy18inva I think we should all learn a lesson from this movie, specially today, with the fiscal crisis we are going through.
632	arisgreece26	@boy18inva Why should ppl think it's weird? We are talking about one of the greatest films AND books ever. Scarlett, though sometimes too selfish (especially in the book) should be a role model for everyone. She survives a horrible war, manages to stand on her own feet again, she worked hard, she did everything needed in order to achieve her goal, that is ''never beeing hungry again, nor any of her folks''.
633	arisgreece26	@boy18inva I so feel you ;)
634	regulators88	@SweeneyWearsAllStars Thanks. I wasn't sure, but I knew it was in his late fifties.
635	regulators88	@CressidaTussaud No dip! She's the only one still living! Clark died at 56 I think Leslie died in WWII And the others died of old age I think.
636	chatchaloem	It is only 27 years ,this movie will be the hundred years old movie.....The time is so fast....I believed no one in this movie still alive....so RIP for all

640	classick10	One of the most beautiful, heart-felt, and emotion-filled movie themes ever! Max Steiner is pure genius! I love how loud this video is! Teaches all these modern people to never forget the classics!
641	slugmom	this song totally encompasses the south back then: slow paced, gentle and elegante but with sting undertones and roots. i hear it and my chest gets tight, its so beautiful!

644	na	This movie holds a special place in my heart. My mother loves this movie. She loves the book, the movie, the characters, everything about it. Because of that, I cherish and love it too. What a better time to say than on Mothers Day? Happy Mothers day everyone.
645	regulators88	There are so many amazing scences in this movie that I don't know which is my favorite! I hate that Brent and Stuart died, they were so funny!
646	marisa noelle	it sucks that they make us watch this in school becuz the kids are not mature enough the appreciate the movie and they think it is boring. so they hate it. me on the other hand, loves it.
647	Courtney Geltzeiler	The book is SOO much better, but never has a movie so fully copied the characters in a novel as this movie did. Almost scary really.
648	_Foxkatie_	loved the ending of this movie. idk why but i loved it

650	More Life	@boy18inva nope...its not wierd at all!!! im a 17 yr old guy and i like this movie too!! who cares what ppl think? its a good movie!!
651	Doy Virginia	"I'm an 18 year old guy who finds myself liking more and more these movies from the 30's and 40's. I came across GWTW one day on TCM, and I was immediately swept-up into the story. I was totally into the great scenes and the music and the whole historical concept of the movie. It led me to another movie ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" which was awesome, and then ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"", ""Casablanca"", ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" . Is this wierd of me or something? I'm afraid to tell my friends."
652	Patricia White	@citybeat60 Yes, I will agree with you ;however , since this was a part of history good or bad it was the issue of the day and the movie was written from the book by Margaret Mitchell who was from Atlanta, Georgia. She was just telling it as it was during that era from stories about her own family and relatives who were veterans of that war. I hope some day history will be written for the truth about the War Between The States, like they say the winners write the history books.
653	The Unsnobby Film Snob	i have a knack for remembering themes to films and along with the obvious ones like singin in the rain, wizard of oz and stars wars Gone with the wind is there. its a shame so many people remember the film because of the final lines, the theme is one of the most beautiful ever written. EVER
654	Patricia White	@RotnPineapplesCinema Actually your right suh , but I am the one who is wrong on the date. You see I am Miss Scarlett O'Hara of Tara plantation in Clayton County , Georgia! I was actually just a young girl when that dredfull war started...
655	I don't Want to	@SoBelleofTN so your over 72 years old?
656	simsimmidomehomeofthesimsdalesimmidome	My favorite movie ever. No their film Oscar winning or nominated can hold a candle.
657	fcs360	And on the next day, God created a movie. And he called it Gone with the Wind.
658	JIM INAWAT	Lot's of memories came back when I heard it again ... after so many years. Hauntingly beautiful. Thank you for posting.

660	TOM JACKSON	Magnificently clear hi.def. pictures. You should be proud of your effort. I also enjoyed (it goes without saying) the beautiful music, thank you. Tom
661	Archeleusgod	My favourite book.
662	William Clay	We could had a beautiful memory of the south if just we hadn't enslaved our fellow man!!!
663	Marthalla Carrig	OMG every time i hear this music it gives my goose bumps!! MY ALL TIME FAV MOVIE!! love vivien leigh! and clark gable!! they dont make them like they used to! xoxo
664	hcurrie7	My favorite book and the most beautiful actress. I love Vivien Leigh
665	terminator847	Hitler watched this movie 5 times. It is said he always hated the US until he saw this movie.
666	EasyCompany Airborne	Austrian composer Max Steiner wrote this great music. How could be fail? His tutor as school was German legend Johannes Brahms (when the word legend meant something) and at university, he was taught by Gustav Mahler, who wrote some nice music also.
667	Eva Lopez	great viedo
668	b56123	Wonderful tribute!!!!!! Brillant pictures to go with a great score.Thanks
669	Thomas Bergman	Well done. The scenes matchces the music.
670	clamdraggin	@SoBelleofTN As a young man of 16...I worked as an usher at the Lowes Grand ...but years after this movie played there. Still....I had seen the clips and could imagine the opening. Atlanta history and GWTW are forever intertwined.
671	timelessmoviemagic	Such a beautiful piece of music,timeless music and a timeless film
672	jou1900	@SoBelleofTN I didn't understand
673	Vlad Sicoe	The movie's soundtrack is just wonderful, especially this song and the one from the end:) thanks for the upload :)
674	Matheus Campos	"-""Professor Girafales..."" -""Dona Florinda..."""
675	dizwiz96	Thank you, thanks for bringing this back to life for me. It is the most wondrerful movie ever made. Margret Mitchell made these parts for these actors as if she knew before hand. This movie can never be remade, changed or updated. It stand on it's own forever. I saw it on the big screen as a young girl. No t.v. showing can give it justice. Happiness, hardship, war, famine, love and much more this movie it the height of what a movie should be. Love all of it and the music is devine.
676	Gelinika	I saw this movie with my mama when i was a lil girl...sadly, she has gone with the wind...but i still have memories....one of my fav movies of all times..thank you!
677	Tom Kaiser	Visiting Natchez, Mississippi last fall hastened me to finally read and then watch Gone with the Wind in it's entirety. The film, as good as it is, doesn't bring justice to all the facets and concepts of the Old South that Ms. Mitchell brought forth in the book. It is indeed sad that the very best aspects of the Old South are not still with it and with us. But viewing the old homes of Natchez, which escaped the war's destruction was enjoyable - and I would like to return someday.
678	hermione838	"Wonderful vid. 1:07 ""Has the war started?"" I never fail to cry on this one. She kept pushing and pushing Rhett away until he wasn't there anymore and then she realizes just oh! too late."
679	Patricia White	"For more on this Book / Movie read: ""Rhett Butler's People"" an Authorized Novel based on Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind. It is written by Donald McCaig, and it is a wonderful book that tells about Rhett's background, and what happens after he leaves Scarlett . I loved reading this book, almost as much as the GWTW novel, sooooo good! They should make a movie from this book to complete the saga."
680	Patricia White	Scarlett, was a spoiled daughter of an Irish family. I think Margaret Mitchell, wanted someone who could portray her exactly as Vivienne Leigh did. There were many who tried out for that part and none could be found until Vivienne showed up, great acting I think...She didn't realize she actually loved Rhett, until the end, blinded by her love /infatuation of Ashley Wilkes. As she grows up, she see who she really loves after all.
681	Patricia White	"I﻿ Love this movie, I was a small child living in Atlanta, Georgia when this move premiered there. ""Once there was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields, called the Old South.....Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be of Knights and of their ladies fair, of master and of slave....Look for it only in books for it is no more than a dream remembered.... A Civilization Gone With The Wind"". Thank you for bringing back the memories! Priceless!"
682	Nico	Vivienne Leigh's character Scarlet might have made her not very pretty, but Vivienne Leigh herself is indeed gorgeous and an astounding actress : D Like in the movie Waterloo Bridge gah! I cry every time!
683	Mirima Ulliel	gone with the wind is the best movie that i have ever seen! actually i think scarlett is not very pretty, but rhett is a good man, and i am so glad to see scarlett found that her favorite is rhett in the end! they are really a good couple!
684	Consuelo	Inolvidalble, bella, bella, no hay mas palabras
685	TheRealmsOfGold	"@chjkins: This is a really cool idea. Make sure you don't overlook the ""classical"" realm—most of the art music of the 20th century is practically ignored, and some of it is inspired by the same tradition that Steiner's beautiful Gone With the Wind score hearkens to! People like Prokofiev and Korngold wrote for film as well as for the concert hall, and then there's Walton, Vaughan Williams, Bernstein... even Shostakovich and Ives might be up your alley. Check 'em out!"
686	Saskobest	best movie,actress,actor and best music ever.epic movie
687	Michiko Tanaka	My very favorite movie in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD. i am so glad it was made. it was SOOOOO ROMantic. i absolutley luv romances. great vid
688	Sam Sullivan	The true definition of film epic is Gone with the Wind. Simply unparalleled in American cinema before or after. And what music!
689	Carolyn Dorr	Great video! Great movie! Awesome actors! Will always be a favorite!
