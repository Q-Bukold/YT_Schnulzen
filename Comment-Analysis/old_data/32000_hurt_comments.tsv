Tobias Kuhn	I loose it everytime June shows up and I can't stop bawling my eyes out
Clint Potts	I grew up listening to my dad listening to Johnny Cash. He had all the early albums and when he got in a particular mood, the Johnny Walker and the Johnny Cash came out. He'd sit in the dark listening to all of the old songs. When the music stopped and the lights went on, dad was himself again. Sometimes, you just need to feel some pain. I always respected Cash but it was this song that made me understand. This song made me a fan. Sometimes, you just need to Hurt.
Whitevaliantwarrior	"🎼 It doesn't matter who you are...Great, small or tiny, burnt out with nothing to your name. No matter what you have attained or all the money, fame and riches to your name. Because in the end you take nothing with you. All will stand before their Maker, Creator of all mankind, The highest, most mighty of any & everything.
( 2 Corinthians 5:10 )
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of CHRIST, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
( Romans 14:12 )
So then each one of us will give an account of himself to GOD.

And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment 🙏 🙌 ."

Delia Art	I remember fondly riding shot gun in ol' Nelly Bell my dad's second generation f series.. radio turned up with Jonny Cash. I always say with pride to this day that I grew up with the best music ever. I wish country music was the same. Oh the good times good days. One day I'm gonna buy me a truck just like my dads travel to whever the road takes me and blast Jonny Cash on the radio..
Miss Deadite	parts of this song both the NiN version and his cover are basically the relationship I have in my head with my mental illnesses. At some point I make a new mistake and they feed off of each other over and over. Never ending pain for days or weeks. I get to a point where I shut down. The pain numbs and I can function again until the next mistake and it begins again.
Sheenia S.A.R.G	This song makes u cry...I haft to say this is the sadest song Johnny Cash has ever sung its sad to see him and June gone They was the best country singers they will be missed..
Bastian Guerrero	One of the strongest voices ever been heared and it will still in the futre without doubt

IAmManWithTheGun	He died just one year after performing this cover…
Dionusia Kiata	❤❤💩💩☘️
Koheleth	I know he did A LOT of dope, but I just don't think that accounts for how poorly he aged. People of his generation surely aged poorly. I mean the man only live to be 71, would've been about 70 when he filmed this, but looked and seemed every bit of 90.  Today 70-year-olds certainly don't look young, but they didn't age that badly in comparison. And today you'll find many people in their 60s who look pretty damned good. And I'm talking rock stars who partied hard like Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, Tommy Shaw, etc. There's a quite a few who have aged really well. But people do seem to age better, not everyone, but in general. I mean, that's why you have Tom Brady playing in the NFL at 45 and other athletes--fighters even--competing professionally into their 40s. I remember when Joe Montana seemed like an old man when he went to Kansas City in his 30s.  Lot of genetic luck involved for sure, but it's important to take care  yourself too, but it's amazing that even those who don't still seem to age better than the generations before them. Probably a lot of stuff in environment is better today, no lead in the paint or gasoline anymore, probably lots of reasons for it.

Sheldon	Miss this legend more today then yesterday. RIP Johnny, never forgotten🙏
JxrZ	Not only does this hit hard, you can feel the pain in Johnny Cash’s voice. All the things he probably wishes he done differently, just like any human on the planet. We all have regrets. It’s sad world we live in and no matter how hard we try, we still have them. I told myself I wasn’t gonna do drugs when I seen D.A.R.E, but that was a lie. I’m clean now, but I did listen to this when I was high. You’ll never understand the word hate until you hated yourself

Elysha Ray	The fact that Johnny Cash did a cover of Trent Reznors song is amazing and to hear how humble Trent was about it, bewildered is amazing in itself.
Heckensteiner	John F. Kennedy, Johnathan Taylor Thomas, Johnny Cash.
David Thorton	"They say there are songs floating in air just need to reach out and grab them, it also says that everyone has a song in themselves.
This song was playing in the Heart of millions over the life of mankind, every one heard this song playing in there head, Trent Reznor was the first to bring it out to the world, Johnny Cash put the final touch on it,"
Marco Ferreira	the emotion in this song...

The Archangel Michael I Am #17	"16“Come near me and listen to this:

“From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret;
at the time it happens, I am there.”
And now the Sovereign Lord has sent me,
endowed with his Spirit.
17This is what the Lord says—
your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
“I am the Lord your God,
who teaches you what is best for you,
who directs you in the way you should go.
18If only you had paid attention to my commands,
your peace would have been like a river,
your well-being like the waves of the sea.
19Your descendants would have been like the sand,
your children like its numberless grains;
their name would never be blotted out
nor destroyed from before me.”
20Leave Babylon,
flee from the Babylonians!
Announce this with shouts of joy
and proclaim it.
Send it out to the ends of the earth;
say, “The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob.”
21They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts;
he made water flow for them from the rock;
he split the rock
and water gushed out.
22“There is no peace,” says the Lord, “for the wicked.”

Martin Connors	I still cry my eyes out, when I hear this great tune. A masterpiece. This song played on the radio, after I heard about my Maternal Grandfather's death from Coronavirus 21st January 2021 aged 92. Rest In Peace Grandfather Leslie; the world is a darker place now, without you in it. Miss you so much Grandpa. Fly High and wait for me

Constantin Goga	Antrun final  toți  murim...
Susan Jean	Wow Johnny really made this song powerful.
lorenashift	😔
Woobyca	Trent Reznor said after seeing Johnny's video that the song was no longer his. I wonder if Reznor wrote this song for Johnny and never knew it...God works in mysterious ways.
Marie de Roubaix	Magnifique, émouvant.❤😍🇫🇷🎈🇪🇺
Andrea Padilla	It still blows my mind that he didn't write this song, it was written by Nine Inch Nails!
Totally Not E	Not the biggest fan of his, but this song hits hard. Like the part I relate to is feeling like I’ll let people down and hurt them without trying. It’s the reason I have a hard letting people come close to see the mess that is underneath who I actually am.
Bodacious Tness	One of the best inner-worlds of a junkie ever performed.

Thewickedjon	pfff wow,,,
David A. Gorton	"Not sure old age is survivable and livable in any meaningful way w/o Jesus. Being old and bitter is torturous, full of recrimination. Statistics for elderly suicides are 2nd in nation behind veterans. Johnny knew Jesus in early life, that early introduction to faith all but disappeared in his wild years, but allowed him to be forgiven his failures in his last years. ""I will never leave you or forsake!"" Christ Jesus"
Kimberly Richard	Wow! Just wow!!
bobnab	this tune destroys me like no other, my deamons, my losses my life
Patriot 1974	Johnny Cash just like Nikki six both had shit fathers that sent them on the road to Self destruction thank God they found God an gave us so many years of great music
Phil Richards	This is another great cover
Phil Richards	He was your grandmother's favorite
Renaider	"Until you (we) die , everyone goes before you.
Then you leave someone when it's your turn.
It's a dirty trick this life thing plays on us because if you are privileged enough to live a long life , you are also cursed enough to lose more loved ones.
The best we can hope for is to enjoy them while they're here and honor their memories when they are gone.
It's not all so morbid though. Life is a gift and , like everything it comes at a cost.
""I would rather have loved and lost than never loved at all"" is one of my favorite sayings.
Enjoy the now."
Gentry Tipton	Thank you Johnny.

River Critter	"Tool completely stole a Led Zepplin song. Ryan Upchurch completely stole a T Grizzly song. This is every bit as good, if not better, than the remake he did of the Soundgarden song Rusty Cage.

Space Elf Downlink	I have never seen the video before, heard it plenty.  but now I know why Trent basically said its no longer his song.
Praise Nation Kids	This song and video are...it's just not fair...ruthless to the emotions.
Arnold Blashak	This is all about June Carter
Wes Baumguardner	Perhaps I am biased, but I prefer the original.  Cash is so monotoned and almost expressionless throughout the entire song that it sounds almost robotic to me.  Perhaps people take this monotone expressionless voice as a man coming to grips with his mortality in casual acceptance, which I understand, but I still do not think that makes it as exceptionally great of a performance as many people do.
Justin Young	Check out the ishayas ascension for a better life.

He left us who remain with the hope of eternal salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord! Don't miss what he tried to impart to us. Johnny Cash lived it. He absolutely knew of what he spoke!

Lawrence Begg	This song hit home because I was up last month a life long drug addict
Ashley Banks	My boyfriend Joker Pugh made me listen to this. He's just 23 & I'm 22. I still wonder why he listens to such at his age. Not my type of song but I think it has lots to say about how he feels inside him. I hope to love him better ❤

Slightly Damaged	This makes me cry every time. Cash really made hurt his, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
Gone Full Trad	Whenever I am thinking that  I lack emotion or like I have just shut myself off to the world with a coldness towards suffering or pain I remind myself to watch this video and it comforts me in knowing that I m still here and that I do actually feel emotions . I watch people wither and die for a living (cancer center) and its songs like this that keeps me connected to humanity and life.

Mr. Bogs	"Someone please tell me I'm not crazy. I remember seeing this exact video many years ago. Then a few ago, when it was ""remastered"" or reuploaded to YouTube in HD format, the clips of Jesus were removed. I thought I was insane, until I had found a low quality upload on some random website. I compared the two and noted that the one on YouTube was in fact different than the original. Now, I pull up the video on YouTube and Jesus is in it again. Has anyone else recognized this?!"

tlc1145	The greatest cover of all times.  I'm glad he lived long enough to make this amazing song.
Eternally Thankful 3771	This video of Cash doing Trent's song is just THE most emotional I've ever gotten over a music vid - it gets me EVERY SINGLE time I watch it.  I in ZERO way want to detract from the song , but I didn't like it when NIN did it...just couldn't relate so it didn't reach me...ZERO hate or disrespect...it just didn't move me because of where I was at at that time.  Then I watched a video interview about Cash wanting to do the song and Trent's ok with doing so...watched the video and I was floored....truly , whole-heartedly emotional...WOW !!   The video and it's message speaks for itself and needs NO explanation from me as to why it is SO powerful.  The ADDED power comes from my realization that Trent , not only by giving his permission to cover the song , but the arrival of Trent himself at a place where he can acknowledge another artist's greatness with the piece AND be completely happy with letting go of the song for Johnny's legacy - it just so much about how much Trent has grown as a human being and a man - I hope he realizes the beauty , growth and accomplishment of himself in this journey.  Much respect to both artists , the video director and all who made this loving achievement possible.
LeeLee Me	"Her face. Knowing this would be his last video. Knowing first hand what he had and lost to age and time. That blink said it all.
You youngsters need to remember - where we go, you too will follow. Be kind to your elders. Learn lessons from them.
One day it will be you counting down the last days."

Martijn Talma	"promised myself not to cry.

FERNANDO CONTRERAS DEL ANGEL	Gracias johnny cash por está canción ❤
ItMadeMeSignUp	My favorite story about this song is that when Trent Reznor heard this cover, he said, well, it's Johnny's song, now.

BixLives32	"Johnny and June, June and Johnny.  A matched set of two unique, individuals.  Each had their own song writing style, quite different from each other.  June probably wrote significantly more songs than Johnny.  I have not heard a song written by either of them that I did not like, ...A LOT.   I have not compared their publishing catalogues, but I am fairly sure that June's songwriting was more prolific.   
Johnny's great talent seemed to be his impeccable taste, and ability to find superior songs. Johnny Cash was able to uniquely interpret and perform a song so that the song would forever be identified with Cash.  Despite this daunting ability, other performers continue to cover Johnny's interpretations of songs written by others.  (I haven't that much courage).  When Johnny Cash performed a song it was his forever.  
One oddity in Cash's career is ""The Folsom Prison Blues"".  Even today, Johnny is listed as the song's writer.  Nope.  The song was written by Gordon Jenkins as the ""The Second Dream - The Conductor"" on the seminal, thematic album, ""Seven Dreams"" (1954) by Gordon Jenkins on Decca.  I mention this because this was THE first microgroove, long playing record to boast a contiguous theme without the usual banding between cuts (like the Beatles, Sgt Peppers).  Seven Dreams was a milestone and I recommend this record , —if you can find a copy!  It was released on CD, but the tapes were old and the digital master done poorly.  I have a clean copy of the original Decca (""Unbreakable"") record, and have faithfully remastered it using professional gear.  I wish I could give you all a copy.  It remains an important record and quite enjoyable.    
I suspect that  Johnny wrote his version of ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" shortly prior to the concert.  That Cash used Gordon Jenkins music and lyrics as a vehicle for ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" was likely NOT a conscious act of plagiarism.  I suspect that Johnny believed that he desperately needed new material that would relate to the prisoners and show them that he was NOT influenced by the prison authorities.  Johnny simply substituted a few words to the Gordon Jenkins song, thus, forever branding the song his own.  It's not important who wrote the song, but that Johnny had the taste and sense to make the song his own and appropriate for his unusual and dangerous audience.   The inmate audience did NOT riot.   There was even some mixing of black and white prisoners (unthinkable at that time).  To a man, the inmates were well behaved and had a great time.  Plus, Johnny was able to make the concert part of his personal moral statement that he felt was central to his life.  Only Johnny Cash could have bought off this great performance. 
Any person, abused, tread upon, or who feels themselves injured, will find HEALING in Johnny and June's work.   
Oddly, many people thought Johnny had served prison time (not true); —probably confusing Johnny with Merle Haggard, as well as a couple of minor arrests Johnny suffered in two small southern towns while he was touring.  They were errors of police judgement and Johnny was released in the morning.  When touring back then, particularly in The South, most artists knew to stay close to the hotel (or private home, if they were a black artist).  Jim Crow ruled for many years.  
If the prison officials had known about the song, I am sure they would have insisted that Cash NOT play the song.  No joke, EVERYONE was scared out of their wits, prior to the concert.  I am sure Johnny did not intentionally lift the song, plus, the original song was a 1 - 4 - 5 based blues.  The Gordon Jenkins record was obviously an important work and heard by many people in the industry.  Johnny would surely have heard the original.  I have heard that  Johnny financially settled with Decca and Gordon Jenkins as soon as he was informed of the plagiarism.    
The Folsom Prison concert was , perhaps, the bravest act of any performing artist in history.  Columbia  Records desperately tried to thwart the project, but Cash was intent.  As he was selling a LOT of records,  Johnny was able (barely) to make it all happen.  The Folsom Warden and other CA State prison officials were also against the project.  All the ""experts"" were predicting a riot.  The movie did not show nearly the anxiety over the project.  Moreover, Johnny and June were scared beyond any other concert they had performed.   How Johnny and June manage to make the Folsom project happen is beyond me. 

If you like this music, have a listen to June's last few records, particularly, ""Press On"".  The entire album works as a whole and could easily be labelled a masterpiece.  ""Gatsby's Restaurant"", ""Tiffany Anastasia Lowe"" and ""I Used To Be Somebody"" are songs that I found unusually affecting and entertaining. Norman Blake's work is wonderful; —simple and pure soul.  Marty Stuart is also on the record and plays as you would expect; —perfect.   The album sounds like people in a living room playing and having a nice evening.  There is great humour, however, there are also points at which you might find yourself crying..."
Steffen Würtz	Cool
Deborah Garcia	never never never ever as u would say...never again. it was like attempted murder to me. im dead to you now and i will never be resurrected....good luck???? i think not unless good luck is what i salvaged from a relationship gone SERIOUSLY WRONG. ONE THAT I WAS MORE THAN A FOOL TO PURSUE.  ..PEOPLE ARE NOT DISPOSABLE...AT LEAST IM NOT.
Deborah Garcia	one day u will listen to this tom and u will remember......goodbye forever
ivanyurkinov	the regrets and pain felt here is directly from the loss of his partner, and best friend. when she passed away it was more then he could carry. the man died of a broken heart and would have given every thing he owned to have her back .

Jonathan Jollimore	You can tell when someone pours there hart in something and it show Johnny knew his time was coming to an end and Trent's lyrics are pure hart
Jdog5755	IMO losing Jonny cash was the biggest tragedy that has befallen the human race.

Ken Meadows	This will be played at my funeral
Death2Weebs	You gotta get with the times
PC Classic Golf	Talk about an old man making a young man feel like he accomplished something major in his life! Johnny brought depth and emotion to this song which is most likely going to be known as his Swan Song.  Forever JC! 🎶

Patrick O'Neal	I remember when this was played regularly on CMT in 2003. Clearly this video was shot before the passing of his wife, June Carter. I think this is one of the most powerful music videos ever made in ANY genre of music. I certainly think “Hurt” has become his requiem.
Carl grahan Gahan	He truly was is the cash the man was is  good for all

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Robert Felsing	This isn’t just a song, it’s a moment in time that cannot be repeated. Only Johnny Cash could have sung this song the way he did, and he could only sing it the way he did after a lifetime of being Johnny Cash. God bless Trent Reznor for giving him the platform to do so.

Gerry Bozarth	Considering that Trent Reznor didn't write this song specifically for Johnny it sure fit his life story.

Michael Mannucci	"The comment section is full of NIN fans who desperately need to let everyone know Cash didn’t write it.

Like, ok, we get it! I mean, I think this cover shows that there’s more to a good song than good lyrics. The original isn’t a very good song. Cash took the good lyrics and general structure and made a good song.

*ducks from all the angry NIN fans*"
mkrool	honestly one of the best covers of a nin song ever but i still prefer the original

ZAJ	I remember my mom being a fan of Cash. Lately I have been thinking about her again. Because despite the fact she walked out of my life with no regard for the family she was tearing apart, and how much I hate that she did that to me... I still loved her. And I've found myself tearing up sometimes when I listen to this song because, it's such a profound expression of regret and yearning. Often I've found myself struggling with the hole left inside of me because of my mom. It's led me down an unstable road due to how that deep loss struck my mental health. My mom might be someone else now. But I'm still here, right now, and I want to become something better despite how I lost her. I truly want to be someone better than what losing her the way I did had made me into. I end up drawn to this song, because I've done a lot of things to make people hurt, done things that I deeply regret, and I always yearn to start anew somehow. I want to find a way, like that closing lyric. It's strange how a song by an artist that my estranged mother loved, has still found such a deep comforting connection to me. It's simply reassuring, humbling, and profound.

He makes all things new. He even gives new hearts to those who turn to Him. He says to forget the past and look forward to an eternal future with Him in paradise.

I can't believe he passed away in 2003 a few months after his wife passed away. Is this song about regret? Is it a song of bitterness? Is it recognition? It's a message that he was it making everything transparent?
It got to me. I can't believe it will be 20 years since his death!!!

Não acredito que ele faleceu em 2003, alguns meses depois que sua esposa faleceu. Essa música é sobre arrependimento? É uma canção de amargura? É reconhecimento? É uma mensagem que estava deixando tudo em pratos limpos?
Isso me pegou! Nem acredito que já se passaram 20 anos desde a morte dele!!!"

Lauri H.T.	"I met JC when I was 17. He and his wife's bus broke down outside Coquille Oregon ... So they came back to Coos Bay and did an impromptu concert at Marshfield High School. I was a part of a community theater that did a program called ""Little Ole Opry""... So wjen our director heard Johnny Cash was doing a show, she got all us Opry dancers down there. The house was packed, for an impromptu! Small town.. News go quick! So we're in the front row and he sees us girls all gussied up in our Opry dance dresses and calls us up! We only danced to old bluegrass songs like Foggy Mountain Breakdown and such... But the band only knew The Devil Went Down to Georgia... So we got up and danced to that 😁💕 Johnny and June were so gracious and lovely. He even signed my dance shoe after we performed. Most memorable experience in my life... Besides giving birth to my 2 beautiful children and also meeting Mikhail Barishyshikov.. And he signed my ballet shoes too! But anyways, I love Johnny Cash cuz he was so humble and sweet and just a good good man. 💛🙏 RIP"

JB Wood	A hauntingly beautiful masterpiece. Mr Cash seems to be bearing his soul. It gives me chills whenever I hear it. It is timeless...
Βασίλης Ξενικάκης	Perhaps the greatest cover of a song ever, right next to All Along the Watchtower and Knocking on Heavens Door. The impact that the time period of Cash's life has in the cover is so massive. I've never heard a song that takes a bigger and harder hit each time I listen to it, as my time in this world passes. Truly amazing.
Roller Girl	Trent should see this song as flattery. Yes Johnny out did him and made it HIS song but for good reason. He was the OG. And as much as Trent has suffered in his life Johnny suffered more if only through age and experience. You can just feel the loss of his brother, growing up literally dirt poor, decades of drug addiction heartbreak and loss and more then anything? REGRET. He just wants to go back and start his life over when he’s so close to death. This would have been a good song for Elvis to cover too but he died a decade before it was written. It’s impossible to watch this without crying 💔😞 At least Johnny had his wife
Dwight Walker II	I feel you my brother...
Stay Primal	Hard not to cry listening this

Maciek G	The song about choices we made in ouer life as 22 years old i feel the weight of my decisions many things i done wrong but it’s never to late for change if you stil living you can change. Cash sings about his life ful of peyn and hard decisions. This song is like his final conversation witch God.

DEATH	Pov: every emo girl
Venss	Heard this song about 5 years ago in the Logan trailer. Since that day I've been hooked and back then I just loved how the song sounded it was a beautiful ryhmic old western type. But as I got older, I realize my views on the song start to change. And I know 5 years Woah no biggie but 5 years can change a person. As i got older, I realized it was a change of perspective. It's simply just weird...

Benzoxxcrystlexoxo	Fuck man this song will always remind me of my grandpa he is still alive but quickly deteriorating and it’s sad to see him slowly rot from Parkinson’s he loved Johnny cash and loved to sing his songs actually he was even born the same year as Johnny man this pain is not pleasant even being born in gen z (2005) I can still appreciate old music from legends like this

Liam	nicee
Todd Branston	Thanks much to Mr. Cash  - this song serves as a reminder that I've come a long way.  I no longer need to stick a needle in my arm. More than 42 years sober and I'm so grateful to the opportunity given to me by my grandparents.
zachman893	i infinitely like this version of hurt the best. so much emotion in johnnys tone, like hes reliving his past with every word.
Peter von Feldt	R.I.P music legend. His music and my memories of his music still live on better than the crap movie documentary ever will.
Sheldon C Edward Thibault	Johnny was probably 70 at the time of the making of this video, he passed away at 71 in 2003! In this video Cash looks way older than 70, he looks like he's 85!
Alex Pazmino	The man myth the legend.
Kev Hill	This song by the 9inch nails was a great song already. But JC took it to new heights. A great song ending for an amazing man.
Brett Yon	I'm sitting here, smoking a cigarette and dreading going to work.  Just listening to Johnny Cash and drinking coffee.  Off to another new year, greeting it with blunt steel.
Byron Marmol	I just googled it and Johnny Cash had a stellium in piscis, with the ascendant there and a Mercury in joy but in Fall/Detriment there in the 1st house, with the moon in Scorpio and Saturn in Rulership in the 12th house :( imagine feeling feelings that way!
Andy Gold	Pain & love  is the only real feeling in this world!…
Marcin Grabowski	I'm really sorry for Raznos, as he wrote a perfect song....but Johnny made them meaningful.....
Adam B	I love all the people fighting over Trent Reznor and Johnny Cash. They both don’t give a fuck about what anyone thinks about who did it better.
wallace byron	brings tears to my eyes, this is so deep

J D	"If I could do it all over again.I would start by being a better person.Because in  this life I was not a good man.I lied.I hurt people.And with time all the people I loved and hurt ,died away.I would give my entire fortune to do it all over again.This time,I'd do it right.I would be a good person.I'd make it work.
To me Mr. Cash was repenting all of his sins.To whom ever he may have hurt.
And most of all to his maker.This song came along right as he was to die and it was a 
given that he sung it."
JWM	the goose bumps never stop
Samuel.J.Barker	"It's sad to me how so many have heard this, but not fully acknowledged the message.
Johnny Cash lived a long life full of success and material wealth, in fact his life was overrun with the necessity to maintain his empire.
At the time of the recording of Hurt, when Cash was 71, he'd realised the superficiality of it all. He'd reached the end of the line, looked back at his empire and saw it was nothing but dirt. What was worse is the fact, the higher the heights you reach, the harder it is you'll fall. Age is not kind to anyone, but someone dependent on image far less. If he could, he would trade it all to start again and keep HIMSELF. Fame and money won't embrace you when you're dying, neither will memories of roaring crowds or moments of success. The only thing that will embrace you when you're on your way out, is the loved ones you've made in your life.
A life of fame and wealth is a life that makes this a very hard thing to achieve.
Yet nowadays it's more aspired to than it ever has been before. Cash learned the hard way, he was trying to warn you.
""Keep to yourself"" I won't reach the end of the line having chased fame to the top and roil under the pressure of the fall"
Undertaker67203	This song still fills me with strong emotions barely under control.  Never has two versions of one song conveyed such strong but differing views.  Trent was young barely keeping it together. Johnny was at the end, seeing his life in the rear view and knowing not much time lay ahead.  Both versions are so powerful.
furious warfare	continue comme ca c parfait ils faut plus de personne comme toi
Izzy Meadows	Rip you legend of a man. This is the version of this song. Fact
jennifer taylor	I remember when I first saw this amazing video, it was newly released on MTV and I got up after, amazed, but sad.. thinking wow.. he doesn’t look so good. Thinking, with June gone, I’m sure he wanted to be with her. Went to the bedroom and came out to hearing it announced that Johnny Cash had passed away.. I was dumbstruck…devastated and deeply saddened such an icon that I’ve “known” since I was a small child was gone.
Charles Kiel	Magnificent. Simply Magnificent
Kévin Atengana	The 'book of love effect'
Austin Claycomb	What an amazing video, this seems like a music video made within the last couple years. Great quality brought a tear to my eye. RIP Johnny

craig mcmillan	Smack destroyed his internal feelings it does it to everyone
craig mcmillan	John was a very troubled man
RAP 4Live	Every time I hear this song I get tears in m eyes...
MaddawgMar MMA Takes	The fact that Reznor was young when he wrote this and recorded it was sad that he faced all that at such a young age.  But for Cash to record it at the end of his life made it that much more sad, as there was no time to change it.  It added a depth of sadness to an already sad song.  Both artists are geniuses

Talon David	difficult to believe this guy was a pill head
Isaiah Voss	"20 years this year it would've been since you've been gone Johnny. This is your swan song. This is every man's song of regret from their past but has a beautiful ending ahead for the future. You knew it was your time to go but you've done it beautifully. The final lyrics ""If I could start again, a million miles away. I would keep myself, I would find a way"" describes how a career and the man you were. This piece of music describes who you were. Closing the piano at the end is a casket closed. We all miss you Johnny."
James Wilson	At 67 years old and having lost both my parents, father in law, and my best friend I find myself reflecting back more and more these days. I can feel his pain when he sings! Maybe we should all try to be a little more kind to those we love, life is much too short!

BuBaClD	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

RealLifeMaster	"Sodi Al-Fayet one ""Flüchtling"", seines Vater's Muhammad Schüler Adolf ein SingStar...???"
Gerry James	Just goes to show….Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes at the end of his life, as an appeal to successive generations, to learn before it’s too late. We see our own suffering and despair now (through Trent), and see through Johnny that it doesn’t end with experience, and through Solomon that only God can interrupt that downhill slide. Old or young, we all suffer through this life.

DarkMarxSoul	Singing about everyone going away in the end is brutal, whether it's a younger person singing about loved ones abandoning them to their depression or an old person singing about loved ones dying.
tripgreat	One of the most devastating news bulletin on Nashville radio was the announcement of Johnny Cash's death. It wasn't totally unexpected, when you knew June Carter Cash had passed away, it seemed almost inevitable. Still, it hit like certain deaths of people that seem they have always been, and will always be.  Elvis, Dan Fogelberg, Jack Benny, Mary Tyler Moore, Ray Charles. Like the sun will stop shining, and the stars will no longer light the skies. The world goes on, but seems somehow diminished.

กิตติชัย ชัยเศษ	Felix sticking with the one edible Scandinavian dish for 20 mins straight
farvista	"This became a novel. Read it or don't.
20 yr. old me really didn't know a thing. 60 yr. old me has memories of young relatives who ODed, leaving 4 little girls under the age of 10 behind, of hearing ""The baby has Downs"" when my SIL had her first child near Christmas eve, of a cousin who made the calculated choice to drink himself to death on a different Christmas eve, of holding my own 2-year-old while my husband told me ""I have a brain tumor"". (That one turned out okay, but in such a circumstance, you get an ICE-COLD, DISTILLED SHOT of what is actually IMPORTANT.) 
So many other memories, and yet so much less than SOME people have gone through. Job losses, bitter disappointments, infidelity and divorces, terrible accidents, mistakes made, opportunities missed, roads not taken. Eventually, even the most successful people become well-acquainted with loss and regret. And that's okay. These are inevitable.

My parents remember 6 weeks spent in a children's ICU, part of a terrible club of desperate parents waiting to see who would take a child home. Their outlook was not good, but nobody else's was either. Accidents, illness, one set of parents who spoke no English, hoping that the doctors in Houston could help their child who had leukemia, and my mother, who spoke Spanish, translating for the doctors that the best that they could do was to make him comfortable, that they needed to say goodbye, that there was no hope. 
Finally, their child's heart problems + viral pneumonia zeroed out, and a doctor came to THEM and said ""I'm sorry, your baby has died."" While that news was being delivered, however, some  doctors decided since that they had nothing to lose, they would take a shot in the dark, try something crazy, and they somehow managed to resuscitate the child, then get her stabilized. (She was fine, eventually.)

THAT ONE MOMENT when they they had been told that their child was DEAD, and later, when that horrible, final news GOT TAKEN BACK had an effect on every single choice my dad and mom ever made for the rest of their lives. My mother's motto became ""If everyone is okay, the rest, we can fix."" They saw the true worth of joy, and gratefulness. They NEVER missed a chance to laugh and dance, to spend time, to say ""I love you"". Let me tell you, that makes for one amazing childhood. Sometimes, we had next to nothing, but I always felt like we were so rich.

Inevitably, there will be a time when everyone is NOT okay, and you'll  realize how perfectly that one phrase distills what actually matters. Why relive the ""good old days""? Live in them RIGHT NOW. When you're happy, KNOW YOU ARE HAPPY. Pay attention, be grateful, be joyous, and try to show that truth to others. Don't be one of those folks who say ""I wish I'd known how good I had it.""
Be. Here. Now. Say ""I love you"". Go NOW, instead of tomorrow, when it might be too late. (Another bitter regret. I'm so, so sorry, Grampa.) Give to others in their need without keeping score. Abandon pettiness. Remember that you can argue with people and still love them. Never forget what truly matters. 
This is your life. Don't get so caught up in static and minutiae that you MISS IT."

Prophet	Johnny Cash told me that I'm a Genius... Are You?   🥚🐰 You're all about to find out. 🤡🗺
Gary Shissler	Johnny Cash RIP with June,your together in the end.❤🙏✌
Hogsqueal	seems about right that one of country music's biggest songs is a cover from a different genre
Clyde Scott	Still playing it in 2023
James Holbrook	The song doesn't make.much sense from a 20 something year old but this is perfect
TheEnjoyitall	This man knew how good this song was. This is his show piece, his swan song. The depth and meaning he showcased on this recording shows that even when you're not in the immediate limelight you can still blow people away by creating one of the best covers ever done. Truly, what a masterpiece from all who created it, starting with Trent Reznor.
herbmcgruffy	Happy new year what a way to start the year listening to this amazing stuff
Mark Passe	Absolutely beautiful, very moving and sad.
BodyMoving	I also spilled some of my glass of red wine today when I saw the big Johnny doing it.

Non Negotiable	I'm not into country western music besides Cash. This song ment a lot to him and needed to be brought to light. I think we can all relate to this masterpiece.
John Allsup	I watched this while halfway through this yt video about this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z9pB4yI-BQ
Zach martin	"You sing the main coarse to your girl when she asks if you'd still love her if she was worm. ""You can have it ally empire of dirt"""
jaim haas	2023 and this song is as POWERFUL as ever.  It reminds me of my feelings after Divorce.
Wesley Nichols	Saying you have regrets at 20 doesn't really mean much, you have your whole life to figure it out. But when you're Johnny's age and talking about regret, it has a whole new meaning. Johnny Cash is one of the GOAT's.
eslingur	This is a requiem for the America I loved
Jim Panse	I love the song from the first time I hear it. once i hear it i can't stop.
Evan Hughes	I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
Serge Le-Gal	best songs ive ever heared ;)  rip cashy ;) peace
 — 𝐂𝐀𝐑𝐑𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐒𝐔𝐍.	There is something very tragically beautiful about Johnny Cash's life. If there was one country musician I could name that transcended so many different genres and inspired everybody from rockers to popstars to rappers, it's him. I wouldn't say that the end of his life was the peak of his career - but it's very inspiring and bittersweet that he spent so many years in a slump after the 70s only for his music to find a new sense of love, relativity and acceptance with Gen X and Millennials. I've never been a believer in an afterlife, but if there is, I hope he's cozy somewhere and no longer struggling with feelings of depression and isolation.
andy georgiou	His leaving song, what a Christian!!
sarjus	"Одна из лучших перепевов, как собственно почти все песни из «американской» серии!
Джонни, мы не плачем, что ты умер — мы гордимся, что ты был!"
Plane Reality	What is amazing for me... I really related in many ways to the NIN cut. I never let it show externally. In those quiet moments alone... driving. I would wrestle with my internal conflicts... and that song defined a big part of it. I was in my young adulthood then. Fast foreword to now. Getting close to 50... I have lived through so so much. Tragic loss... horrible injuries... estranged loved ones... so so many regrets. I carried the world on my shoulders when young... thought I could change people... if only I loved them harder. Now looking back still constantly analyzing... finding my flaws... a meat grinder of things I can never go back to do different. Has it made me a stronger and better person... yes. I realize now slowly... to forgive. It is the only way foreword. To forgive myself... just because things were so bad... most of it is and was then out of my control. Do I still sit alone... sobbing some times. Yes. Slowly healing... learning how to Love. There was another Man that carried the World on His shoulders. Much Love and Blessings all! Jesus Christ is the Way/Truth/Life! 💪❤🙏💯
Alain Brisson	This is so emotional and powerful, I can’t tell how my feelings are when I listen to this masterpiece. Absolutely beautiful!
Jim	Johnny's wife was in treatment at the betty ford center in nineteen eighty 9, Johnny would come there for lunch every day to visit his wife I got to meet them both while I was there for 30 days They are very very very nice people i'm glad I got to meet them
BonSang	when you are young you look like yo parents, when you are old you look like your choices.
Jim Eagle	Nobody remembers that this is a NIN song?  That’s odd.  Trent Rezner wrote and recorded this in the 90s
J Lisko	There has never been a more perfect and literal swan song than this. For anyone else. Likely never will be another.
Mansur Haq	Amazing lyrics! Such a deep and moving masterpeice..
Beau Stange	GREAT video! I was a Nine inch Nails fan and enjoyed some of Johnny’s early work. I honestly don’t know if I discovered this song by Johnny for about 5-7 years after it came out. When I’m feeling the pain of everyday life I’ll listen to it at the gym to remind me that many have suffered far worse. Thank you!
Frederick Lepage	Sa pogne à coeur ostie oui tes mon idole reste fort 🤟🤟🤟✌️🤙👍

Kris One	Finally,THE MAN COMES AROUND. THEIRS NO GRAVE THAT CAN HOLD MY BODY DOWN!!! 🎹✝️💔✝️
Tyson Thomas	Trent Reznor made a beautifully haunting song.  Johnny Cash took it and ripped everyone's heart out!  The pain in his voice says it all!  Dang, even when Reznor sang it.... PAIN!  Both are legends!
rhys aston	I'm only 23 years old and have made quite a few mistakes that I sorly regret and brings me to tears whenever I think about them too much. This man was much older than I am and has definitely made a lot more life changing decions that I have even when he was my age. This is a man who has regretted many of them. I see this song as a confession of these decisions and as advice from a wise old man to be careful of your decisions and that living life to the fullest doesn't always mean having the finer things in life. Thank you for your wisdom Mr Cash.
Bayne Bogdanov	Reznor can’t be mad!! Shit!! Johnny Cash
GG	One of, if not The Greatest Cover of All Time!
Candice Perry	I can't describe the feeling this song gives me but very emotional

Pelaw Keith	Mesmerising such a beautiful song sung perfectly
Kinoga Michael	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Ben Sturm	I wonder how this touches trent. Because it completely crushes me.
chuck canuck	The greatest cover in the history of music videos.
seraj mehrabkhani	shout out to Rick Rubin
Tea	Rest in Peace, Johnny
frailty	"as someone who went from being a hobbyist video editor to a hobbyist musician, this music video is a masterpiece by the way it utilizes both. 

its not just the song that makes it so powerful, its the video as well, the way it cuts to videos of Johnny earlier in life over certain lyrics. People overuse the word ""haunting"" in my opinion but I cannot think of a more fitting description. it sort of stays and lingers in your mind for a while."
Jim Rose	"The vocals are great but something is wrong with the key in this version...it least that's the way it plays back for me
 Anyone else or am I losing it ?"
Suzanne	Love you Johnny
Sephiroth Joutsen	As a hard core Nine Inch Nails fan, when this first came out, I didn't know what to think about it.  Trent Reznor wrote it back in the mid 90's about his struggle with Heroin Addiction.  I have grown to love this version and I understand why Trent signed over the rights of the song to Johnny Cash and his family.
Jim Grant	IMO this is one of the greatest, arguably the greatest, music videos ever recorded. This is a true masterwork by Mark Romanek and Rick Ruben. Stunning.
iTz Olie	What an incredible thing music is... for a cover of a song to convey a completely different meaning is just unbelievable. Thank whoever you need to that we have music because, I guarantee you, we wouldn’t be here without it.
Flow Euphoria	It hurts to relate to this as much today as it did 12 years ago
Jordan Garner	This song came on in the car on the night of my first date with my girlfriend who passed away by suicide recently. I still vividly remember her asking me the name of it and how she really liked it. So every time I listen to this song I think of her very deeply and my own hurt.
Mr. Middleton	"2:25
This song changed a lot for me, I see it as more than a cover which I’m sure a lot of people see it the same way.
It’s a matter of realisation and regret and coming to terms with what you’ve done and accomplished in life, I’m not old to where I can reminisce, but I’m old enough to know life is limited and will end eventually. I hope everyone who watches this music video and sees this comment has an amazing life as I may not meet you, but you all deserve amazing opportunities and outcomes. Be yourself and be happy"
magnolia Nunn	Love him....💕
Sunshine Moon	Listen to Johnny Cash's sings before he had passed you can have my empire but you have dirt meaning he was I can relate leeches people just wanting everybody it's anyway I don't have to explain myself those who are older maybe we'll understand those
garyryan52	I was raised in the 50 and 60s and loved Cash. My son was a Nine Inch Nails fan and when this video came out I explained a what the images were of. He looked at me and said this is the greatest video ever made. I told him it just told a story and that's what most Cash songs did.

 E= MC², this thing Noel Scum f'ears actually is part of what the Kreatori Destoy R is, ALL of THAT is The Foundations of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
  This I know so well as I have experienced the presence of The lord for the last years ago way to this point I'm attempting to make, as Johnny Cash waits, and he shall start playing his song, WRITTEN for The Creator of ALL THINGS.
  I am being used as a governor, 
of sorts, perhaps a point of origin, a .P'eon, a .beacon, a ¡'eacon,, a qeacon, something embedded into a two dimensional substrate that receives and sends information.  It can also be usedas an adjustment monitor  and this is exactly what is taking place while I am listening to music on my smartphone.. my emotions are being monitored and by carefully analyzing my state of being to that state of being of the smartphone, in exact t times and in this Space my state of being is dialed in with exact precision. 
  The state of being of one human, IS USED, as a Transmission T'owe R.

Frederick Coppenhagen	this song has gotten me through so much in my life. Just a reminder that even when you feel empty and alone, you go through hell just to make others feel love when you don't.
Mike Ruzza	The first few notes give me tears. This song belongs to Johnny Cash now. Nine Inch Nails knows Johnny took it from them. Johnny was, and is the greatest sort of troubadore made in the U.S.A. Let's rename Tennesee johnny cash!!
Paul Beaney	It scares me to get old. Not death, that's just time and time is both a friend and an enemy. What scares me is having the wisdom to look back on my life and judge myself. It scares me to have the foresight to close the piano and rest.
Braden Harris	So interesting singing this song meant something SO different to Trent and Johnny at their different ages. Amazing connection.

Davide Bertoletti	The video really enhances the power of both the music and the lyrics. Very well conceived.
Carmen Bayliss	"The NIN original is, certainly, ultra-fab, but Cash's rendition moves me more because it's more stripped-down. Plus, he's always been ""a God"" in my musical world."
David Garris	🐾🐕🐶.   Can't say anything
D B	Wow.😔
bobsuruncle	"If anyone has an empire of dirt to show for the years of ""prospecting"" for gold and riches and fame, of finding it... Johnny Cash is one of them... and he left us a legacy... not because of riches or fame, but because he was true to his giftings...and I suppose, true to the giver of those gifts... Not a perfect man... but he who is?"
Maghen Shaw	This is painful n beautiful
Kirsten Ornelas	Never loved a remake the way I love this. So much emotion and feeling there and his legacy is perfect with the lyrics.
CodenameJulia	"I’m noticing a lot of very recent comments on this video (as of 12/26/2022). So many of you have suffered. So many of you are in pain. And I understand that, so deeply - I carry a lot of hurt and healing wounds too.

Random internet people, I’m so glad you’re all still here. I’m so glad you’re all still breathing, trying, grieving, loving. We may all be strangers, but we’re still here. Whoever you are, whatever you’re going through, I love you, and I’m so glad you’re still here. Please don’t go away."

Then I realized the loss never hit me for some unknown reason. Until now. WTF! 😔"

halemcdan1	I love this song so much I bought a guitar too learn how to play it.  At the age of 50. 3 years later I still love playing it..... and I now have 7 guitars and a real appreciation of music and musicians.
Muhammet Aydın	I came here with advice of chatGPT
Reinhard Schuster	Straightforward, faithful and honest to the end. My very greatest respect Johnny.
JoeyGemini63	"The song is an apology to June for all the pain he caused her because of his drug addictions throughout their life together. He knows he doesn't have much time left to tell her he is sorry.
Trent, you are an earth angel for giving Johnny this song.  No one needed it or deserved it more that he did. It couldn't have gone to a  more appropriate  music man. No one else could have performed Hurt so powerfully and true. The age in his voice made him sound better than ever."

ItsMeGPZ	This is a man at the end of his life, every choice behind him, wracked with grief after the loss of his wife, that is so incredibly sad, this is the only song I've cried about. When you're in your 20s, you can turn things around. A man with so much talent had his success cut short, and this is his ballad to the past. The loud bits are heavier than any weight you could lift.

archiveseeker	I was a big NIN fan. I know Trent Reznor agrees that Johnny Cash successfully hijacked this song.
Matryx	whats crazy is that most of Johnny's later songs are Covers. But they became his songs through the sheer emotion he conveys through the lyrics and music.
Victor Davidson	"You’ve found a way

Jennifer LeBlanc	I used to revere this man & cried to this particular song but as I got older I realized as painfully beautiful as it is it is a narcissistic anthem. He only suffers as his vessel/ body breaks down but he broke many hearts, souls & kin on his downward spiral to his ascendance. Don't get me wrong I love his music but had realizations of his pandering arrogance. He is only regretful now because of those he harmed (ardent fans, family, mama, the downtrodden, the church, IRS & his many children) are left to question ❓ I will still listen to the music but hear it with a different pair of ears. I mean take the song about him stealing car parts off the assembly line? Iffin he was a black guy he'd have died in jail. This is a modern Grimms Fairytale.

Ezy Jamez	Listened to this song over many a number of occasions. And it reminds me of the mess-ups I have done that has lead me to this day. Listening to this reminds me how much I have done wrong to others and myself. 2 Legends sing this song, and both convey such meaning that hits deep down.
Jutta Muthig	Er war im Alter fast  noch tiefgründiger

Mee Here	FJB AN IT'S CARTEL,
gerkenator	I appreciate how he made this song his and shows at the end our flaw as people. We killed our creators flesh. Johnny Cash clearly got it.
Red Skywalker	Everyone of us is broken & beyond repair..so much that God sent his only begotten son to die for our transgressions as John 3:16 declared
Nash Brooklyn	that beating pulsing note hurts everyone who still has soul inside -
Vemost	Trent Reznor wrote a masterpiece. Poets like Trent and Johnny are of another breed. They can somehow turn the spoken word, into something tangible. Transporting us through time. Spilling their souls out for all to see. We're scared at what we're about to witness, but we must learn. They're warning us . Life isn't easy, and time is fleeting. So follow your Bliss young people!! This aint no dress rehearsal!
No One	Such a beautiful song i heard today.. Indeed a masterpiece!!
Turbo Tord	if i understand this right. The lyrics of a 20  year old man, sung by an old 70 old year to die man? Wow!  And the song is hard enough without knowning that...

Don Vito Corleone from 'The Godfather' (1972),
old Charles Foster Kane from 'Citizen Kane' (1941)."

Wesley nixon	God bless johnny cash
Justin Potvin	This is a tough watch
Cristián Navarro Parraguez	I didn't know the artist nor his history, I found this song by chance (by a prior random parody/tribute video 4 years ago). It makes me shiver and crack a little to see how well the song, tone and video convey raw emotions of regret at the end of life, one of my greatest fears. Amazing!
kato rochill	why cant anyone credit with the Orginal creator of this song Nine inch nails?
Michael Campbell	"The number of friends I have lost this year has just topped 10. That line ""everyone I know goes away in the end"" is hitting me quite hard this year as well."

robert flint	When young you have your life time ahead of you to right the wrongs.  Once your older and nearing the end, there isn't time.  It's that regret that cuts deep into your soul and hurts so much.
John	Amazing song, johnny the legend  leaves his best to last... RIP Mr Cash
OifelOifel	"Both versions of Hurt capture the artists struggle in their own way. Trents song feels different as does Johnnys. It is a wonderful song.
Knowing a little bit of Johnnys story like the broken frame with the columbia record symbolizing the label dropped him after 25 years and his wife standing on the stairs. Man that videographer deserves an award for giving Johnny the perfect visual to his wonderful version of Hurt."
Terra Traduçao	"meu pai te matou mas o profeta Ezequiel... é Ele mesmo te dará a visão do vale de ossos secos.

Daniel	I miss your dumbass Liz
Craig M	I’m only 35 and just starting to realize the voice behind those sorrows. Truly deep song, I hope my future will never let me fully understand it.
Deja Vu	I´ve fall in love with this song since the first time I listened it. Johnny Cash, American King.
HorseheadNebula85	"For me, Johnny's version of ""Hurt"" is the most unifying song in the history of popular music. You've got one of the OG standard-bearers for rock n' roll meeting with the screaming energetic voice of music's future, and creating something wonderfully powerful in that meeting. Johnny's version is so, so, SO much more impactful than the original. But it took Trent's impeccable distillation of pain and suffering in the first place to ever make this performance (by Cash) happen."
Daniel Hormann	I seen you in Asbury Park hooking up with Mr. Jimmy at the Paramount Theater Church in the Morning Jonny Cash.
Dion Larsen	Flute at the start is building , and then is known , constant shut the door

Сергей борисов	Джонни звезда мирового масштаба.
Jeff S	As people die from blood clots from a vaccine....this is the only song I think makes sense now.
over played	what a man is , thanks to hell god saved me
Lee Hawkins	It’s a testament to Trent Reznor’s brilliance and honesty in writing this song that the feelings he had as a young man in his 20s are so accessible to an old man like Johnny Cash. It proves that the best art comes from our experiences, and that we are all the same no matter our age. We feel it when young Mr. Reznor sings it—but it hits so much harder with Johnny Cash—because he is out of time. It motivates me to make good choices while I still can. Not every song can do that.
Bob The Mexican	I want the children to know this is where you came from.
Bob The Mexican	Nothing is closing.

Justice Binder	I miss you Johnny
Jestine Garneau	This song is one of the greatest songs ever made, hands down. Every single word Johnny Cash sings cuts so deep in my feelings. This is one of those greatest tracks that will quite literally NEVER get old and fits in whatever mood I'm in, I'll ALWAYS listen to this when it comes on in my playlist! R.I.P. to one of the greatest artists of the centery may you rest easy & know that your music lives on and helps potentially millions of people who have great taste in music 😍😊👏🏽
Bagel K	Beautiful music. I can't explain the feeling I have when I listen to this.
MadLad_Don23	the emotion that can be felt even through a recording of his voice just shows how much he actually was feeling while singing the song...
runnertravis	"I keep coming here to ""feel"" but I don't"
Urban gardener	I just wrote a very heartfelt article covering this song and the life of Johnny Cash. You can hear the pain in his voice. I was introduced to this man by my father when I was 9 years old. My father died about 10 years later. Back then, June Carter and Johnny Cash were national celebrities. They were together all their lives and had five kids together. But you can rest assured that their lives were not easy. I feel incredibly humbled to be fortunate enough to live at a time when I could have heard this man's music. I might have to learn this song on My guitar. But there's no way I could sing it this good. Thank you Johnny. There was no one like you. Rest in peace

PhoenixRizin	"I'm torn apart listening to this. My dad died a few days ago, and he loved loved LOVED him some Johnny Cash. Watching all the clips from Johnny's life is making me wonder what my dad had to go through in Vietnam, and how he was treated after he came back to America. People spitting on him, hurling insults, when all he did was care about us and fight for us. 

""If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself, I would find a way""

I love you Dad. I miss you."

Siodog	"""Goodbye V, and never stop fighting"""
Henry Hillier	"When I first heard this song bad in ABT 2009.. there were many times I cried every single time, I could not help crying when I heard it for 12th time I started to be able to listen to it moved something my soul..

I think this is ABT to his wife, Johnnie Cash was not an easy person to deal with.. & this song signifies ""regret"" that he let his addictions effect his wife greatly..

The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting"" indicates he may of had addictions more serious than alcohol""

& When he says ""I would keep myself, I would find a way"" I think he his referring to not getting addictions..

Even tho NIN wrote this song, I think there no person to have sung this song..

I still listen to this song quite often..

He has REGRETS, going on to sing"" you can have it all "" my empire of dirt"""

beth wrigley	What a fantastic piece of Art.
Eric Ralph	A giant among men, thanks Johnny
Will Trotter	sometimes I find this song or atleast when I was younger funny. The older I get or wiser I realize my laughter was the result or reaction of my fear of accepting of my own pain. It's like many songs outside the realm of super happy upbeat songs we hear all day in shops etc hearing a song with the truth of my emotion especially in public is harder to accept.
peter goemans	If this song doesnt move you in some form or the other you are dead inside and i dont have hope for you.

Ronnie Wylie	"I was talking with a friend about the greatest covers of all time and I listed Jimi's ALL ALONG THE WATCH TOWER, Candlebox's TURN ME LOOSE and Kentucky Headhunter's YOU'VE GOT TO HIDE YOUR LOVE AWAY as my three favorites of all-time. 

I completely forgot about this song. The reason is that Johnny made this song his own, I forget that Trent Reznor wrote it. Trent's version is darker, but Johnny's is more impactful and emotional and real. It grabs you. His voice forces you to feel every ounce of emotion that Nine Inch Nails version doesn't. 

This is the greatest cover song of all-time by far. Trent even said it isn't his song anymore. A true testament, from a great songwriter himself to a legend that lives on forever. Thank you, Rick Rubin for making this song happen."

alia	barely turnin 20 n i lost my self this year. I'm glad it happened early, I spent most of my time isolated and alone for the past few months. It helped me get back.. to me but better, and more self aware ig. The worse thing is, no one is to blame but my own mind, turning aginst itself. Had to accept responsibility to fix it on my own. Your the only one with you, make sure you're you.
Kevin Robinson	Nothing but an empire of dirt in the end, even for Cash. Glory to God through my faith in JESUS by Grace!

Peggy Huebner	My Dad  loved Johnny Cash, as a young girl I hated his music, too square and old fashioned for my taste.  I now love Johnny Cash and wish I could enjoy listening to him with my Dad.
Francis Cain	The Man in Black made this song his own. I know it was originally done by some other rock band, but I'm not sure which band, because this is a Cash song
Anthony Lover	"This song is depressing and uplifting at the same time making it a great song
It might be a good funeral song all at the same time wtf"

Judge Dredd	The one and only time a masterpiece was truly remastered
exilemike	Such an amazing video,Cash's version of this song says so much. When he closes the lid on the piano you can tell that is him saying goodbye.
Enrico Weber	I was shocked as I heard that song for the first time. And a friend told me the singer is dead. This cover of a song is a masterpiece. Thank you very much, Mister Cash.
Patrick Hooker	This makes me think of how i will look back at my life in thirty years from now. My thoughts will be how i lost the mother of my children how i met her how we became a family and our children loss of not having us together for there lives. I know in my end i will think back to us how the miracle of love became us how that miracle gave us 2 children Liam and Vayda .

Peter Mason	I'll never forget seeing my old man weeping when watching the video clip for this song for the first time. It had just been released so it must have been 2002 and I would have been 17. I knew it was a powerful song, but I didn't comprehend the depth then, I couldn't. Now 20 years later I wept too, and I think I get it now.

Greg Pearson	I'm 29 and listened to jonny cash since I was about 20. Loved him off the bat a true preformer for the people his music means so much for people he sang our thoughts that we couldn't  speak in such a way I changed my whole life he made sense when the closest to me couldn't. His music put me at ease in my later years in life I know I'm young but iv been through a lot and real musicians put me where I need to be questioning my life myself and everyone, not in a negative way at all but an understanding of life and my purpose my goals my everything. Music that does that is rare especially recently. Rip Johnny 🙏

Cliff Galbraith	Is there a greater, more moving video? The song and performance are absolutely emotionally crushing, but the imagery adds a layer of regret and pain to this tortured soul who is the real-life subject of the performance. This is beyond anything I've ever experienced in watching a music video. Cash as a young man, then his journey, and his loneliness with his wife looking on is heartbreaking. Bravo to director Mark Romanek.

LaRaNaThA	I know many legalistic Christians will think Johnny was never a believer. I would have been right with you the first few years as a believer. Then crap got real. I've read 2 books about him---one biography & one autobiography. I honestly feel like I have so much in common with Johnny Cash in the sense of his struggles.  I'm thankful for reading the Cash autobiography.  I don't believe once saved, always saved, & do whatever you want & be saved, but I truly believe Johnny was genuine, & he struggled--oh yes--but he genuinely loved the Lord. & he's with Him, now. His struggles are over.  Johnny was real & kept it real. For all people.

Its just suffering.  It is raw and true but incomplete.  Feel there needs to be a part 2 about forgiveness and redemption like Billy Joe Shavers ""I'm just an Old chunk of coal"" showing someone in a state of Hurt has hope."

Jose Aviles	For some reason today I lost count how many times I have listened to this song. I guess the older you get the harder it hits.
Tyler Acimovic	My grandfather passed away on March 15th. Everytime I hear this song, I get emotional and think about the good times. He really wanted world peace and everybody to get along. And his death was caused by hospice not feeding him. He had to ask for food. This song tugs at my heartstrings. He suffered. At least he's in heaven with God. My grandpa was a priest in the 1950s and 1960s.

ericwatson3	I’m only 27 yet this song has carried me through so many dark moments in life, listening to it in happier times truly reminds you of what it is to be alive. Not everything is happy but the fact we can feel this type of hurt makes us human, our scars remind us of where we have been and our purpose going forward.

константин корольчук	"Русня так и не обжила свою необъятную территорию, данную Богом: эскимосов споила, остальным навязала власть, приведшую в нищету даже самых хозяйственных... Таких песен не услышишь здесь,-  только про ""Варяга"", который ""навсегда"" не сдаётся, ибо окружён... Окружён людьми, а не ""терпилами""..."

Ronald Daub	"Empire of dirt in the end.
Except for the music."
GangNY GNY	сильно
Josh Toten	There are very few cover songs that I think are just as good as the original, and even fewer that manage to even outperform them. But this one.. And I say this as a HUGE fanboy of Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor since my angsty teen years... This one is pretty much the best there ever is and ever will be. It was the perfect song for Johnny to cover at this time in his life. You can feel his pain, an entire lifetime of regrets, and it just absolute breaks your heart into a million tiny little pieces. Thank you, Johnny Cash. Rest in peace.
Pipavir75	What a Song a piece of art
wafflcoptr	"This song is a message to any fucker out there who has a shallow, closed-minded opinion on new music and what they call ""real music."" Johnny Cash, The Man In Black, was old school, and we're talking really old school. He hears a song by Nine Inch Nails, a radically different, completely alien style of music from the idea of what music was in the time he came from. Nine Inch Nails is aggressive, angry, depressing music, utilizing synthesizers and sampling, not to mention a style of playing guitar totally foreign to Johnny Cash's sensibilities. But what does this giant of a music legend do? He understands the soul of the song, and he reinvented it in a way that floored Trent Reznor, completely making this song his own.

You think you know music if you dare to codify what constitutes ""real music"" and what isn't? Johnny Cash is a trillion times the artists anyone here could hope to be, and he understood that you have to be open to new ideas, new music, younger artists who are shaping the landscape that he once shaped. You don't get this level of acclaim by playing music from when you were 20 forever, no one will care about how stuck in the past you are."

elmatador81	My dad dies 11/29/22 we didn't have much of a relationship he was verbally and physically abusive . He was a strong man typical Hispanic macho man but he got hit with diabetes and was a shell of himself after that .  The last few yrs we've been in more contact especially after my son being born last july. I didn't think him dying would have affected me but it does cuz to be honest looking back it wasn't all bad. Was looking for a song to post on Instagram and this song popped up out of the blue ..just perfect cuz I know if he had the chance he would have done things differently.

Newtonian time	"""you are someone else - Im still right here. What have I become? My sweetest friend""

A hurt person locked into painful loop of depression from a monochromatic love?
Some people can't get out of broken love and one should not judge them because with time one also may learn that love  is a really really cruel biological hangover."
Adrian Mahlstede	Same lyrics, but this version of Hurt feels like it's about the pain of everything disappearing at the end of life, while the original Nine Inch Nails makes you think more about the pain of being alive.
c D.s	o coração dói muito, escutar essa música depois de ter cometido erros irreparaveis, e ser cobrada pela vida, se desse pra voltar atrás...mas não da, memória pro resto da vida, e vidas que não se reparam mais

ted n ruth	Good call Rick
don vito	"This song symbolizes to me a great sense of loss..a feeling of sorrow and regret.
For some of us it takes a lifetime to realize what's important and what's not.
By that time it's too late, we're too old to do anything about it.
It's also obvious that he longs for his youth with a desire to live his life over but in a much different way.
Johnny Cash put on free concerts for prison inmates.
He saw himself as being with them not above them."
Maris Mikelsons	still 11/10
Cars and Fun	This song makes me think of my father, he is still here, but as I type this he is going through major surgery that will change him for the rest of his life, he beat himself up over the years, shattered his back, broke his ankle, broke his wrists, knuckles, fingers, arms, shoulder, knees, the list goes on, he was untamed when he was younger, but now he’s an old man, and he is only in his late 50s, but he did a lot to make sure I was well, working 7-12s for 364 days a few years in a row. My dad is the toughest man I have ever known, and has been my greatest teacher ever, even if he is hard to deal with at times, and he knows that, but I wouldn’t be who I am without him, he is the closest living man right now to Vito Corleone, powerful, intelligent beyond measure, and wise. I love you dad, Recover fast!
Mergawi Nabi	i hurt myself today
DEBAJIT	Thank you Rick Rubin for this
petolaggante 77	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

<3"
paulrasheed	"One day when I die no one will care. My wife and kids will be at the funeral, they'll cry. But their life will go on. 10 people might show up, theyll be sad for a few days. 

Nothing will stop, nothing changes. Noone will care. Whats the word Im looking for? Im insignificant. ""Im (you're) so forgettable"" -high school girlfriend 20 fucking years ago.

Wtf is wrong with me? Why do I feel like this?"
Ted Stenzhorn	No disrespect to a legend, but this cover is godawful. Transcription is dumbed-down, phrasing is bad, it just sucks ass. Reminds me of Shinedown trying to do Simple Man. Tempo is bad, song is overwrought, over-simplified, heavy-handed and just terrible. 🤮
gary griffith	I know this sounds crazy, but this is the first time i have ever heard this song. Johnny sings it so much better than Reznor that they are not in the same league. Johnny Cash has always sung from his heart, and his songs are usually heartbreaking. this one is no different. I am 72 now, and grew up listening to Johnny Cash. Now we are old. I am surrounded by grand, and great grandchildren.  I see most of them every day. I thrive on their love. For me, life is good.
Stuart Middleton	This is one of the most poignant music videos ever produced.
Jonathan Shaw	So true.  I’ve built things up and made money.  An empire of dirt. God loved us so much that he sent his only begotten Son for our salvation. What good can I do today to emulate works shown to us? To help our fellow brother or sister. I pray to always keep this at the forefront of my heart, soul and mind.
Smokedout33	A man that as seen alot of things and done alot of things.

Executioner9000	in High school one of my good friends introduced me to this song. He loved it. I thought it was good, but eventually forgot about it. He passed in the Pandemic (unknown cause, he just never woke up) and thanks to the travel restrictions i never even got to go to his Funeral. This song hits different now. RIP Devon.

jimrebr	This song is my favorite Johnny Cash song, it gives me chills…as I age, this song hits harder and harder…❤miss Johnny and June. My birthday is two days before Roseanne’s, we are both double nickels, as my husband calls my birth year. But I am enjoying my senior years, despite the Pandemic, which has spared my husband and me, so far. All of my younger siblings have had it, all of our kids have now had it, my youngest is just getting over it, I choose to concentrate on our two beautiful grandchildren ❤
Mda87	I love you Jenna if you ever see this
Benny Shingleton	Good by Jonny
Garrett Senter	Nine inch nails said “that’s not our song anymore” after Cash covered it. Respect
justandardprocedure	"Trent's is better. 

I don't care that Trent said it's Johnny's song now. 

It was a concept album and the guy killed himself at the end."
Nick C	Live to survive only to die in the end..
Aran McGinnis	"Life is pain. Happiness is here to keep us trying...sometimes a liar. Sometimes a whore...sometimes both, but we welcome it only to learn the truth too late. 
Rest in Peace Mr. Cash. I hope you found the happiness we all seek."
Yusuke Knight	I love this song
Andro Tel	THIS interpretation is probably if not certainly the MOST sincere and profound I ever heard and watched. He puts all his guts into it. Don't know what else to say... RIP
Melinda	"I want y'all to know Johnny had happy times in his life also. He had a TV show once in which he shared some personal things about his family. His poor brother who was killed was going to be a preacher. John""s brother and sisters sang together in church and all thru their lives. It was a strong Christian foundation.  Many people loved him, but didn't really know him. the movie doesn't tell it all. We were blessed to have him with us on this planet for these 80yrs. I know he and June are walking in green meadows in Heaven right now. We miss you two."
andreasdagen	today I learned johnny cash lived into the 2000s, for some reason i thought he died in the 70s or 80s
Nitin Sharma	"""You are someone else, I am still right here...""

This hits in so many ways. No matter your age, if you had faced a loss and you still think about them."

Virgil Filipski	We are our are worst enemies
Jonathan Moore	These few minutes are more impactful than the entire Walk the Line film
Xavier	Never take anything and anyone for granted.  I lost so many friends and it was my mother's funerals 2 days ago.  It sounds crazy but I always felt she would never die.  The only thing I still have is a telephone who doesn't ring anymore and my memories who worth nothing ⚰
Jay Bee	"Hey Folks:  Just a teeny tiny tidbit.  Check out the guitar upper corner.  Signed by Gene Autry at Johnny's request.  Gene was Johnny's early inspiration.  Legend upon legend.
This video is a powerful and deep call for the reflection on just what exactly is most important in life.  Learn to live life with honor and virtue.  Only then can you live it to the fullest
and without regret.  Otherwise you will likely end up like Johnny."
Chris Holzhauer	This performance will never lose it's potency and strength. Mr. Cash's swan song. His music and his memory will always have a tender spot in my heart.
The Lost Viking 999	This is one of the most beautiful things ever created. It’s absolutely perfect.
bear9018	This hits different
Glendon Wagers	Go watch the redemption of Johnny Cash the movie it will give you a whole new appreciation of this song !!!

JPeg 2303	WAX
Tiffany O'Brien	"I had this on repeat at ten years old. Now 28. 
I was going through and have been through incredible pain, physical and mental health; I became numb to everything and everyone around me.
They took everything from me. I felt better numb to help me not feel the pain.
I gave up. People left, rejected, and abused me. I don't think people understand the meaning behind this incredible song unless they've gone through similar life experiences.
This song helped me feel less alone. I'm forever grateful to Johnny and this song."
D Harrell	One of the greatest music videos I have ever seen and a beautiful but sad tribute to a true legend
Synthesizer Patel	"When the lights go out our civilisation - which won't be long now - this will be the song that plays as our coffin rolls down into the furnace.
Nothing left but an empire of dirt."

Tonie Mcfadden	Dad's song..
Mimi YuYu	"Rick Ruben is really who we should thank for this. He sent this song to Johnny on 2 occasions. After not getting any feedback the second time, Rick really pushed him to look at Hurt again. 

Trent’s version was about pain and regret- but in a 20 something year olds point of view. They had their whole life to figure it out. 

Johnny’s version is so painful to watch/listen to because it’s about a man- who is way past his prime - looking back at his life and feeling regret. It’s truly heartbreaking because he will never have a chance to change it. 

A few months after Johnny’s Hurt MV came out, his wife, June, passed away. A few months after that - Johnny followed her into the after life. 

Both versions are masterpieces."
Gunther Furlong	I just came across this Cash's version of 'Hurt' in 2022... wow.
Marcell Katona	It's shocking to know he was only 70 when this video was made. My parents are 78 years old and look younger and more energetic than him. I guess drinking, smoking and other drugs made him look so old. Poor guy, the whole video is just so sad.
Bob Surface	"He is recording this in the real Cash museum which was really out-of-business at the time, and his wife died a month later.
He then died himself a few months after that.

This came from the first Gold album he recorded for THIRTY YEARS.
Trent Reznor said, ""When I saw this video, I realised this isn't my song any more. It's his."""
michael southam	2:36, look at the sorrow in her eyes, It's heart breaking.
Roger Kiser	When we have more days behind than ahead, life has a whole new meaning… and the memories do sometimes hurt.
Hugh Barton	"Well, you could, theoretically, make this a final farewell to  singing, to playing guitat, to writing, to reading...but no!
Thank you so much, Mr. Cash.
You have looked at the edge(as we all must do), at all our hopes and fears and doubts, 
And you have, of course, stood tall.
Thank you."
Mac Linicks	This song makes me afraid to die, and reminds me to live every moment I'm alive. What if it's just black and nothingness when we die. I really hope theres some kind of afterlife or at least reincarnation.🙏🙏
MrMtm13	Nothing to see here. Just the best cover the world has ever heard.
Mrbirdmantoyoujk	RIP

ingie and Socks	He made this song his own . It reminded me when I took singing performance class. It doesn’t matter who sang it first but what message it conveyed and what it means to you and the feelings you project as you sing it.
David Rowan	Much better than  the original imo
Bite Me	Me to
Acy Banks	Prototype 2??!?
John Demars	He saved his best for last...
cameltube9429	Life fucking hurts . . . . . well done JC
Richard Redl	I can't watch this without crying. R.I.P. Johnny & June ❤️
Joseph Wyatt	I lost my father to cancer this year, and this song was a bonding experience for us, I enjoy led NIN but he didn’t so when I showed him this cover he sort of understood my music, that was years ago.
FL Man	This song is so powerful especially now that Johnny sang it. Thank you Trent.
Danuta Hanyga	"Really Johny Cash made into a song sung by an old man. ""what have I become"": who is this decrepit person?. You are someone else (old man), I am still right here - my former vibrant self that is still alive but in a body that's breaking down.."
Danuta Hanyga	"To describe this song and the execution of it by Johny Cash as exceptionally moving and beautiful would be a platitude. It just leaves you speechless and  I cannot find another word right now. I can see how the original author of Hurt, Trent Reznor would say ""it's not my song anymore"" Johny Cash added another level of depth and meaning to it. And I don't think it is regret either."
FILMinformer84	The only time in my life where I heard one powerful song for the first time twice.
Chekmate 99	a great piece of literature that is fantastically delivered- imagine having Johnny Cash singing this to you around a campfire…
patrick pellerin	Pauvre Johnny. La vie a été dur pour lui. Il a disparu à 71, mais on dirait qu`il avait 95 ans. Q`importe. Une bonne chanson.
James Townsend	Beautiful
dr siege	It's songs like this that makes it hard for me to connect to a lot of the vapid music out there today. So much raw emotion that cuts deep into your soul. Beautiful and deep.
Peggy-Sue	This song feels like having your neck squeezed so tight you cannot get air. It is equally beautiful and frightening.
Greg Davis	One of the most powerful touch songs videos I’ve ever seen. The man in black! What blew my mind was his record company just fired him before this video. Who the fuck fires Johnny Cash?!
Tony L	I wish it wasn't true.
LoungeAct	I love how he checks out to a cover
Mark Stemrich	Can anyone help me pls. i need help I have nobody left to talk to my gf was the last person and she left i have no family to turn to im so lost.

Magisterial Voyager	❤❤❤
Kevin Chastain	"There are many things I regret having done, the thing that helped me over come these regrets  is 
the fact that I have been able to help many people through my time here on earth this it has 
become my goal the older I get to help as many people as I can before my time has come."
js7un	I don't understand Cash's singing. He always seems to sing the wrong note at the end of a sentence.
Rusty Cox	"No other song so beautifully epitomizes Johnny's life as this one... in my mind's eyes, this has been a Johnny Cash song ever since its inception. 
No disrespect to NIN intended.... their version was epic indeed... but this path had already been trodden by the Man In Black ."
Matte Syl	"This original song is emencely powerful, but there is something that truely drives the regret and hurt home when sung by Johnny Cash near the end of his road. The fact that such an awesomely deep and emotional song could be covered by someone in such a way that it gains depth as well as meaning is beyond comprehension.  Even Trent Reznor had to admit that although he wrote ""hurt,"" in the end the song became Johnny's."
Sugonmaligma	Who else listened to the NIN Version of it?
Valon Aliu, The Valyrian	Fuck you New York
Sebastián Galvis Cadavid	I heard this song today, to see if I still feel...

Brett Northey	Wow
Frank Bernard	His curse was living as long as he did
Bryon Letterman	I've never been a NIN fan so Cash's version of this song was the first time that I heard it.  Ever since then the original NIN version sounds like a cheap copy
Tony	My pain led me to the truth and today I feel very satisfied
PenIsInLargeMentPills	"I want to be as respectful as possible but I really have to say this so it doesn't plague my mind.

Marc Dumont	It was a stroke of genius on Rick Rubin's part to convince Johnny to do this cover.
softest	Johnny cash is a legend. He will be missed😥😥
Charles Stepson	I think this is in my opinion, the greatest song/video ever recorded ! Johnny Cash really hit it out the park here ! RIP Johnny !
Nice Doppy	J. Cash take it from a hard metal ballad in dark deep way to transform it with Soul in a Country Ballad gospel that shines so powerful and reflexive in Wonderful Way!!  :)
Jean Vignes	What doesn't this video have a billion likes? It is one of the most profound works of art I have experienced, up there on the same plane as Guernica and Hamlet. The human condition in the raw, unexpurgated. Not a speck of cotton candy or fairy dust, yet all the more beautiful for its excruciating honesty.
GodVanDamme	My empire of dirt

Was he singing to June?"

carlson kearley	he lived a crazy good life and you can see so much pain in that old mans face
Dolly Dagger	What hurts me is how many people aren’t aware of the original version.  Cash is a national treasure.  He should not have covered this song.  Trent Reznor’s ORIGINAL should be in the Library of fucking Congress.
S K	Just amazing video. It's not just a music, it's like a when your close friend tells private story from his past...

Silver Load	Haunting!!!I’ve never seen any vid onYT with this many comments
anthhub	Sounds like Johnny was having a lot of regrets about what he was involved in.
TheCrewChief	I would have liked to have seen Trent Reznor reaction when he first heard Johnny Cash's cover of this song. Because I do understand that Trent Reznor did say when he heard Johnny Cash cover of his song, he felt like it was no longer his song anymore.
Paul Mchugh	Thank you x

Two Cents *	Chills all over!
Tom Jeffery	Fun fact: Johnny wrote this when his 13 year old girlfriend broke up with him in the 3rd grade.. many people confuse the lyrics with a story about life and death but many would be wrong.
James Clay	try Creep
Holy Woodsman	I was reading the Purpose Driven Life, to see that life is a test, a trust, temporary, meant to glorify God, and that we are deeply loved. What have I become? My sweetest friend, everyone I know goes away in the end. The sweet sadness of Johnny Cash regretting at a piano, can be contrasted with his arrival in heaven and into the company of the sweetest friend. He passed the test, endured the trust, and is glorious now. Was his life lived to the fullest? Yes, and he passed shortly after his wife, God is merciful and would not separate two halves of a soul for long. Life is only fleeting in our old age, as we look back and realize we are dust, mist and the breath of life, here today and gone tomorrow. Perhaps only those who intimately know the Lord see death as it really is, a graduation from this empire of dirt, but there is no denying the fact, that we all go away in the end.
CPU UK	What an amazing song to punctuate a distinguished career. Bravo sir, bravo.
Eric Giddings	You are someone else, I am still right here.  Everyone Ive known has also gone away, but not because of death, which makes it feel worse.
Team Bam Motorsport	the man the star the legend his best ever song we have so little time here use it well
Grant Floyd	My bro died a few weeks ago. This hits deep. He battled cancer for 3 years.
StashY	I want this song at my funeral
Nicolascensoriste	😢 magnifique
Ted Clemens	As far as I'm concerned, Johnny Cash lived to sing this song. A modern-day Ecclesiastes lament.
Lucifer	The nails version i never paid much attention to. But the man in Black nailed it! Broken hearts and promises start creeping up on us as we get older. One day they will dance on our graves!
kang goat farming	My favourite ❤️
Barry's RC Dump	My beloved wife passed away from cancer and I am an empty shell. I find it impossible to express my lack of feelings about anything, so I play this to anyone that asks.
Kris One	We watched this video in my Court Ordered alcohol and drug abuse program. The whole class was dead silent watching this video! And afterwards, nothing but silence in the classroom!
English новый метод изучения	He looks like the fish on his table😄😄😄
Brooklyn Smith	This is the best song ever
Nicole Henderson	Wow! Just watched NIN sing this, and boys does this hit right in the feels
Matthew Bourgoyne	He didn't cover this song for fortune and fame at all because he had all of that already , he's a legend but he covered it because it fit him so perfect and I'm glad he did because I hate the original but I love his version and people we can't let these great artists be forgotten about so don't ever feel stupid for playing some good ol'johnny cash or any of the old legends loud , I tell you what I don't care who likes them or not but I love playing their music as loud as I can and you should too
Ross Monger	Powerfull ending wow ,!!!!!  what a clip and song amazing 🎸🖤
jonathan	Song about man know hes will be died soon and reflextions hes life in song  beautifuls way to describers all life work
cryptobradley200	When the man in black does your song he can change your name to 6 inch nails. !!!  GLORY TO GOD. !!!
Ineluctable Smith	An over used old term applies. Heavy, very heavy.  Good for John for bringing this to us before his journey.
Clarke Knowles	He can sing but he can’t I would never make a music video again I’m sorry but like I’m sorry I know that you’re a little better but I I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I didn’t mean to be mean but like Kinda can’t sing😢😢😢😢😢😢
Ryan Ayres	Probably the only cover I prefer than the original by NIN… definitely about addiction this song 100%.
Michael Dunivan	Oh My !
Sarah Price	As much as Leona Lewis has the most beautiful voice she should never have touched this
Mr Smith	'....I would find a way.' Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. John 14:6
ronniebillhicks	chills, fuckin' everytme,...............no mastter my mood, or what's going on in my life, best cover ever. hands down.

ryan rankin	I have been alive and full of hate for so long. I pushed away so many in my life for such stupid little things. My brother for being gay. My Niece for being trans. My parents for their hypocrisy. I never learned how to love. Im alone and broken.
Père Bernardo	I'm starting a million miles away, and I'm keeping true to my self. It's hard, I'm trying to stay away, from the same old mistakes.
Ti-poil Qc	J’écris ce commentaire car je sais que je reviendrai a cette chanson un beau jour, comment tu vas, qui es tu devenu de quoi s tu l’air. Joues tu toujours de la guitare? Souviens toi que quand tu as écrit ce commentaire tu n’étais pas bien vieux. Profite en ça passe vite.
Russell Dixon	Thank you ........all i can say
50srefugee	But know  this, my friends: to hurt like this, you must LIVE. That, I think, is what Cash understood more deeply, perhaps, than Reznor did, which may be why this cover is the definitive recording.
An McCLO	"release your
peace hallowed
circled clones,
slowed mine

Pesky Pest	And you can have it all…my empire of dirt!
Aegis	That’s such powerful imagery: the idea of a man with more money than he knew what to do with, sitting at the end of a huge table with extravagant food and décor all around, but with all the chairs around his empty. Not another soul around, just an empire of dirt.
Brandon Brock	Johnny Cash's music will never die.
Jose Rodolfo Ramirez Esquivel	A perrito grimes
Ion Iacob	Beautiful and powerful. Rest Well In Peace Legend!!!🙏🙏🙏
Lorraine Niess	Love you Johnny and June!
Nick H.	Love ❤️
David Cohen	"It's been a long road John 
you will not know the time or place
but you will know this your Redemption has been granted
Congrations!
the slate has been wiped clean you earn it
who would have ever thought
go with God
September 12, 2003 (aged 71) the message you wanted and was waiting for"
David Harrison	funeral!!!!
Albert Beaney	This song is so brutally honest.
Miserable Defender	"Monday, 28 November 2022, 18:39 Moscow, Russia
  I am 21 years old.
  I have been in emotional shit for several years now and I hope that in the future I will be a happy person.
  I'll be back in the future and listen, me: a reminder if you suddenly forget or get lost: «Und der Haifisch, der hat Tränen» = Never Give Up = никогда не сдавайся"
Wayne Robertson	I can't add more. It's just perfect.
Rodney Henderson	This is my first time listening to this track and it hits me in a way I can't even explain OMG!!!!!
tashuntka	Yes....they do....And we don't miss them all 🤷‍♂️🌅
Даниил Таран	Увидел этот клип два года назад, зацепил где-то в сердце. И сейчас снова смотрю... И думаю, спустя годы снова вернусь к нему, а потом снова и снова, и так до самой старости. Уверен, что спустя долгие десятилетия я найду этот комментарий и вспомню этот момент, когда находился на Камчатке, впереди была неизвестность, всё с самого начала, снова...
Mike Faria	Viva Johnny Cash!
W B	That's the effing most bittersweet song and video I've ever seen in my life. Seeing him in his prime, smiling ear to ear on that train. Time is merciless.
Edgardo Rodriguez	It’s a amazing how a song can relate to you, this song was written about another man and his life but you can make it fit your life. I’ve been on dialysis for almost 7 years waiting for a kidney transplant. All this happened to me at 31 I am now 38 and I feel like everyone has gone away and I have nothing . The line that says the needle tears a whole the all familiar pain is talking about heroin use but I relate it to my dialysis because it involves needles and after so many years you become numb to the pain and you start feeling dead inside like a little piece of your soul dies every time you go in there . I know most people in here won’t understand what I’m talking about but if your going thru something similar stay strong and Think of better days so come 💪 🤗 ☀️
Jelly Waltzov	play this at my funeral
Waylon Shooter	"What have I become, my sweetest friend...

Such profound lyrics.  I feel this."
Graham Haller	Did he know, that when he made this video it would be his last song.  To take a song about drug addiction and change it into something else more meaningful.  The closing at the end is so much, thank you very much and good bye.
Santino Mendes TutoriArteS	Ouvindo com minha amiga Dani Netuna

Mexico Caravans	Not a country music or johnny cash fan, but I don't know how anyone human could fail to be emotionally affected by that song
Joao Prado	Simplesmente expendido!!
Nazenin	Both versions of this song are so beautiful and different imo. Original NIN version feels like a young man confessing his sins and shame but this one feels like a epilogue of someone’s life. Love both versions amazing song
HuNTeR Joao	🇧🇷 2022 🇧🇷
Stefano Poletti	❤️
Falkor ‌	🇺🇸🇺🇦❤🤍💙‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬💛
Jon Christian	Johnny Cash is with the Lord Jesus Christ in the Kingdom of Heaven. He's not missing a thing!!
James Dean	My step great grandfather is expected to pass away in a few hours, and he was a die-hard Johnny Cash fan, and played his songs on guitar all the time. Listening to this is breaking my heart, I love you Pop, even if I’ve only known you for a few years
Space Man	Johnny is a legend
Daniel Robinson	"Trent even said this was ""his song"""
bzntch323	Loved the song when NIN released it. And there could not have been a better artist to do a cover. Almost like the song was written for him. Legendary!

Albin Nilsson	"Lyrics for the fellow follow-along singers:
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Stevie B	This is a legend. The word gets thrown at any mediocre celebrity, when in fact they could sing, dance, or act a bit. This is what a genuine legend looks like. RIP Mr Cash.
Ron White	Probably the most powerful version of any song, any time.
Xristos Karagiorgos	R.I.P legend 💔
Jim John	Wow
Victor Ryan	Algum Br por aqui?
A C	I bet he comes back as a simple drop of rain.
Mica Drum	Quelle merveille
Darla Allen	Love u  dad i miss so ffuk mush
Paul Eastwood	This is a stunning song that is loaded with deep and emotional depth. As someone who deals with depression on a day-to-day basis, I can relate to the feelings that are conveyed in the lyrics of this song. It helps pick me up when I'm feeling down and depressed.
Little House in the Big Apple	The end where his life flashes before his eyes 😭😭😭
Zualtei Tweety	It broke me into tears listening this song and watching his life flash back, the sorrow, the guilt, the pain, everything he regret you can tell by the look in his eyes. But he is The only Gospel/country singer who is not such a bad ass looking and never be bothered about his outside looks, and i can honestly say the most beautiful soul i ever knew in an artist. He might have his flaws, but i respect everything he had done and his legacy of deep and meaningful and mesmerizing songs will never die. And you will always be the Man in Black in my heart. RIP sir,
arfermo	Realisation without Jesus , nothing matters in the end just a man of love dieing for you, but sometimes its to late to see
Ryan Peterson	I come back to this song whenever I need the comfort of not feeling alone. Like someone understands how I feel
MycenaeanGal	A lot of people trying to claim cash did it better? excuse me??? Mr Cash's version is wonderful but So is trent's.. Just cause you don't have the experience to relate to his doesn't mean you should discount it. It's both rude and ignorant.
Felix Caramutti	maybe the most emotional video in the history of music
Tuco Cat	The needle pokes a hole. Is referring to Trent reznors heroin use. And the explanation that everyone he actually knew. As he actually knew his friends. We're always going away at the end. Reference as they were dying.
omanj1	I saw this video in a checkout line in a Best Buy when it first came out and, luckily I was able to see the whole song play before I got to the register. I was blown away! This is the best cover song ever! I'm 64 and this song has so much meaning to me. It make me reflect on my life and want to do more before I go away in the end.
Nick P.	OG. PIR..👍👍🇺🇸
ruiner	"""I would keep myself. I would find a way"""
ruiner	This song means a lot more to me in my 30s than it did as a kid
Sashaa	RIP.
tino van der zwan phono cave!	hello Cathy! this was one of your dad's greatest it also mirrors my life I hope you will react to this! love tino!
Love, Anita Blue💙717  	🙏💙
Michael L Rakes	I swear to God, this is still the only thing that makes me cry every time I see it. Movies don't even do that to me, save maybe the final goodbye in Schindler's List. It's been how many years now since this came out? And I still weep like a baby by the end of it. I actually hate watching it for that reason but it's absolutely heartfelt and emotional.
EJ_ti	Im him without the voice. I regret everything
Wesley Feltner	Trent Rezner said after he heard cash's version of HURT ..it was Johnny's...not his anymore. I couldn't agree more. I believe this is how this song was meant to be sung.
Elkiwi197	when all these people in the comments listen to the original version it's gonna blow their minds
American Dream 6.28	Johnny cash

Patrick Nikolauk	"""If I could start again,  a million miles away, I would keep myself, I would find a way. ""  Johnny always did Johnny. June Carter was the love of his life. She died a few months after this video and Johnny followed months after that. After listening to the comments on this  video which is so powerfully sad , I missed any commentary of the last few lines and how important Johnny thought it was to 
""keep himself"". To thine own self be true. I love you Johnny."
Demon Kid	""" I know, but I am your monster no longer """
Louis Escamilla	jus got n2 johnny cash legend always
Mary M	I cry every time I listen to this song. I lost my brother to heroin, and I love this song so much even if it hurts my heart. Johnny made this one of my favorite songs to listen to when I hurt.
james fitzgerald	This is a song about a young herion addict written by Trent of Nine Inch Nails, it’s not about johnnys life, they made a great video.
Aimless Savant	Such is life. -Ned Kelly.
Niles sterner	I will never have a chance to meet cash but his music and beliefs made me the man I am today. He showed that the strongest men have their weaknesses. That sometimes all we need is help from those who love us. He exemplified fighting for the oppressed. Speaking for the voicless and being a messenger for change. Let his memory be a blessing to all. We can all do better.
don't trust my comments	Having family connections with Johnny himself makes this song so much harder
R S	This is huge
R. S.	I listen at night sitting at a small table in an empty room with a bottle and a loaded handgun under a single naked bulb….
Ramon Griebenow	I like the Version from johnny Cash and from nine inch nails. Both are so fantastic and  depressiv and so emotional.
lucinda corral	Rodger was in no way mean to me and he never hurt me
lucinda corral	So let's talk about the old couple that lived next door the one with the trains that I used to ride in the life size dinosaurs in the yard that I used to play on I believe it was in Buhl Idaho and in my trust are railroad and transportation and Aviation Trust where Johnny and Lillian it was a Johnny and Maggie was he married twice or were they just the same couple and I'm confused but in Idaho and Arkansas in Waldron Arkansas and then the guy that picked us up from the bus station and ended up dying in a car accident I think or maybe being shot I'm not sure but I remember him he was very nice and the old couples were the only ones that seemed to want to be nice to me
Marco Bruno	Fucking LEGEND!
Kiril Galabov	Great man ❤❤❤
The World Wide	Legend.
C	I forgot how great this cover version and video was. When they cut to June on the stairway looking over Johnny that broke me.
Dan Goldbach	It's November. The rain is falling right now as I listen to this. The cold takes the warmth of this away as it fades out. I listen to the rain and wonder if my life here mattered. I think it does. Hope is eternal. If there is a message here it is that you matter. This isn't a song of sorrow, but hope. Don't live your life wondering if you could've. Do it. Whatever your dream is. Do it and regret nothing
FJT	MAGA GANG MAGA GANG MAGA GANG 🇺🇸
Diane	I know these feelings like good friends. My first boyfriend passed away in 1981, at age 36, me in my 20's. My husband in 1984 when I was 30. My father took his own life in 2004 when he was 78 and I was 50. My mother in September 2012, when I was 58, my second husband passed away in 2010, before his birthday. All of this has had a profound effect on my life. It also proves that life is fragile, and many won't be around the rest of your life! Be kind!!!!!
Tnc874	i use to be a cutter.. i definitely related to this song
Jacob Seppala	I can feel his pain in the lyrics..
Om iyan	Everyones I know goes a way in the end

Carlos Eduardo	"Por isso eu sempre falo:
Viva cada momento intensamente, aproveite, tire muitas fotos, ria e divirta-se.
Nunca se sabe o dia de amanhã."

Fatt Kid Games	Look. Every stock drunk retards favorite song.
Anthony Lover	Such a touching melody
Jessica Klingenberg	"We were still alive.........,.....

Anthony	If this doesn't move you at least a little, you have no soul.
Louie Galvan	Great NIN cover
Matt McGuire	"You are someone else, I am still right here...

That hits hard. My brother was found dead two days ago and his wake is tomorrow. Lots of emotions pushing themselves through me lately. I hope he found the peace he's been searching for all this time."
Emerson Harrington	This seems like Johnny on a cliff looking down at his life the good and bad. His goodbye before he flys
Prof. Platypus	"“What have I become, my sweetest friend? Everyone I know goes away in the end. And you could have it all—my empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt.”
I cried listening to this and Social Distortion’s Ball & Chain (which I felt was telling my story) countless times at the tail end of my substance abuse. Nine years later, this video still evokes strong emotions."
Andy Maxx	Essa música mostra bem como é a nossa vida. Independente se tem uma vida de sucesso ou fracasso, tudo acaba um dia. Família. Amigos. Dinheiro. Poder. Fama. É uma reflexão, apenas aproveite e pare de reclamar. Viva e não seja um frustrado.
RideTheLightning	Way better than Nine Inch Nail's version.
Astin ackerman	Cried only cried listening this !
Mr. MiD	I've always wondered what Trent would think to someone as legendary as Johnny Cash covering his song.
Vulture vern juggalo	i would like to meet you if you dont mind sorry.V....
Steve Gant	I can't imagine what Trent Reznor thought when he heard Johnny Cash sing one of the greatest songs he wrote. It brings a tear to my eye, because when Johnny sings it, it seems even sadder! Absolute brilliance from two different generations, an absolute masterpiece!
Cynical2DD	Hate how people use this for shitty memes
robert 843	5 years later back again in this state of mind😢
Deirdre Morris	This is like a warning song.
Phaedra Widney	Watching June watch him..  such ❤️.  Bless
bryson badgett	but i remember everything what  have i become my sweatiest friend
Played like a spoon	The fact that he wants to start over so much makes me feel like I have to make the most out of my life so I don't regret anything when I'm old.
John Moss	Such a powerful piece of music 🎶. Johnny Cash was a legend and a very talented human being.  RIP J.C.C J.C. you will live on in your amazing music 🙏

Cooper Erickson	I’ve cut myself cause I was in so much pain. The blood and gashes didn’t worry me. I was at the hospital too and got upset ripped out my IV and my long sleeve shirt white, was covered in bloood cause the vein was still just spewing blood. Broken thoughts. The needles disappear. I get better and stronger please help me get better. I don’t like the way I’m living. . My friend Liz I hope she would listen to this and take me back. She is just throwing me out it feels like. Only girl I have had issues with. She makes fun of me. And now I’m without her. On the other hand I’m doing alot of video work and hanging with friends. I just kind of woke up and was like why? All we have been through. She thought my proposal was a joke. Even though we were having the time of our lives. 😢😮🎉
Guilherme 5	This song just make me cry, just thinking that my first love leave me and already find another dude…after 2 years of relationship….thanks for this song, hope I will hear it one last time

Cosmonauteable	"There are these very rare occasions where art, theme, and real life meet at the same place. This piece is one of them and it is beautiful.

Another piece I could recommend is The Shootist, with John Wayne. John Wayne is playing a character which is also ending his career battling with cancer. It was his last movie."
WTHD777	Please if someone can help; there's a painting of Jesus (3:00).  It's on the jacket of the original record. Any idea about the painter/artist, name of the painting?
Optic Devil	"If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
goldgecko4	"You CAN die from a broken heart.  Johnny died within a month of June passing away.  His heart just couldn't handle losing his soul mate.  

If you look it up, it's a somewhat common phenomenon.  Grief kills people, and when that grief is losing your only light in the world, it just makes sense."
Steve	My son. Is twenty five years old and he loves this song and I love the fact that he's a beautiful soul  oh John  this is surely a beautiful tribute to your life I'll wear your crown of thorns with humble sadness my sweetest beautiful friend xo Stephen 💜🥀🌈😇🦄🌹🌹🐸🌈🍀🎸🍀🎸🍀
Rock & Roll Resale	Really chokes you up. We owe Rick a lot for helping Johnny continue his calling and making his final decade on earth joyful. He bought so much joy to the world in his incredible career. He went out on top where he belonged.
RocketPoweredApe	Almost 2 decades later and I still miss the old dude. Rest in peace Johnny. To this day we love you.

Brutus Therwolsi	You being gone, Johnny, then again you are still touching many of us living. Though, being gone sucks? Misery and all. F.  No matter alive is better. Sorry for your mother, mine is gone too. And yet. Better miserable than not. For those of us still alive. What I don't get is the general gloom about life. We are all ash finally, but why not do with life while we are alive. No gloom.
Brutus Therwolsi	If I could one comment here, why are you so hurt, Johnny Cash?

ChavaGonzalez97	"I can thing on three things by listening this song and watching this video:
1. It amazes me that the author of this song and NIN vocalist, Trent Reznor admitted that ""this wasn't his song anymore""
2. Johnny knew his time was coming to an end, and that's why he recorded this song and make this video, as a way to say goodbye, at least that's how I see it
3. Johnny Cash is a legend, and legends never die"
Eric Somethingoranother	My favorite song sang perfectly by the perfect person. NIN version is really good too but his expression is perfect for it
John Tyner	all on this thread amen
bL1nk	эй ты, да-да ты - удачи тебе!
Gracelin Girl	Every one grows old.
Chancy Squire	Such a great artist. Such a great song. The whole life summed up in one. And the incomprehensible pain that a new beginning is infinitely attainable at the end. It hurts.
Roblowe Lowe	I’m going to look into him a lot after this song but this approach to this song gives the impression he has lots of regrets. He ruined relationships and in general was a bad person and now he nears the end is remorseful. I hate to admit I’m not well up on him as an artist despite being into all kinds of music, but he is unbelievable here vulnerable and passionate evidently with the comments to this song everyone relating to this in some way making people feel.
heatholder INC	Fucking tear jerker.  Hits me in the chest every fucking time. So much truth & soul being poured out . Chilling

Firstly,  I am very wary of any video that ,using edited images, the singer makes any type of allusions to being a Christ figure.I doubt that it was Jonny Cash's choice. There are no parallels in their lives, one ,if to be believed,  was nailed to a cross because He was espousing Heresy, died young. Cash was often a very unpleasant character to be around and displayed all the selfish self destructive behaviour of an addict. He was not hounded and murdered for his many misdemeanours. I like his music but I'll say it was the choice of the director. Cash had it pretty easy after he made it, and threw a lot away,and this is what the song is really about ""I'm selfish and if you are going to be around me I will hurt you"", and ,before you know it,your sitting alone, physically separate from your long suffering wife, full of regret and self loathing. Secondly,  the line, "" ...if I was born again,  a million miles away,  I would find myself,  I would find a way"", although not his lyric, is as deep as you will get in a song. You can never escape your destiny, what is now will always be, and, in the immortal words of Reggie Ledoux...."" ..Time is a flat circle....you'll do this again....."".Try being around selfish addicts and  you will indeed get very HURT. I don't feel much sympathy for him. Yes he performed for prisoners,  but so did the Cramps ,in a secure mental institution , if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it. More enjoyable than Cash's IMHO. Yes, this is an ok video, one of the best, well edited and does seem to connect with a lot of people emotionally. I do however prefer the official bandw NIN video's images displayed on a huge backdrop. It's Trents song and is more sparingly, searing and nasty and gets right down to the real point. Actually  I find this version rather cloying and clichéd. Don't put the crucifixion in your video mate, it's a bit Sixth form end of year project. Good song to learn on the guitar though. Nice easy chords, two barré if I remember correctly."
Casey Newberry	Pretty sure Trent Reznor from NIN wrote this, but still love Cash’s version better. And the video just hits right in the feels

In the meantime, I say, I'm to injured or unwell for the profession."

nesian 94	The me even a year ago is died. I walked throughout my gym like a god! Not an arrogant one, i always wanted to help but felt physically untouchable. I felt if i couldnt be hurt physically i couldnt be hurt emotionally. But i lost my unborn child on my birthday. I held her still body in my hands and couldnt bring myself to my feet. My girlfriend was shattered and so was my family. I held it together to bring some peace to everyone else but its killed me. Im one of the strongest humans i know, but i couldnt save her or protect my girlfriend. I feel less than human. Just venting in youtube comment section, hoping to disperse my thought of mind
มด แดง	เข้าใจพ่อใหญ่มันเป็นแบบนั้นแหละ
Jason Duke	"When June shows up, like a ghost over his shoulder...  that's the point I lose it.  💯😢

I've seen this thing 1000 times and I STILL can't get over that image!!!

Romanek is SOOO good at making images on film that stay with you for the rest of your life.  And in those 5 or 6 frames, he summed up Johnny and June better than any movie ever could have.

Its the best tribute to them that ever would have been!  💯

As great as Johhny IS...  as great of a song that Trent wrote...  as great a production that Rick Rubin put together...  Mark Romanek deserves EQUAL credit for sending Johhny off into the light in the GREASTEST way possible!!!  💯💯💯"

Falcrist	"Trent Reznor wrote this song from the perspective of a man hitting rock bottom and considering suicide. And it was a brutally honest expression of truth.
When Johnny Cash sang it, it was about an old man looking back at a life full of mistakes and regret. And it was a brutally honest expression of truth.
Each version of this song makes the other version *_MUCH_* more powerful."
Bryce Daugherty	I feel like he really needed a true friend in the end. I wish I could've made his pain go away. But he made choices and he knew he had to live with them. This song wasn't written by him but it is most definitely his.

melisssssaaaaa	One of the most powerful and poignant songs I've ever heard ( I know JC  didn't write it( - so moving especially when u know J Cash's life story.

Eternal	This song is spectacular. I’m only 15 but I relate to the lyrics so much and that makes me so emotional.

Thomas R.	Truly a real legend of music!
Ryan	"Johnny Cash's immortal cover of ""Hurt"" might be the most haunting song recorded in the annals of American music. Here we have a tired, frail old man, wracked by crippling health issues and painful life memories, wistfully reflecting on past mistakes and misdirections of which he well-knows the time to make amends for on this mortal coil is long past him. If this song doesn't move every fiber in one's being I sincerely must question your sentience!"

Renwoxing	I just thought of this, but I truly believe some songs ( like this one ) *NEED* to be ripped off and reproduced for foreign countries with other languages. I am sure that they could craft the same story in their language if they tried !
Renwoxing	"You are someone else but I am still right here , ( correct me if I am interpreting this wrong, but… is he not referring to his past self when he says : “you are someone else but I a, still right here ) 

Actually idc because that is how I want to interpret it because it is so beautiful and such a truism.

We none of us are the same people we once were, and yet here we still are…"
Grease Ball	Every time I listen to this song it hits harder and harder and I understand it more and more and I can relate to it more and more. I've lost a lot of loved ones in last 10 years after going a good 30 years with no one close to me dieing. Life is short live it to the fullest and cherish the one's you love. I've Hurt Sooo many people in my life because of drugs, but I've tried my hardest to make amends with all the ones I've Hurt and I've built back all my burnt bridges, but it took many many years to do, but it was worth it.

Time Painting	"Listening to this song for the umpteenth time, and the one lyric that never stuck out to me before hit me so hard... 
When he says, ""You are someone else... I am still right here."" 

It's such a profound thing for an absolute rockstar celebrity like Johnny Cash to sing. We all look at him and romanticize his life and consume it as art. But at the end of the day, we are who we are, I am just me and you are just you... and Johnny Cash was the only person who really knows what it was like to be Johnny Cash. We put on his music and turn it off when we're done. He can't turn it off. When everyone else has tuned out and moved on to listening to something else, he is still ""right here"" sitting in his life dealing with his problems, all the messy stuff that doesn't fit comfortably in the narrative of a rockstar celebrity."
Ezra MacMurray	I would never forget him
J Perk	The rare perfection of a song akin to poetry performed by an artist whose voice is pure emotion.  Thank you Mr. Cash, you'll be recognized as long as there is music...
Andy Cutright	June & Johnny. American royalty.
R C	"I'm speechless.

The way he says DIRT is destroying my whole body and mind.
It's like being vaporized by a meteorite (I guess).

You got me Johnny once again ;)"
M B	Truly one of the greatest gifted souls
PHILIP DUFFY	it brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it
Justin King	"Listening to this one song has made me full of regrets over and over again.  Then I remember my Father. The things he did and would do for his only son.  My father was a man's, man. He served to many years in jail and came out broken and scared. My young family at the time gave him a reason and purpose to be happy and proud. He became an amazing grandfather to my son, amazing father in law to my Wife and learned to love and care again.
It was the last 2 weeks of arguments with my Wife that made me realize what he did for me that helped ME GET HERE. 
He made me realize that love isn't to be scared of, selling drugs and trying to be a gangster wasn't my best interest and showed me I was wasting my life.
He pushed me to get a Real on the books job at 21 after not seeing me for 7 years after a arson job gine wrong. 

He saved my whole life from prison after a horrible night of me drinking and eating benzos. HE sacrificed his safety and mental stability to save me from the past he was given. 
He knew what, where and when.
Dad I miss you terribly and your guidance that's been instilled has gotten me so far.
Thank you for the visits and lectures as I fall asleep full of dark hidden secrets it's your voice that tells me not to worry, not to go visit or seek redemption from family's or victims.
It's Been you keeping me at home, husband and father to the life you helped me choose.
Brian King I can't tell you enough what you've done for me. Allyssa just brought up our last night drinking together when we threw that cripple fuck down the stairs.
I had to explain it wasn't an accident, we wanted a limp fool to break his hips easier to get him in that shopping cart and wheel him out to our pet cemetery.
Luckily she doesn't know that part. 
She just knows your girlfriend upstairs knew and called a ambulance before we found the plywood to jump on.

Rip Dad
Rip Johnny 
Rip to anyone that crossed paths with a upset young man that didn't know the difference between good, bad. Right, wrong 
I would promise that young man felt every bit of pain he's inflicted upon each and everyone of you."
Felyxx	This song has way too little views.
Dudek Fox	My brother died 4 days ago and he was only 68. This was one of his favourite songs he played. Rest in peace my beautiful  and caring brother.
Fungi Shroom	"Just remember ""nine inch nails in the original maker of this song"" all thought Johnny cash did an amazing cover"
Amy M Anderson	This is the one song that brakes me each time I hear it, every single time I end up sobbing, those lyrics cut me deeply and his voice and everything about this video tears me apart.
MJA6995	Amazing.  I grew up listening to Cash. Great cover of Nine Inch Nails from Downward Spiral

Roland Pradalier	A very old man with a young voice, so strange !

In all the distractions of modern day, and the expectations of society, family, and friends, I understand how easy it can be to get lost, to lose your way, to lose yourself. But it doesn't have to be, you CAN keep yourself, you can take care of yourself, you can remain faithful to yourself."

wheezysimpin	I'm a young bull but playin this makes me think about the murder and seeing the people I care about dying and shit just makes me wanna cry but the most sadiest thing about this is that no matter what u get tired of life the older you get as time goes on you just wonder what you are doing here and just walk a lonely path that's the  meaning I got from this song 😔😔
Cyrus	this is prehaps the most lonely song know to man
John Wu	"It hurts me so much than you thought. But I don't care anymore, cause everyone I know goes away in the end. "" You stay hell away from me you hear?""

Ryan Keefe	What I have become?

I’m sure Reznor was skeptical at first..but even he must have been proud when he saw it. Thanks JC. RIP."
Hans Kloss	appena vista puntata Colombo con Johnny... Sei un Re !
wrbl	deep
JediPhoenix1976	"The part where Cash is pouring the wine out of the glass is what always gets me. The lyrics, combined with (from my perception, anyway) the anger and anguish on his face....as if he's saying, ""Here. All this money, fame, and glory.  You want it?  Take it.  Take it!  See all the good it's done me now?  You want it? TAKE IT!"""
Mare	Poor man…😢
pwr rpw	This song has always been hard to listen too, but at the ripe old age of 55 and with each passing year it's getting harder & harder to listen to it,  and yet given how much of a train wreck my life has become, it gets more and more important to listen to it and heed its message with each & every passing day ! especially as with all people on earth we don't know just how many more days we have  left .
Motorcycle Matthew	Grand ole Opry didn't have Cash, and Cash pretty much Said fuck the oprey... like he needed it anyway. OPRY is a shame and a scam anyhow, much Metter country that lil Jimmy Dickins and pop artists selling out
Reality Gaming	Got me balling my eyes out…… why does this hit so hard at 26….
Arthur Henrique	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

I love Johnny Cash forever.

Also, this might be the best video editing ever"
Natalie Masulla	The person that put this video together deserves more commemoration. I think it’s just as moving as the lyrics.
Carlos Alfaro	Did someone notice that Hurt lyrics talks about a tired old man? Well, Reznor was twenty something when he wrote this. Please give some credit to such an intelligent writer

John Henke	Damn. Made me cry.
Vicky Land	Johnny crying gets me
Jay Reyndogz	Remain true to yourself and stick with God

GTR CHEVY	Nice
Rudy Bernal	I was talking to my friend about this song and something he said really stood out to me. When Trent sang this song it was still deep but not as powerful as Johnny singing it. Trent was young with his whole life ahead of him whereas Johnny was old and at the end of his life. It hits harder when he says everyone he knows goes away in the end
doc666ify	I am a big NIN fan but jonny cash version of this song has more meaning to me RIP.

Demoman(cer) [ZV] 🇷🇺	I like how it's not just a cover, but he also changed the text, turning song about going insane to song about feeling the death coming
EvoSuperSonic	"His last words were 
""I hear the train a-comin""
His song ring of fire was what made me interested in music
That is the first song I ever remember hearing. No other artist comes to mind other than Johnny Cash he will always be my favorite musical artist"
Astral	Johnny sold his soul to the music industry to become famous (was also a Freemason)... Sad. Guess this song/video was him telling us he never truly repented. The ending of it is telling. I hope he rests in peace, wherever he is.
Snowe Flakes	"Truly heartwarming song by the beautiful Johnny Cash.  I'm sure he didn't think that he was but that's the human reality of humility. So many reasons for humility.  Fart burp piss shit. We all feel this way about ourselves the human aspects of humility forcing us to remain forever humble and embarrassed about what we can't control. Humility. 
By the way you all are beautiful.
 Love y'all."

Rafinha Developer	"LETRA BR:
Eu me machuquei hoje
Pra ver se eu ainda sentia
Em toda a dor eu foquei
A única coisa realista

A agulha cunha um furo
A antiga e familiar sangria
Tento evitar tudo isso
Mas eu me lembro cada vírgula

O que eu ando me tornando
Meu mais querido amigo?
Todos os que eu conheço vão
Desaparecer para sempre

E você poderia ter igual
Meu Império de Lama
Eu vou deixá-lo frustrado
Eu vou fazer doer

Me coroo com este ramo de espinhos
No colo do meu trono de mentiras
Entupido de pensamentos corrompidos
Que jamais consertarei

Devido ao que o tempo manchar
Vai sumindo o que eu sinto
Você é um indivíduo à parte
Eu continuo aqui

O que eu ando me tornando
Meu mais querido amigo?
Todos os que eu conheço vão
Desaparecer para sempre

E você poderia ter igual
Meu Império de Lama
Eu vou deixá-lo frustrado
Eu vou fazer doer

Se eu começasse outra vez
A milhões de milhas daqui
Eu ainda seria o mesmo
Eu daria um jeito"

Timothy Archer	Bloody hell this was powerful the pain In both June and Johnnys eyes ❤
Attans	me and the boys in the final year of high school:
Andrea Palumbo	"I have never had a song resonate so accurately with a situation I'm going through. I've watched so many people come and go in my life, they come, they take, they leave me a hollow shell and curse my name when they leave.

I can't get through this song without weeping. God be with me."
Wally Zadelhoff	why you liive
Marie	Bad bad guy, but i hope he have gone to the most high .Bless you
F34R	Best cover of all times
Kaz Kazik	Human live
Yossi Arias	"I think it is the best cover version ever performed. Amazing, emotional, brilliant. Johnny cash at his best. 
knowing the tragedies happen just few months after this video clip was shot only enhance the experience."
Andrew Mueller	Johnny cash looked very sad in this video
Evan Jacobs	He had a great voice until the end
Revolution Underground	I'm feeling this today

McGannahan Skyjellyfetti	Everyone I know goes away In the end…
jennlam77	This song is full of many emotions. Hearing Johnny sing it towards the end of his life, has me pausing and reflecting. The part when June tilts her head and looks at him with loving eyes gets me every time ❤️❤️

Tribute to you, good sir.. 

Rest In Peace.."
Валерий	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Rainbow Glitter	Alas.....famous person syndrome.
Thomas Romeni	Although I'm not a die-hard Johnny Cash fan, I always like to remember Johnny Cash together with Peter Falk in the Columbo episode Swan Song. This song by him got under my skin when it was released in 2002, because in 2001 only my father died and a short time later my mother died. Rest in Peace, where everyone goes. Greetings from Germany.
Danielle Silipo	My god he speaks truth! 🙏🏼
vincenzo fiore	La tua voce mi toglie la tristezza dal cuore .
Matze Langer	Der größte aller Zeiten ❤️
Tintin Supz	"Hearing this song i remember some of my close relatives (paternal and maternal uncles etc who had passed away too soon due to addiction and it brings a great pain and a sense of caution! 
We can all learn from them, 
To not waste our short period of time on earth on toxic earthly pleasure but clean, sober and genuine love for our loved ones and put God first on everything.
Rest in peace Legend.. Your Song have saved and corrected many souls ❤"
autobot chiquito 👍	Charles el mundo....no es el mismo de antes
Russell David	God Bless American.  My heart goes out to everyone how just lost someone.  💔
James Westphal	Johnny Cash sucks...until he doesn't. Whiskey is disgusting...until it isn't. Certain things don't resonate with us until we get older and start failing in life.
Travis Gibson	This song is beautiful and gut-wrenching at the same time.
Bear Queen	This song is so very true for me
Danny Good	Shocking truth
Bondedwithpotatoes007	"Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age was meant to submit something for Cash to cover on this album, yet didn’t because he thought his songs were ‘too sad.’

When the album actually released and he heard this song in particular, he kicked himself for not sending anything."
ANTONIO ESCOBAR	Strong last message almost profethic. My empire of dirth. God may have mercy of us only dirt
swanvesta2882	and you could have it all, my empire of dirt...
Jordan	Cash was a REAL MAN ALL MASCULINITY even at 71. I can relate as can everyone else who survived addiction...🙏🙏🙏
Collin Cutler	God bless Johnny Cash
luisgus101	During that year I lost all my friends for believing in a girl who broke my trust, then I met a person who made me know what it's like to really love. We had such beautiful moments, and just when I thought I would come out of the darkness, she ends with me saying that she didn't feel the same way about me anymore because of my mistakes and problems. I just didn't give up on living because I don't want to give this weight to my parents, I'm an only child and I don't want to be a failure even for them.
Charles Boynton	GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY...I STILL MISS him, and the entire era of Cash. Getting old - totally understanding this.
karelatsea	Amazing grace. John is with our lord in heaven. Amen
Montana 	can't stop listening to ya cash
Antonio Hernandez	This will be here forever YouTube can't take this song down ,😭😭
Br Bart	Can't imagine the feeling you have when you know it's over and everything you have means almost nothing in comparison to the things you did, and you just wish you could've do more or do it differently... that feeling, I guess, you feel just before and you can see it in his eyes.
outoftyme	The world will never forget Johnny Cash
Donna Covello	I remember when this video and song came out. I can't believe it has been 20 years ago 💔.  I just saw this again and I began to cry. So much of my life feelings and emotions are a image of my life, even though I am a woman.  God bless Johnny
Andria M. Simpson-Russell	20 years ago this hit....Miss You Johnny.
Normal Guy	Just to be clear, I’m here because I like this song, not because somebody has died.

Live Vicariously Through Me	"Wow hard to believe it’s been 20 years This is a powerful song
 #nineinchnails did it in a time when my generation needed it #johnnycash did it when the world needed 
It’s amazing that a song can link a 71 year old & a 38 year olds generation as if it was the same generation"
Senior Vitalist	Myself wanna cry everytime I hear this song and see this video, thats an insane true work from a real good human, god bless you Johnny Cash,  all my life ive heard about you, never really care, this song shows the fucking legend you are without a doubt. I love you man, even if i dont know you, and big thanks to you, to make my heart see all the good around before its too late, thanks you a thousand time good old man.

Logan Hillman	20 years ago today this was recorded. 18th October 2002.
Brian Soundzen47	I've now been clean over 30 years and I work as a substance abuse counselor. This is perhaps one of the most powerful songs about the experience of an addict.  This video is a majestic work of art.  I met Johnny Cash back in 1990. He signed my guitar.  He was a humble, and beautiful soul. A true legend.  His music and legacy lives on forever in our hearts.  RIP 🙏  Johnny and June.  His beloved wife
Sancho_ Mask	Johnny Cash forever
Renzo BoatelliRenzoB	Great sound, one of the greatest artists.
ZooWeeMama	This is one of the songs you don't sing along to. Just, listen.
Jaclyn Wimmer	I think what he was portraying was he lived his whole life climbing that hill to get to the top and eventually he had it all; Money and fame.  but even in the end, even if you have it all, in the end we all die one day. With that comes a realization that the journey in life is what’s important. What we do with each day is important and if we have our soul ready with the lord to go into eternity because tomorrow is not promised.  We all have a journey some roads are rockier than others, but we are not defined by our choices. There is life and grace through the Lord Jesus who restores us and makes us new to start again each day. I wanted to write this comment incase someone is hurting today and needs to know Jesus loves you, just reach out your hand and he will be there to pick you up no matter what stage in life you are in
MegaSquadEricM	Rip 😥😥
James Lawson	I don't Enjoy Country music but A total respect for john
James Lawson	As much as I despise Country music except the Classic Ones, I totally Respect Jonnie CASH!
mreddiemush	"I can see my life in retrospect, the same way. Time just flies by. You could have it all, my empire of dirt. All your possessions mean nothing when the end comes. Enjoy your life today. Like Kenny Chesney says....:Don't blink. Life goes faster than you think.""."
PokeChris	Later in my life my mom told me that Johnny cash was related to me. My grandmothers mom was cousins with Johnny cashes mom. And I’m still pretty sad to this day that I didint get to meet him. However he made an impact on the world and might just be one of the greatest out there, love ya Cash❤
Larry Smith	"Same old tone echo alone
So loud bando 
Only feeling of home 
Deck of cards fall with one kiss
Full house we’re just kids
Empty stomics that was just what it is what it is
Quietly whispering 
One day 
It will be okay 
But oh how the thirst for middle class amenities are only ment for chosen society 
Back of dirty dumpsters discarded baloney 
Cold and lonely 
Yearning for company 
Warmth of another 
But all that have past my path
Have betrayed me 
Took every thing with a crooks smile 
Robbed me with thug mentality 
My biggest fear is the ones 
Who were truly friends 
I fucked over last time we were in the same presence 
Because presently homeless 
Doesn’t feel so hopeless 
Grab these train tracks ripping nails threw every obstacle 
Did I eat today fuck worry about that at a later date

Alone hobo Hilton 
Back ally late at night I feel the mosquitos watching me
Laughing threw there blood sucking theeth 
Living deadline week after week
I’m just dumpster diving for free
Bando boarded up for weeks
Cold no heat about a hundred bed sheets givin to me on the streets 
Life of hobo Hilton luxury 
Humble yourself when you throw out left over meat
Someone like me could be hungry 
Now hiring 
Interview and all they could see was hobo off the streets 
Man of defeat 
Torn socks on my feet 
Shirt washed in the creek
Embarrassed and weak 
Yellow teeth 
Forgive me it’s been a journey 
I’m sure it has been 
But it doesn’t stop at me
Hello do you understand do you need me to repeat 
No you already did
Concrete hot summer heat
Crossed my path 
But forgotten me 
I’m the one who revived you when you had no heart beat
I held your hand till the ambulance can 
This is how you treat me 
A crownless king with broken angle wings 
Good luck to you 
When you tuck in your sheets 
And caint breath 
Hanging 
It won’t be me
Same old tone echo alone
So loud bando 
Only feeling of home 
Deck of cards fall with one kiss
Full house we’re just kids
Empty stomics that was just what it is what it is
Quietly whispering 
One day 
It will be okay 
But oh how the thirst for middle class amenities are only ment for chosen society 
Back of dirty dumpsters discarded baloney

It won’t be me

It doesn’t matter to me 
Does it matter to you
Finish line living on the streets 
Feels more free 
Than an empty gas tank
The beginning of the week
What they must think
Doesn’t matter to me 
Does it matter to you
Would you stop and think 
That could be me
That use to be you
Or don’t even blink"
brian tiger	Sad song
Doogle Ticker	I'm gonna pass the bar soon (Navy for die), and I cannot express this and these emotions as well as this (timeless) work of art. Thank you Johnny Cash for this. It is a comfort to millions. God, how I loved you and your musicians since the Folsom Prison Blues LP. One of the 20th century's best musicians by far...love, man to man, and eternal respect, DT.

Angel Angelov	Why do we waste our lives on things that dont matter and realise it when its too late? Rest in Peace LEGEND
Tohellwith Google	"""Everyone I know goes away"" is so true. So many friends died from various reasons."
Living Tribunal	"Weak-ass Cash.

Man--up and grow a pair you Country-Hick-HOE"
Tonya Burroughs	I miss my dad so much. He dedicated this song to me several months before he passed away.
Bring Your Baby to the BBQ	Why do i gotta love all the musicians that ill never get to see live?
Jak Jones	I grew up in East Nashville and I remember as a youngster in my hood just trying to survive. One day I was in the hood and a White Cadillac with a White man pulled up. I remember that the Big Homie told us to not say anything to the guy as he waved for him to come here. I knew that the man wasn't a police and he had a chrome 357 tucked in his pants as he walked passed me. Well a few years later as I was driving through my city and seen a Billboard with a man holding a guitar. His face was so familiar. And then I recalled how I saw him in person. Then I realized, that man was Johnny Cash! I hated country music, until him.
EL guay guayareno	la música de este señor es sentimiento 😍😍😊😊🤘🤘

Music Snob	Hearing trent resner say that song now belongs to johnny cash. Its like it was his all along.
Lamont Bills	I can't say anything about the man in black but I feel his pain
bob brophy	One of the best covers/music videos, however whoever (Mark Romanek I believe) put the video together I don't think gets enough credit. All those clips of Johnny throughout his life changing with the rhythm of the song, absolutely unforgettable.
Blaqyscorpion's More Games More Wins	This week marks 5 yrs since I lost my 27yo wife !! My best friend for life ! And my dogoo love them both ! For life ! I promise  I will not fall again and I live for you both !
Jersey F	The best thing about Johnny he keeps living on. He thought he would be forgotten.  I listened to him all my life and still do. I’m 41 now and have 3 biological children. My youngest is 16. Even she listens to hurt. All my kids have heard this song. In these times it’s sweet when kids turn to Johnny verse some of the other music being put out there. She said, “He’s relatable and I can’t relate to my generation. They put out horrible music. So I listen to oldies and the 90’s. Some early 2000’s but that’s as far as it goes.” That’s actually sad and beautiful at the same time. We still have our youth today listening to older generations. He clearly lives on through them. So Johnny you will NEVER be forgotten. This is my favorite song. He’s a legend! ❤❤❤❤

jayakumaran sukumaran	I honoured to this song. For better coming generation for better life without drug and alcohol. Salute to Sir Cash.
Victor Romain	He was an American folk music icon. He was the absolute king of western and county/folk music: on an international scale. He was also a great lead actor in the classic movie (based on a true story) Murder in Coweta County (1983) cast as Sherif Potts. His contribution to the music and entertainment business shall be as timeless as it is legendary.
Un Poco De Todo	cool
Alaskan Style	Love you Johnny!
Oscar Garcia Miguel	Que genio. Además ha envejecido como un buen vino. Sus últimos discos son joyas musicales.
sebastian naranjo	Great cover for NIN
Kyle McRobert	"So monotone, this is literally one of the worst covers ever. Literally anyone's grandpa can sing better than this trash cover. 

It's like he's just talking over the chords, lol. Hot garbage."
Jamey Summers	"This is about as powerful as you can get. This became Johnnys song.
(3 Weeks later Edit)
 I just saw an interview with Trent Reznor. He actually did say that this song became Johnnys. He was afraid that it would be gimmicky or corny, but he was impressed after he heard it and he was moved and said that it became Johnnys song."
Sarah Ferguson	Wow. He was a huge part of my childhood and it's taken me decades to gather the courage to watch this. I wanted to remember him as i remembered him from my childhood. I think it's because he reminds me SO much of my father. I'm glad i finally watched it. It was beautiful and even in the end his voice was deep and soft and clear. I'm glad i finally watched it ❤️

John	Johnny Cash should have ended the song by singing I will find the way referencing Jesus who said I am the Way , the Truth and the Life.
Rodney Wolters	That is one very good song
jr10spro	Feel this song so much these days...
Nova 	I like Jonny's version a lot better than the original. You can really feel the emotion in this
Guy Michel	"The words are so 80's ironic, all that standard-for-the-era amateur misery poetry—it's hard to believe he would even consider singing them. It's obvious he's trying but knows that they are bullsh!t; but maybe he wanted to sing them cuz he felt like his life was kinda in other people's hands now? (Hell, why didn't Rubin mismanipulate him into doin, say, Eminem? Or ""Anarchy In the UK""?) Is Dylan getting there too? Is this what happens to all of us near the end? Probably.       Johnny Cash lives forever, period."

Coffer Martin	"Every time i hear this song, a rush of emotions and regrets overcome me. I first heard Trent Reznor's version way back in '94 and thought it was the most hard hitting song about heroin addiction. The lyrics are key here as they almost serve as an autobiographical purpose for Cash's melancholy, reflective version. It was fitting that Johnny Cash went away ""in the end"" on his own terms. RIP"

Bert Bealeale	he stubbed his toe
Vincent Mack	One of the most difficult forms of loss we are capable of feeling is to lose one’s sense of self. How do you mourn yourself? The mirror says you’re still right here. But the mirror doesn’t know that reflection isn’t yours. When you see someone you don’t recognize in that reflection, the yearning for familiarity tears you even further from yourself. You can either stay lost, or you can find the new you.

J. J	Caramba como procurei essa música
Nigel Canning	Yes he was a very good singer. 👍 I love his songs.
Monro	Haunting and deeply emotive. This is also a definitive example of how to make a cover song your own. Johnny Cash's producer Rick Rubin should get a massive amount of credit for persuading Cash to sing this song after Cash was initially doubtful about being able to do it. He knew Cash would make it unique to himself. Brilliant and I reckon over 170 million views at the time of writing  is testament to that brilliance!
Mattx28025	Makes me tear up each time I hear it, but I keep coming back. Masterful.

HuffDaddyP	"Omg so many people are have a pissing contest about this version and the original. Listen, I'm a HUGE NIN fan, and I love both this and and the original. They both have a completely unique approach in the song, as we all know. Let's give credit to both artists. Let's praise the fact that Cash recognized real when he heard Trent's original and most likely thought to himself: ""yes, that speaks to my core."" And, simultaneously, think from Trent's perspective when he heard the cover. Like he said: ""it was like someone kissing your girlfriend. It felt invasive."" Eventually, maybe Trent also felt like someone finally understood him too when stating it wasn't his song anymore. Maybe he was finally letting go of all the pain by the sheer recognition of a fellow legendary artist. NIN fans, we're better than this, it's still Trent's song in our hearts. Be glad other people can sing along with us. Music isn't easily defined in one depiction folks; let the song define what you want it to, and fucking stop fighting over who did it better. Just give credit to both of these legends for giving us an art we feel so passionate about. Just my 2 cents. 🤘"

222light Atoms	When you watch the movie walk the line. There is a fictional scene when a recording manager first tells young Johnny Cash he doesn't want to hear Gospel music because it doesn't sale, or save people. And if you had one song to sing before they put dirt over your body. That would be the song that saves people.  BUT THE TRUTH IS NO FAMOUS ARTIST SONGS SAVES PEOPLE.  Mr. Cash seems to be telling people that sin is bad and the Gospel does save people.

Evidence for Jesus Christ’s existence, crucifixion, and disappearance from the tomb (He rose from it):

The Lord Jesus Christ did exist, gathered disciples, and was crucified and went missing from the tomb. To argue about wether He was taken from the grave or rose from it, is an argument a skeptic can make. Because well if you disregard the eye witness testimony of the disciples and there willingness to die for Christ, and humans won’t die for something they know is a lie, when Peter is pinned upside down to that cross, he could have said that it was a fake, but He didn’t because it wasn’t, what care would he have about death in this world if he knew for a fact he had assurance of a life in another, Jesus Christ did rise from the tomb and is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Now the evidence for the Lord Jesus Christ’s existence really isn’t hard to find a multitude of non-Christian scholars and historians mention Him within 150 years after the time of His life. One such is Tacitus a Roman historian who reported on emperor nero’s decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed rome in 64 AD. Tacitus wrote:

“Nero fastened the guilt ... on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of ... Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome…”

In this Tacitus makes reference to not only Christians, but Christ calling Him Christus and confirming the Gospels going on to say that He suffered the extreme penalty (crucifixion) under the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilate, which like I said confirms the Gospels narrative. 
Another important source of evidence about Jesus and early Christianity can be found in the letters of Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan. Pliny was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. In one of his letters, dated around A.D. 112, he asks Trajan's advice about the appropriate way to conduct legal proceedings against those accused of being Christians. Pliny says that he needed to consult the emperor about this issue because a great multitude of every age, class, and sex stood accused of Christianity. At one point in his letter, Pliny relates some of the information he has learned about these Christians:
“They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food – but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.”

This passage provides a number of interesting insights into the beliefs and practices of early Christians. First, we see that Christians regularly met on a certain fixed day for worship. Second, their worship was directed to Christ, demonstrating that they firmly believed in His divinity. Furthermore, one scholar interprets Pliny's statement that hymns were sung to Christ, ""as to a god"", as a reference to the rather distinctive fact that, ""unlike other gods who were worshipped, Christ was a person who had lived on earth."" If this interpretation is correct, Pliny understood that Christians were worshipping an actual historical person as God! Of course, this agrees perfectly with the New Testament doctrine that Jesus was both God and man.

You may have heard of the scholar Flavius Josephus who mentioned James as being the brother of the Lord Jesus Christ, which matches what Paul said calling James “The Lord’s brother” and there is another document that Josephus may have written which goes:

“About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he ... wrought surprising feats.... He was the Christ. When Pilate ...condemned him to be crucified, those who had . . . come to love him did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared ... restored to life.... And the tribe of Christians ... has ... not disappeared.”

Now it’s up to debate wether this is the entirely original document of what Josephus wrote, or if a Christian had edited it. But regardless he wrote about the Lord Jesus Christ. Wether it was negative or positive like the possible document is. Anyways there are many other statements, documents, letters, and writings of all sorts from the ancient world talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and there is not one question if He was a real person or if He was crucified and went missing from the grave. That is clear as day, He is a real person, was crucified, and went missing from the grave. And He did rise from the grave. And for more evidence of the Lord Jesus Christ, there’s the Bible and you see there is no evidence the Bible is corrupted, a lie, created by the Roman government, folktale. It is the recount of the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, now wether you want to believe it is up to you. And what profit was there in spreading Christianity, All the early Christian suffered persecution, beatings, and were killed. Another Scholar reported that James the Lord’s Brother was thrown off a building and then stoned to death for spreading the Gospel in Jerusalem. These people went to great lengths even giving their own lives for the Adon Jesus the Christ.

Amen!!!"

I live in Chronic pain and suffering Physically, Mentally, And Emotionally Daily. I'm not worthy of my sons love And Forgiveness Nor God's. I can't forgive myself. I'm harder on myself than my son ever could be. I past my horrible life down to my son, his mental illness was caused by me. I've tried to make it up to him the last decade, he's now the age my mental illness reared it's ugly head, now he's going thru it. He has EVERY right to hate me. He's never going to see me as anything but how I was in my past. I make him hurt, I make God grieve And I hurt every single day. I deserve what I go thru and  I don't deserve to go to heaven. I've gone thru, go thru, will go thru and have caused the opposite of heaven

Paulinho B Correa	"#JohnnyCash - Hurt
Ferir
Eu me feri hoje
Para ver se eu ainda sinto
Eu me concentro na dor
A única coisa que é real

A agulha abre um buraco
A velha picada familiar
Tento eliminar tudo isso
Mas eu me lembro de tudo

O que eu me tornei
Minha mais doce amiga?
Todos que eu conheço
Vão embora no final

E você poderia ter isso tudo
Meu império de sujeira
Eu vou te decepcionar
Eu vou te ferir

Eu uso essa coroa de espinhos
Sobre meu trono de mentiras
Cheio de pensamentos quebrados
Que eu não posso consertar

Sob as manchas do tempo
Os sentimentos desaparecem
Você é outra pessoa
Eu ainda estou bem aqui

O que eu me tornei
Minha mais doce amiga?
Todos que eu conheço
Vão embora no final

E você poderia ter isso tudo
Meu império de sujeira
Eu vou te decepcionar
Eu vou te ferir

Se eu pudesse começar de novo
A um milhão de milhas daqui
Eu me preservaria
Eu encontraria uma saída"

Twinkin Park	"Johnny Cash - Hurt (Gay Parody (lyrics) 

I shit myself today 
It really fucking stinks 
Bitches ain't shit 
The only thing I need 
The penis tears my hole 
The old familiar feel 
Tried to suck it all away 
But I remember everything 

What have I become? 
My faggot friend 
Everyone I know 
Takes a dick 
In the ass 
And you could fuck my butt 
My empire of cum 
I will lay you down 
I will make you gay 

I wear this sexy thong 
Upon my pubic hear 
Fucking dirty thots 
I cannot resist 
Beneath the stains of jizz 
The feelings disappear 
You are such a bitch 
I am still a queer 

What have I become? 
My faggot friend 
Everyone I know 
Takes a dick 
In the ass 
And you could fuck my butt 
My empire of cum 
I will lay you down 
I will make you gay 

If I could cum again 
A million dicks I've sucked 
I would fuck myself 
I would find if I'm gay"
Katie O'B	You said you’d find a way. And now you’re here and now I am here. Where can you’ find a way’ to instead? Thanks
Katie O'B	He said he’d hurt me if I ever did this. Remember? Isn’t it in the song? And then you turn the program into a trinket box program. Even the trinkets are supposed to rise up and be eco-friendly, through self observation. That part is much better than watching TV. How can people really escape the variance?  I think that everything is worked out perfectly because impasse lives the trinkets were your idea. I applaud u for this.  I don’t know if it was part of your exposition but it’s just small eco-friendly household essentials. Some Beauty products are considered essential. I’m looking forward to free energy. And I hope you’re enjoying the trinkets production and that that it’s becoming better and better in terms of American labor standards with friendliness attributes because that will also lead to fewer workers and better automation. So just forget about it and enjoy your accomplishment

Johnny Darko	One of the realist song ever written.
Callum Anderson	This song is hitting differently for me right now. My dad was diagnosed with an advanced form of inoperable cancer a week ago today. All my life he was my biggest supporter, and gave me the security I needed to have the best upbringing I could have hoped for. I'm 33 next month, and feel like a huge burden to him. I've never really made anything of myself. I've always relied on him for everything, and now, it's all come crashing down just how much I don't know how in the name of God I'm going to go on without him.
ryely stomp	best to ever do it. also probably cannot find a greater love story especially from one mans standpoint.
Alejandro Sanchez	"If a man ever broke me down it would be him
It’s not easy to get in my head but this man

Jhonny cash you the 
MAN"
dabman	shit be slappin in x2
Benjamin Nelson	"The way i figure things we about to eat with chop dicks dine in style. China been operating under one male child to raise super army to get 6-7 zillion u.s. currency we owe. The heroin epedimic and scrap metal buy up added to fake coin shortage. We got little to no projectiles. Now they upped the child act to multiple children. Why you ask, to occupy. Armageddon is upon the dumbass racist people of America. They use Dr. John G. Trump office of Scientific Research and Discovery Alien Property and Artifact Office according to the Tesla files mind control and brainwashing to push school shootings to take guns away. China has the same shit. They lure us into false security. Book of Mormon proves that. Canada or under ground sitting elbow to elbow won't be comfortable. So when are you coming by with my children and drugs?  

Johnny Cash sung it well 'Ring of Fire' biblical. Boy named sue
Funny how that my momma's middle name. 
Family probably."

ize Katze	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Gambeeeno	Has anyone else noticed he's not playing the guitar? You can see the pain in his fingers.

Pedro De La Luna	I'm going to do this song  when I learn how to sing it without crying.  It's going to hurt.
Danny Blue	"Damn
Why did I shed a tear
Somebody else too?"
KygoDragon4	He cashed out 3 weeks after this song.
Ashlynn Thorne	Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he loves you more than the depths of eternity!!!! He is God in the flesh!!!! Jesus Christ died on a cross for your sins and rose from his grave on the third day for your salvation and resurrection!!!!  If you worship Jesus Christ and follow him then you will spend eternity in Heaven!!!! But if you reject Jesus Christ then you will spend eternity in Hell where you will be tormented and tortured forever unfortunately!!! Please give Jesus a chance!!!!
west20087	"Fame and Fortune. It could feel like you have it all you can build a mighty empire but at the end of the road it all turns to dirt.

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt



all  the  text 


I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

R.A.V.	Un artista de talla única, que me hizo gustar el género musical country, una joya de canción que nunca olvidaré y estará en mi retina y memoria 😥👍🏼
Hunter Mock	"You can replace ""needle"" with anything. The straw, the liquid, the paper, the glass etc. This song is about addiction and what it will do in the end, even to the rich and famous."
Tommi Raeko	What do you say
𝕮𝖆𝖕𝖎𝖙𝖆𝖑 𝕻𝖚𝖓𝖎𝖘𝖍𝖒𝖊𝖓𝖙	Damn this whole song is full of wisdom, emotion and heartbreak at the same time. It truly is amazing how humans can tell stories through music, our milestones, our suffering. Johnny Cash is someone I'll always come back to, no matter how my taste in music changes. He truly is timeless
Debbie Fulton	I just watched this video again. For about the 438th time. It still makes me cry like a baby. The Emotions in this song and video, grip you by the throat,  and it doesn't let go, until you're emotionally spent! Just Wow!

Rals Playz	we will remember this legend ❤❤❤
Cory	This is not his song ppl.  Hold it together now.  This is Nine Inch Nails song.  Take a deep breath and step back from that silly precipice.  I call it silly because I know real precipice. Both spiritual and physical.    25 ft will kill you unless you pass out like my grandfather who fell 3 stories onto ground you couldn't get a pik are into.  Lucky to survive.    TMI.

Jody Beard	My wife daddy passed away April 4th and he loved this song
Laural Bodin	This video makes me cry
Adesoji Alu	This song reminds us all that nothing satisfies our souls. Only Jesus saves us. The depraved soul doesn't want God at all. The grace to repent still comes from God. From the beginning to the end, a live lived without christ is worthless. What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul? This is a call to repentance for me that Repent and turn away from your sins Repent you, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. For it is appointed unto man to die once, after then, judgment, where will you spend your eternity? Ponder on this word. God bless you

Nuk	im here from popularmmos
Debbie Fulton	"I remember  exactly where I was when I heard Johnny Cash's version. I had heard NIN's version, and I really liked NIN's version,but Johnny Cash's version, was something ""extra."" I was running errands.  And had pulled into a parking place. I sat and listened to this. Gut wrenching song. Sang with more emotion, than any song I'd  heard in a long time. With tears pouring down my face. I knew it was Johnny Cash's last top song. I cried for all his suffering due to drugs, and lost loved ones. And For all of mine. I was a mess.  I was finally able to stop crying.  It grabbed me by the throat, and the heart. And squeezed every emotion out of me!  Hearing the finality of those words, with that emotion. Johnny Cash's version gets me every time."
Jillaine Witczak	Trent didnt know it at the time but he really wrote this for Johnny to sing to us as his most humble and somber goodbye.

Istvan Bartha	Mr Cash died in 2003  according to wikipedia...how is this possible???
Geoffrey Snyder	"Trent Reznor was quoted as saying ""This is no longer my song"" (Thanks to Johnny Cash) what a Testament! ❤🇺🇸"
Robin Johnson	"Johnny didn't ""steal the song. He heard it and got what Trent meant he reached out and got permission to do it his way . They were both happy with the result."
Patrick Link	"This is a great cover. I've Loved Johnny Cash since the first time I heard him and I distinctly remember . It was Ring of Fire and my mom explained to me that it was Johnny Cash. Anyway I have a problem with Rick Rubin using a man in pain, broken at the thought of losing his soulmate. I think he took advantage. I also believe he is a scumbag. Ask some of his early Def Jam artists. I e Beastie Boys, Public Enemy. He is a weasel which is even worse when you profess to be a Buddhist. I'd like to kick him in the balls for Johnny. I hope it was a cathartic experience for him but it was never more than a money-making venture to Rick    ""funky boss"" Reuben. Just this reporters opinion."
Martan	Johnny Cash muss nichts mehr beweisen. Danke Große. Du bist in meinem Herz.
Ivan	Ушёл на высокой ноте
Cat Palmer	I must have watched this video a hundred times now, and every time my heart breaks again. RIP Johnny, and June, and my sister who first played this song to me, and my Dad because I miss him.

Robert Lee	I was never a big Johnny Cash fan , but some of he’s songs resonate with me , although I did like Nine Inch Nails , Trent Reznor said that once he heard Johnnys Version of Hurt , it became his & he owned it , the one part of the song that in identify with is ( everyone I know gos away in the end ) I say that because as I grew older great friends started to move away starting their own lives & family,s as well as I did & as life went on I had a very bad breakup with my fiancé in 2003 back when I was 30 . Now at the age of 49 I run into old friends from time to time . I’ve looked up old girlfriends on Facebook & I have noticed that 85% of them are married . After my bad breakup in 2003 I never dated anyone again , now old & alone I have come to the realization that I will never find love again & will never have the happiness of marriage . I have come to the realization that I will die alone , but on a happy note I did make my mark in this world by bringing a daughter into this world over 25 years ago . Don’t ever past up a great opportunity in life & always fight for what you want in life , I lacked that skill in life & that my friends was my downfall & my fault , but as Gabriel signs my warning bell I will not leave this earth with any regrets I will leave in peace .
Patrick Murphy	“When Johnny Cash covers your song, it’s not your song anymore.”Trent Reznor
no one	There's not too many songs that hit me right in the bullseye, but this one did it for me... I'm always amazed the power music has on the soul.

JAMES DOWD	Let's give credit to JC's estate, his marketing team, his producers, the filmmakers of this video. Johnny Cash merely sang the words his producers put in front of him, this wasn't his swan song. This is a benefit of smart PR and execs, I'm not discounting JC's talent but this is marketing at it's best

Yasmine Bibiano	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Dee Matt	Cash closing the piano at the end... so iconic.
Bram Hepburn	those last 30 seconds are intense
Kamal Kishore	"Johnny Cash in the video is narrating a story of an old man who talks to his younger self. His circumstances  pushes him to become somebody else, someone who he hates throughout his life and has been helpless to change this. He says, ""What have I become my sweetest friend"" to his younger self showing a genuine repentance. At the end he wishes that if he could ever get a second chance he would start his life from zero, this time he would not succumb to his unfavorable circumstances and would strive to find a way to become the best version of himself. This last stanza depicts this notion
""If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"""

Thememelife	Chills
Steve Faulkner	This Was Truly Johnny Cash’s Story. What’s amazing about this song was Trent Reznor aka Nine Inch Nails originally wrote “Hurt” and when you watch the episode of Rick & Morty’s end of Season 2, we heard the original song of “Hurt” as well. According to Trent himself, he felt Johnny Cash’s version of “Hurt” was better than his and truly deserved to honor that song. When you hear both versions they truly make u cry, but when you hear Johnny’s, it’s more sad due to this being the very last recording he ever performed in 2003, because three months later his wife June Carter Cash passed away then three months after that Johnny passed away as well so it was truly a beautiful blessing that they stayed married that long together and people should always remember “Hurt” as their shine to their lives.

Obey Heart	Thank you Johnny for this great masterpiece its never too late to leave a message and this message of a former  sinner who got saved at very end is so powerful it moved me when I was a teen and now its one corner song I listen to restore my faith to Christ as my faith might wobble. It truly is a message and testimony for what this wise talented man found to be a meaning of this life and a only gate to eternity.
michael johnson	Always liked the man in black.. one of the all time best baratone voices. I also like Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.. the artist, writer of this deep hitting song. Who knew Johnny Cash could take a song by a brilliant artist and make it better, more meaningful & beautiful? HEAD LIKE A HOLE, BLACK AS YOUR SOUL, I'D RATHER DIE.. THAN GIVE YOU CONTROL. WOW! Just wow... love it!

EMstroop88	"Can't kill myself because I'm 5 months pregnant. 4 more months.

I'm a horrible person. I've physically and emotionally beat down every single person I've been in a relationship with. No matter how much I try to change and be a good person I always lose myself when the emotions come. It's not okay. It's not excusable. If I can't change and not be anything but pain and torment for the people I love It's better I leave. I'm so sorry i couldn't be better. God I'm so sorry I couldn't walk the path. I'm going where I deserve."

David Ewald Jones	By far the greatest music video that appeared on MTV. So real and poignant. It not only signaled the end of Johnny's life (June as well) but the end of MTV as a force that could be artistic. Farewell to an era.

Malcolm Siah-Wilson	I heard this so long ago, I’m 20 now and whenever I hear this it brings back so many memories, I went through a lot and this song always hits me in the right spot to make me cry and think of my family, I haven’t seen my siblings in a year almost and I lost my mom in 2018 and I never had my dad. Forever love this song
Sadie Scott	Who still loves the man in black
zx._a006	"I used to listen to this song without knowing the artist. Now I had just a movie talking about Johnny Cash and I was wondering who he is, I wasn't expecting this to be him. It's a great movie I recommend to you called ""walk the line""."
RavenArrowz	Johnny cash was a born again Christian and his lyrics basically talk about his path to salvation towards the end of his life. beautiful song.
: Daniel 3:23 [KJV]	"They tried to take everything from me and give it back if I bowed down and didn't do what I am doing now. Gatekeeper, watchman if the world and leader of the 12 tribes of Israel. WEDDING planner of the Lord Jesus Christ. Prince Azariah...

John Healy	This probably the greatest song ever written
John Healy	Drugs are death Think fools
Dakota Laettner	my papa loved johnny cash he passed away everytime i listen to this song it hits harder everytime i think about him its a bitter sweet good bye:(
castyorcer	My ex girlfriend showed me this song and we learned to play it together. We split up 3 months ago because we were fighting too much and could not handle the distance anymore. More than ever I realize that I still love her and wrote her a letter today - the first sign since we split up. Thanks to Jonny for this song which helps me through this difficult time.
Gerald Highsmith	💚 REST IN PEACE JOHNNY 💚 AND JUNE 💚 Y'ALL WILL BE FOREVER MISSED 💚
Kathy Deese	I loved him. His music 🎶 🎶 speaks to me still
TopGProducer	"Looking at the old footage in the video of Cash in his younger years. His prime, alongside his wife of so many years. Then seeing him as an older man, with all that collected wisdom and life experience. You can hear it in his soul. He knew his end was near, battling with a broken heart. 

I’m only in my mid- 20s but this song helps deal with thoughts of my mortality. Nobody’s invincible. If you’re young now you’re gonna be old one day, if you’re lucky enough. Death isn’t inevitable."
Dawn A. Young	There are so many wonderful vocal artists out there but Johnny always seemed to tell it like it is. No BS. This song resonates with me this deep connection I can’t really explain.
colliemac7	What a way to finish a brilliant career .. ❤️ I remember my dad saying at my age.. “All I do is got to funerals” 😢
Jordan blackbird	Fukin ceb played this once at the ranch and I never heard this song now when hear it I think about him
That Tired Guy	This song, it really captures the human condition
Ak W	One of his last performances,.,,, and a masterpiece!!!!!
Eric Sebena	It's been a long time since I watched this video (never gets old though) and I've never noticed the pain on June's face during her shots. Looks like she's barely keeping a steady breath. The amount of shaking in John's hands foretells of his immanent death too, and is equally as heartbreaking. I feel like I've never watched a high enough quality video to be able to see the details clearly. Was even harder to watch all these years later, but no less important.
nukose	Doesn't matter how many times I see this video, it makes me cry every time. Hits you right in the soul.
Stew G	I feel bad for the original artist. Cash sang it with his blessing and made it a million times better.
Mier1234	Is there a better ‘cover’ in the history of music? Even the original artist said it’s JC’s song now.

Kris Watson	Everyone goes away as his sweetest friend but he'd like me to not go away as that sweetest friend in the end of the lyrics. Weird song. I think that it's strange how I thought about how I killed Jesus again today cumming outside a girl who is about to stain her other with blood fir the first time.

Fachoneta	"Letra en español de la canción de Johnny Cash, Hurt (letra traducida)
Hoy me hago daño,
para ver si sigo sintiendo.
Me concentro en el dolor,
la única cosa que es real.
La aguja hace un agujero,
el viejo pinchazo de siempre.
Intento acabar con ello del todo,
pero me acuerdo de todo.

¿En qué me he convertido,
mi más dulce amigo?
Todas las personas que conozco,
al final se van.
Y podrías tenerlo todo,
mi imperio de basura.
Te decepcionaré,
te haré sufrir.

Llevo esta corona de espinas,
sobre mi trono de mentiroso.
Lleno de pensamientos rotos
que no puedo arreglar.
Bajo las manchas del tiempo,
los sentimientos desaparecen.
Tú eres otra persona,
yo todavía sigo estando aquí.

¿En qué me he convertido,
mi más dulce amigo?
Todas las personas que conozco,
al final se van.
Y podrías tenerlo todo,
mi imperio de basura.
Te decepcionaré,
te haré sufrir.

Si pudiera empezar de nuevo,
a millones de millas de aquí.
Me mantendría alejado del resto,
encontraría una manera.

Johnny Cash - Sufrimiento.

Para visualizar en 
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Adam Antal	u love u johny
Ronin Bhaal	So nice to see an authentic song, video and man. If this video was a book you would say it seeps from the page. Sincerity is a dying attribute in the world we live in. We are all alot poorer for it.

R COGBURN	Insert witty comment here...
Sal Difrancesca	Emotional is an understatement. This has me breaking down every time I hear it.Johnny was beyond a legend
New Generation Of Speech	true art
prissiecuevas1	The fact that this classic song did not win a Grammy Award is a travesty.
jose ccoñas	😢🥺
heidi engellenner	"Johnny Cash he tried to help with the huge mess tha Navy seals caused by not ringing the front door bell. ""you are someone else, I AM STILL RIGHT HERE"".. I have been almost in the same physcial location- with the exception of the move from my lincoln home to my citrus heights home and back to my lincoln home. I AM STILL RIGHT HERE.."

Franceeey	"bittersweet goodbye song. hurt. 
as the title says, it really hurts. here i am thingking about what to do with my life at 16 years of age. thingking about what i become as time passed by. in the future, what would i become? cause to be honest, i'm genuinely afraid. i think i should write a goodbye in this song. it's not all that bad. there are also the good times. the memories. people who made me genuinely happy. thank you to all of you. i can burst any moment. again, it's not all that bad. I just wanted to leave something behind. to the one who'll be reading this, enjoy every bit of the happy moments. i can't be truly happy. i'm trapped in this ""religious"" thing of mine. i can't escape. so to the ones who are lucky enough, live life to the fullest. thank you. thank you."

Caroline McIlwraith	This song has so many different connotations depending on which family member is listening to it. It's a masterpiece when performed by JC.
AJAE SHORTS	*When you relapse and the post nut clarity hits*
TechNMusic	"As a person that has done questionable things in the pursuit of self-gratification... this song always brings me back to baseline. If you are reading this, then you can have my empire of dirt. It looks great to others... but it's worthless and amounts to nothing when compared to achieving a life of real happiness.

You are your mistakes. Your are your failures. You are also your triumphs and successes. Just make sure that you aren't compromising what you really want in the end."
Tom Inman	This speaks to all generations of all backgrounds.  My take away...My soul is worth more than EVERYTHING this world offers. What's yours worth?
sWEaTy_sHOoTer	Just herd nine inch nails version while it wasn't complete dog shit nothing compares to Mr. Cash's version the only way to hear Hurt

Tommy Pitcher	I think he died of a broken heart. You’re the best Johnny! RIP!
R.W. Bottorff	Cash had an incredibly good sense of what constitutes a well crafted song, from years of honing his own songwriting to indulging his very diverse interest in other artists' work.   It didn't matter to him what genre it was, a good song was still a good song. A true artist to the end.

Crazy Cherokee	"Cayleigh (Ashlynn) L. Benson, you're gone but never forgotten. Rest in Paradise, babygirl. you're my best friend, and the only woman i've ever truly loved. if i could go back in time, i'd change so much, and i would've been there when you needed me most. i blamed you, when i should've blamed your mom and the drugs she pushed you to use. i should've stepped up and become the man you tried to get me to be. 

in life we make mistakes, but its not the mistakes that should change us, but the lessons we can learn from them. i've made many mistakes, and i've said many things i wish i could take back, but nothing hurts more than losing someone you knew you were going to spend your life with, and knowing you could've done so much more to prevent it. i know i need to find peace with myself, but somedays it feels like that's never going to happen. one day i may be able to wake up and be happy with the dreams i had, but until then every time i sleep it fills me with dread because it only reminds me of the mistakes i made."
William MacGregor	I fell in love with this girl, we had a fight and i started to hate her. The lyrics never hit so hard before

Darrin Clough	I like the Nine Inch Nails cover of this song, but it's not as moving as the original. 😏
El Zohanito	no1 ever disliked this song, thats hard <3
Mr. Self Destruct	As a Nine Inch Nails fan, I had no idea Hurt was covered by Johnny Cash, but his version of Hurt is so different and filled with emotion. It is a weird choice in the surface but I fully understand and admire him for this song.

OccultHorror	Rip old man. Drive those cattle until the man comes around.
Ed	Billy Graham talked about the brevity of life, that is what is so amazing and so heart-wrenching at the same time. Most of us are here under 80 years but the world has been here for 6 billion. I think about my dad and brother who have been in the ground since 1999. And now that same ground is seeing me growing old and I know It awaits me. The one thing about Johnny and being famous your life can live on for decades and even century but your body can't . And remember love is the most important thing.
No one	Even as someone who really isnt that old, this hits so fucking hard. Its like seeing a man say goodbye to his life.

Henry Rapoport	He transformed this song into something different than the nine inch nails song. There is something about him covering any song that makes it special. This cover makes me tear up everytime I see it.

Shak kahS	Guitar his voice way he presents his pain thru the song makes the energy of the art a experience that’s captivating  this song is definitely in my top 3 of all time
Andy Higgins	A song of just wisdom
Asofe17	Hard to believe that its a cover... This song at the same time makes you feel helpless and with hope at the same time. Like life is cruel, humans are cruel, wars, greed, anger. But at the same time we feel deep emotions, can be united through soul, no matter color, gender, nationality, sexuality and other meaningless things we focus so hard in daily life. We can just feel.
🕷️Don't^Mind^Me🕷️	Well why do you do that to me

LaborRevolution209	I love Johnny Cash. But lets tip our hats to Trent Reznor.. The song fits Johnny in life, but there is a reason Trent wrote it. I'm not gonna wait for Trent to pass, i want him to be appreciated.
ToFamousJay Official	Everytime I come back to this song my life gets worse and worse who would of knew this man’s legacy would continue after death to the point of where someone like me could come and listen to it and relate so much because at the end of the day it all does go away in the end but there’s hope until that point and to everyone reading this comment feeling down just know you could always make things better in the storm..👴🏻💵
Majora IG	"im trying to learn this on guitar. and i had the urge to look up, and i saw his flashbacks through life, saying he wish he could change it all. couldnt help but shed a tear. as alot of you know he turned towards God towards the end of his life and became saved. which is so awesome and it makes me so happy! but its sad seeing it at the same time because alot of the time, you hear them say, ""what was i doing"" ""what was i thinking"" and i see this whole song saying it. it truley is a beautiful piece that i cant help but shed a tear everytime
for poor johnny"
Ruben Aguilar	It was the saddest thing ever My papa loved this music And he died The last song that he ever listened to was Johnny Cash ring the fire
Martin Bösel	Bienenstich Kuchen 🥧
Psychotik Frenzy	I am so sad i couldnt see a concert of him...
Ethan Ellison	"I'll admit I heard the Nine inch Nails version of Hurt, honestly to me it sounded  like a little prepubescence shit thinking that the world is coming to an end for them. 

Where compared to Johnny Cash's Hurt, you feel the years of a long life's pain, the loss of friends, family, then we get to all the experiences that one goes through both the good and the bad. Then there's the feeling of tiredness, it grows with you as one ages, and keep feeling it constently.

Anyways I just wanted to say that Johnny Cash's ""HURT"" is the superior version, and in my mind the only one."
MARC DELENTE	Chanson crépusculaire du grand johnny cach une oeuvre absolut une chanson chefs d oeuvres dans son genre . Reposé en paix johnny et june .

Jordan Prichard	Not me over here crying my eyes out remembering how I found this song after both of their deaths 😭 I had the same reaction now that I had then.
Amazing Pop	*It’s crazy how many people in 2022 will return to listen this legendary song*
Predaking4ever	Trent Reznor of NiN (original artist) saw this and said it is now a Johnny Cash song.
Jeremy Shaw	This is the most powerful song in the history of mankind. Sorry Trent. This isn’t yours anymore. Why you wrote this song is just as important. But Johnny.. this is a reflection of a man’s entire life. Of my entire life. This song.. it’s not just a song. It’s not just music. It’d somebodies life. It’s my life. Ive left my family nothing but dirt. I’ve lived my life to the best I could, helping people, saving people. But I couldn’t save my own god*amn family. I couldn’t fix my own fking self. I’ve given them everything but left them nothing. Sh!t. This is deep. This isn’t normal.
Mark Behlert Jr	Legend. Absolute Patriot! Served his country in MANY ways.
Adrianto Johan	I listen to this song every night, and I admit I always cry alone every night. I lost my family too. I may not be able to see my wife and daughter again for a long time, because of my stupidity and all my lies. I'm a total jerk. I miss both of them badly all the time, really miss them so much. But I'm affraid to call them, I can't be repaired anymore. Maybe God had forgotten me, maybe He is sick at me. Maybe life is not as fun as it used to be. Damn i hate my life, maybe it should end it
vibratingstring	Cash can pull even more Trent Reznor from Trent's song than even Trent could. That's the thing about Cash. He leads the listener to places.

Divyanshu Minz	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

I was in tears when I first heard it as a 40+yo because of his personal journey (helped by the video); I was in tears listening to this after my father died; and I bawled like baby when my mother was diagnosed with cancer and I set this as her her tribute. William Shakespeare spoke through Johnny Cash."

El perro Acapulco	No no noooo, me quedo con la version original de Trent.
Slider	I really didn’t care for this song all that much when I was younger, but the older I get, it becomes so much more real to me. Johnny was truly one of the best to ever do it. This is the song that gets better the older you get. Reznor may have wrote it and performed it, but it’s Johnnys song.
spacefacegaming	This is a good song and the Kermit version  made it more depressing
Paul Cole	If this don't break your heart.    You r dead inside...... and I wouldn't approach any devil's in Georgia. You have no soul to sell.

These bible verses came to my mind after listening and watching this video."
Dillon Balbach	So beautiful his last song was about the truth! His last supper with the lord understanding his life was an empire of dirt! Being reborn again brings hurt as it reveals the truth leading to repentance and being “reborn again” some call it godly sorrow and revelation starts to break open. Enjoy singing in heaven love this song even more when I heard what it’s really about!

Randy Costa	"HOW PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE ADMINISTERED

1st choice: comfortable life (human contacts, fun, relationships, easy work)

2nd choice: remedy the one made by the first choice (all the opposite of the life of the first) 

3rd choice, etc.: no personality suitable to survive, probable life as a tramp (in the middle of the street), absolutely no human contact, fun, future, precious things, relationships. With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide. 

Procedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.     
Being as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a ""gift"" to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call ""paradise"", but once they verify that the element in question doesn't take the bait (because he’s not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.  
As a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.     
The second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined. 
In paradise a kind of personal ""circle"" is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it's all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.    
Of all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she's the most beautiful woman in the world.     
Their way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice. 

At the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear.
Not having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.       
On some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).     
Their followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves. 
Demons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more.
Hell consists of 9 levels. 
The souls of people who commit suicide are struck by the eyes little by little until they get their eyes ripped, a process that lasts years and they have to turn 15 turns before they can be saved."

Robert Andrus	"My story is not a pretty one, in fact it's more a story about scars than anything.  I do know the ending ..... 
   The making of a scar is not usually a pleasent expierence, however when reflected upon it can be a learning one. Scars show us (and remind us) of where we have been and the mistakes we have made. They come in all forms: physical, emotional, mental, spiritual.  I have a life of scars.  The scar on my chin came from a boot heel in a fight, the one under me eye from another fight. I have scars on my fingers from shooting a nail through my hand. The scar on my elbow is from when I was hit by a car. The scar on my knee comes from a motorcycle accident.  Scars like these teach us or remind of our folly, our foolishness. But there are other kinds of scars too, the ones u can't see. I have scars on my bones: two broken collar bones, a broken ankle and others.  You can't see them without an x-ray, but I know they are there.  What about the other kind of scars? I have lots those too. Scars caused by death of family,  it hurts when people close to us die. And the scar from the end of my marriage, it hurt when my marriage died. Scars from making bad choices that have horrible consequences .... an abortion, prison time, exile from family. These are the kind you can't see but they are there. 
    As I write this I am thinking of those who may read this, my scars are not unique; maybe we have some of the same wounds: death, divorce, accidents, sexual immorality ... all these leave us with hurts. How about anger, hate, bitterness, maybe not you; but these are all things that have left scars on my life.  I am working through these ... or trying to.
   I learned at a very young age that I was a sinner, and that I could not be good enough to get to heaven(Romans 3:23 ""for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God."") And I understood that only through Jesus could I get to heaven(John 14:6 ""I am the Way, the Truth, the Life no man comes to the Father but by me"") Until you accept those two things you are living with wounds and are creating new ones.  But once I understood that, I realized God was there for me, yet it took a long time for me to realize God is HERE for me. 
  I have learned in life everybody leaves.  I have also learned that only God stays. My parents? We  didn't speak for close to four years...they picked up my brother from college (we attended the same one) on my birthday and wouldn't come in and say Hi... My grandparents? They died: that is leaving with no possibility of coming back. My wife? Took off and never looked back. My church? My friends? When I went to prison they forgot about me, and when I got out they acted as if I was still not there. 
   Through all those things God was there, even though I didn't always see Him. Looking back I can see all the ways He protected me. Yet all those things left a mark, a scar. These are scars that are a reminder and can be a hindrance.  We have to learn to forgive and forget, so that those wounds can heal and turn into scars.  Because having a scar is much better than having an open wound. Jesus does that for us. He is a healer, he heals wounds and takes away our scars. He lived perfect. He alone made it through life without sin. Imagine that: no sin- so no scars.  Yet his body had plenty of physical scars: he was beaten, whipped, stabbed, nailed to a cross, and hung up for all to see. That could have left emotional scars yet he was able to say to God don't hold this against them because they don't know what they are doing.  This is the only part of my story that is any good. You see I know who Jesus is, I know he died to save me, and I know he is healing my scars. So I guess that is my testimony: Jesus heals scars.
   I have had many highs and lows. I have questioned my faith.  I have asked many questions, and to be brutally honest not gotten many answers.  Some of these ... is pain all I have to look forward to? Why would God not give me the desire of my heart? Have I lost my salvation? Does God truly pay attention to me? Do Christians ask these questions? I have at times questioned my continued existence.  
   So with that in mind, here is my continuing story: God is still here.  God is still patient. God is still the Great healer.  He still loves me(and you). He doesn't force us to choose holiness, he allows us to. God provides comfort.  Sometimes in small ways, sometimes in strange ways, sometimes in huge cannot be denied ways, but he always provides.  I have seen God work in so many lives. 
   In the past year the nature of my prayers has changed.  I ask not for myself, but for his glory to be evident.  God has answered. My faith not only has survived the questions but has deepened.  I am no longer focused so much on what could have been, but more on what is and can be. I am more able to see the storm for what it is: just wind, rain, thunder and lightning. 
   God is still protecting me. He has allowed me a peek into the possibilities of the future, and get this He is still there! Still healing hurts and scars.  God is faithful even when I am not.  
   In my struggle with depression God brought into my life a Christian, who is still basking in the newness of his love.  I am blessed! He brought people into my life with questions similar to mine, who looked to me for answers.  (How can one stay depressed when helping others?) In the search to accurately answer their questions of salvation and eternal life I forgot my own trouble; and my faith increased.  
   He has put into my life people who ask me about my week, and wait for my answer! I am so grateful.  He has also provided me with ample motivation to continue my existence by showing me the devastation of choosing death.  And seeing my son look at me with those trusting eyes keeps me going.  God anticipates my needs.  
  I have struggled. God has not.  I am so waiting for the next page.  God has used this last year to strengthen my relationship with him, providing only the answers that I truly needed.  Allowing me to trust him. I am not sure if it's in preparation for the next trial, or so that I will appreciate his next blessing more.  Either way it is with anticipation (not anxiety) I am looking forward to the next page.  Because this I know: God is HERE, and he is not leaving...."

July Chic	💞💞💞
Eric Adams	Nine Inch Nails is one of my favorite bands and most people forget that Trent Reznor wrote this. That said, this is probably the greatest cover of all-time. Reznor was very honored to have Cash perform it, and said immediately after that it “Wasn’t really my song anymore.”
Creepy309	every time i hear this song...im crying
Ricardo Arjona	It is impossible for me not to listen to this song and not remember the legendary eddy guerrero
Markus Aurelius	Damn... this is too sad. :(
charlie kowalski	If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself , I would find a way…. I’ve heard this song many times now but today where I’ve took my life, nin/Johnny cash, I understand. I’m only 35 but being at the end and realizing this has to be so heart breaking, I have to look at this positively and realize I still might have some time left in the hourglass. Most beautiful song ever written, thank you Trent.

Carl Dickerman	Cash was a man of hurt the takers and the users are just a piece of this

Guilherme Henrique	Isso é um hino do cash
Erik Leirmo	Honestly bone chilling good probably what Trent was trying to do but Johnny smoked this and made it mean so much more
Angela Picraux	"Hey I'm going to make a pan of brownies as soon as I get my motor home and I'm going to do it somewhere down there you guys got to come over and enjoy it with me and then I'll have a great company they'd probably make a zing zing line out of us though they call us fighting because we can't make up our mind on which way the song should go
When we find our way home or would we only find our way in between the lines would we ever be able to skip the rock or would it only just be our brain we tried to toss after our heart cuz the heart always plays this as a fool don't feel nothing for no One it just beats the blood but you don't turn blue the poor blue ones they deserve so much more so in the ghostly world were screwed and the salad world gravity is the only thing that can save us in pull us back through
YouTube who knew we uncircles all these videos that ain't and just get this one where it's words they can understand does a great dance off concert whatever happened to y'all doing the dance offs
Them old fogies and that's how it should be respect and honor and brownie activity

Kasey McCormick	Loved Johnny cash he was the best singer ever RIP Johnny n June
DirtyDeeds4Free	Its amazing that 9 inch nails can make a song about drug addiction and the struggles of being young...

Lars Rau	Trent Reznor (Original Songwriter of this Masterpiece): He (Johnny Cash) made this song his own.

Jsshhshsh Shshbsns	It was good to know this song before dead. See you all on the other side.
Ybarra Houston	When you listen to the DAILY AUDIO BIBLE APP the last 15 minutes are people suffering but trusting God  or praising God for something but very humbling.
Abbas Ghiasi	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Maria Shaw	When words and tunes resonates.. 💕

Jamjarr	So powerful
Mister Chills	Mad respect and R.I.P. to the Man in Black.  There will never be another.
PurpleAlleyCat	Great version of this song. I like it better than Trent Reznor and nine-inch nails.
Ella Gallows	Its funny how Johnny didn't want to sing Reznor's song at first because it seemed so different from his work.  and voilà🙌, we have two men that give two different meanings to one song.  And it is divine and breathtaking. 🤝👌🧡
مقتني Moqtani I	"كنت أتمنى لو كنت مسلما لدعوت لك بالرحمة .. تعاطفت كثيرا مع مشاعره الجياشة والتي صبها في قالب من الكلمات المؤثرة والمعبرة بصدق

Ralph Taylor	What a way to go for such a special saint
Alan Robles	Best video of all time
Dr. Doom	“You could have it all, my empire of dirt.  I will let you down. I will make you hurt.”  I’m sure I’m not the only one who can relate to this.
Isabelle Dubé	Cette chanson me touche tellement, jme reconnais ds cette chanson❤️ cest la meilleure reprise de tout les temps. La version original de Trent reste que cest la meilleur mais Cash a saisi l'essence de cette chanson❤️
MATbIGA KTO?	+rep
Joseph Brennan	"One thing one must remember about Johnny Cash, he was a Southern man to the bone, and that meant he was a Christian. He obviously knew he was dying while filming this video, and he made a very Christian reference in it. It was subtle, because most people nowadays don’t know the Bible. But in the video, when he poured the wine upon the the table, it was a reference to 2 Timothy 4:6.7  

For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.
I have fought the good food fight, I have finished the the race, I have kept the faith.

Bless you, Mr Cash"

Smokey	I'm a big JC fan but this song sucked then and still sucks.
Robert Mitchell	Brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. He really loved her she saved his life. We owe a lot to the great June Carter.
trkrln	what an extraordinary man

Ionut Moisa	I leave this comment here, sa that each time someone will reply I will listen it again!
Arr Ioph	"That's what Bill Williamson talked about. (ost ""Rampage 2009"")"
Jason Palacios	What I don't understand is that why was Johnny Cash so influential? What did he do or say that people like about him?
MisterMandarr	You don't know what this kind of hurt feels like. You may think you know, but pray to whatever god you believe in you don't because you will never come back from it. Only the hands of time will free you from it.
David Spiwak	Everyone goes away in the end.
sal cervantes	Rip
Салли Смитсон	Legend! Thank you Johnny. Это прощание
CPP	"The original version of Hurt: 
About a younger man who is deeply depressed and is addicted to drugs

Johnny Cash’s version of Hurt: 
About an old man facing his mortality and saying goodbye."
SCARFACE	Thank you Johnny.
Karen	He's right.  At some point,  we all realise that it is up to us to find a way to heal ourselves, noone can do it for us,  although it might seem for a while that they can or they have,  until they leave us,  which they will, but then maybe they don't.
The Iron Fox	He is saying good bye here.
spitfire7991	I agree Carter Henry. But remember the best music I've heard my time. Which is some time. I've learnt artist have to have sufferd in some way. Mainly addiction and mental health. Which go hand in hand. For example could this have been wrote if he hadn't just lost is wife.
Caim	nine inch nails brought me here
giulio7288	Bellissima questa canzone!

I understand life is drama and drama is life
我的朋友所有認識我的人到最後一個個離我遠去
My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end
如果能從來過I could start again
你想變成什麼樣子What have you become
我專注在愛的國度裡I focus Love on My empire

Jeffro	I've never experienced the sting he talks about.  Carefuly now days.  China is flooding our country with fentanyl!
Ray Galles	Whenever I eat at a Waffle House, I put money in the jukebox.  Hurt plus Pancho and Lefty every time.  Hurt is a song of life's basic truth.

Dawn Lapka	I love this song, and I am grateful for this video. I am grateful for it as a Karoake song. This video would be so beautiful and moving behind a person who can sing it even if they cried the whole way through singing it. Johnny Cash made beautiful music and had a good soul. So did his wife and kids. They are the people who helped to build the Southern Part of the United States during rough times.

มด แดง	ถูกต้องแน่นอนพ่อใหญ่เพราะผู้นำองค์กรที่เคลื่อนไหวอยู่ในอิสราเอลหลายกลุ่มก็เริ่มส่งสัญญาณอยากจะเจรจาเราก็รู้ด้วยกันทุกคนเรื่องแบบนี้เรายอมผ่อนปรนเงื่อนไขแก้ไขกฎหมายชุมชนดีกว่าเราปล่อยให้ชุมชนกลายเป็นแหล่งซ่องสุมโจรผู้ร้ายเนื่องด้วยการพัฒนาที่ตามกันไม่ทัน
มด แดง	เรื่องประเทศพม่านี่แหละพ่อใหญ่ร้อนมากเรื่องนี้ไม่ดีเราอาจไม่ติดไฟได้
มด แดง	ฉันไม่มีเงินในตอนนี้พ่อใหญ่ลำบากมากอุปกรณ์เครื่องมือฉันก็เสียหายยังมีงานอีกชิ้นที่ฉันต้องรีบทำแต่เป็นงานที่เสี่ยงอันตรายมากมันเป็นเรื่องในประเทศพม่านั่นแหละพ่อใหญ่
ruudd1001	Nice tutorial. I have been having content issues with my hmdi connected speaker and subwoofer. No soft is coming through, still coming out of
มด แดง	วันไหนที่แนวคิดทางการเมืองของพรรคคอมมิวนิสต์จีนเป็นที่ชื่นชอบของชาวไต้หวันวันนั้นนั่นแหละที่คุณจะขยันฟ้า
มด แดง	ถ้าเป็นพ่อใหญ่จะทำไหมไม่ทำดีกว่าถ้าเราแก้ปัญหานี้ไม่ได้เราก็ไม่ควรที่จะส่งใครไปตายโดยเด็ดขาด
mish roeder	I can't watch this without crying. He had such a complex and beautiful existence! Miss you Johnny and June!

มด แดง	ถ้าเขาจะโจมตีส่วนลึกของประเทศรัสเซียน่านฟ้ารัสเซียนี่เปิดกระจุย
มด แดง	ฉันคิดว่าระบบ s300 s400 ของรถเสียไม่ใช่ภัยคุกคามกำลังทางอากาศของยูเครนเพราะผู้สร้างผู้ออกแบบผู้พัฒนาส่วนมากก็เป็นคนยูเครนรัสเซียทั้งนั้น
มด แดง	คือรัสเซียส่งทหารเข้าเข้ามาในแนวหน้าการต่อสู้จะพบอุปสรรคที่ยุ่งยากการส่งกำลังบำรุงการสนับสนุนทางอากาศซึ่งแพ้เทคโนโลยีความแม่นยำสูงตะวันตกมอบให้กองทัพยุโรปซึ่งบินมาตกคลังแสงยุทโธปกรณ์โดนทำลายยางยนต์ภาคพื้นดินโดนโจมตีเสียหาย
มด แดง	ดีก็ปล่อยให้มีผู้เสียชีวิตบาดเจ็บคือความหวังของทหารรัสเซียในแนวหน้าริบหรี่ลงทุกวันร่างทรงพลังบำรุงก็ลำบากการสนับสนุนทางอากาศไม่ต้องพูดถึงก็สูญเสียเครื่องบินเฮลิคอปเตอร์ไปเป็นจำนวนมาก
มด แดง	พ่อใหญ่ก็น่าจะช่วยได้ก็คนรู้จักกันทั้งนั้นน่าจะส่งนายทหารที่มีความสัมพันธ์อันดีกับกลุ่มนายทหารรัสเซียอาจจะเป็นนายทหารนอกราชการก็ได้พ่อใหญ่จะไม่ต้องรับผิดชอบเพราะมันเป็นเรื่องส่วนตัวของเขาเป็นการไหว้วานเขาอยู่นอกราชการ
มด แดง	ทหารอยู่ในสนามรบใต้อย่างมีเกียรติด้วยความสมัครใจที่จะไปรบเพื่อชาติแต่ประชาชนเป็นผู้ที่ไม่ได้กล่าวคำปฏิญาณเป็นผู้ที่ได้รับผลกระทบจากสงครามถ้าคุณเล่นจุดอ่อนไหวชาติตะวันตกเขาอาจจะเร่งปฏิบัติการให้มันกระชับชัดเจนขึ้นฝ่ายรัสเซียอาจจะเสียหายมากกว่านี้
มด แดง	เอาแค่พ่อใหญ่ก็ไม่เอาด้วยโอ้ยมันจะเล่นไปถึงไหนผู้บ่าวกับมึงกูเจ๊งแน่นอนใช่ใครก็คิดอย่างนี้คาซัคสถานก็คิดอย่างนี้แล้วอีกหลายคนก็คิดอย่างนี้บางคนอาจจะไม่ส่งเสียงพูดแต่ในใจรอจังหวะดีๆ
Harold Gifford	👍
มด แดง	คือเราเลี้ยวมันหนักเรายอมเจ็บตัวดีกว่าโดนเขาคว่ำปากมันจะมีการเพิ่มเติมสภาวะเศรษฐกิจปล่อยให้เขาทำไปจะสร้างอนุสาวรีย์จะทำกิจกรรมอะไรหลังจากนั้น
Adel	2022 anyone?
มด แดง	ปัญหาก็คือว่าทำไมรัฐบาลรัสเซียถึงปล่อยข่าวการโจรกรรมเครื่องบินรัสเซีย
Numatic King	It was a song to let everyone know he was dying.
มด แดง	เครื่องบิน av8 มันเหมาะกองทัพประเทศยูเครน
Tasha Velcome	Yes being old is a heavy burden
Mr. snubb	I love that the song is focused mostly on his voice and not the background music
Sidtheviciouscritic	This is hurts even more knowing he’s sneaking the truth with every word and knowing he would die shortly after his death. I can’t stop crying whenever I hear this Johnny Cash classic
Fredzel Lomin	💗💗💗
Aemilious	you cannot cheat death no matter how you lie to yourself that you're a good person you eventually have to face the Lord if there's any so be truly good.

Mortis	"""I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"""

มด แดง	คือสัญญาก็คือสัญญามันเป็นเรื่องของศักดิ์ศรีสัจจะที่ลั่นวาจาเป็นลายลักษณ์อักษรมีการเซ็นกันต่อหน้าสักขีพยานหลายคนมันเป็นเรื่องที่ไม่สามารถรับรู้ได้มันเป็นการลบหลู่เกลียดของผู้อื่น
มด แดง	ก่อนที่จะยิงท่าเรือสินค้าของยูเครนท่านไม่ได้อ่านรายละเอียดสัญญาที่ท่านไปเซ็นไว้กับเขาเหรอ
มด แดง	คือประธานาธิบดีปูตินไม่ค่อยสนใจรับฟังที่ปรึกษาแกมีความรู้เรื่องการต่างประเทศไม่มากแกไปผิดคำพูดกับเขาเขาเป็นสมาชิกองค์กรนาโต้ยุโรปเขาก็ต้องปรึกษาองค์กรองค์กรแนะนำให้เป็นหลักปฏิบัติพอเขาเห็นว่าจะเสียเปรียบเขาก็ขอมาแก้สัญญากลับมา
มด แดง	ถ้าพ่อใหญ่ขึ้นแถวบนสุดแสดงว่าผมพูดถูกต้องประธานาธิบดีสูญเสียอำนาจไปเป็นจำนวนมากทุกวันนี้ต้องรับฟังแม่ทัพนายกองที่ปรึกษาทำไม่ได้คือทำไม่ได้สงครามยูเครนเขาตัวเล็กลงไปเยอะหลังสงครามเขาคงไม่รอดอยู่ในตำแหน่งอีกต่อไปผมเชื่ออย่างนั้น 100%

Francesca Cosentino	One of my personal favourites!<3
Alex Wolf	My Dad told me to listen to this song, so i heard it for the first time after he passed in Jan 2022. I grew up hearing my dad play Johnny and all the old greats that I never cared for. Now I miss them all, I dont listen to country, but something feels like it died with these guys.
Castellanos M. David	After all this time? How did I get here? What would I do to correct mistakes of the past if I had a chance? In my mind, I think these are some of the most asked questions that a human being makes itself when he/she has made a great mistake in his/her life and he/she had a desire to start again and do everything right. This song is perfect reflection of that thought. So, tell me everyone, do you agree with I have said?
Alphonsis61	All credit to the performance along with Reznor's lyrics, but special shout out to Rick Rubin for convincing Johnny Cash to record this song, and to Marc Romanek for directing this video. Iconic.

Jim Lawson	"Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments.
Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future.
Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for. Success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it."

Diondros	I always come back to this song at my lowest, today is one of those days. Every day I see myself slipping away little by little, not recognizing who I am and having more and more suicidal thoughts. Maybe I would be better off dead, maybe everyone I know would be better off if I was gone. I don't see much reason to keep on going nor do I think I'll find one in the long run. I just don't know how to live anymore with myself
มด แดง	ใช่พ่อใหญ่ผมเคยตั้งราคาไว้ประมาณนี้แหละผมว่ามันไม่ใช่ทรัพย์สินมันแพงกว่าที่ผมตั้งราคาไว้เยอะคือแพงจนขายไม่ได้ต่อให้เป็นเครื่องบินล่องหนยกที่ 6 ราคาแพงที่สุดในโลกมันยังมีราคาถูกกว่าชีวิตของนักบิน

The Darkest Horse	Trent Reznor may have given birth to this song, but it's been adopted, raised and fathered into the world at large by Johnny Cash. You can hear in his voice that every single word is a truth of his own. The man is wearing it just like one of his trademark black suits and it's a perfect fit 🖤

Robert Ronning	Dear Johnny Cash you are correct about this world you wore black for the pain of others the ones in pain did not see you the ones in control ignored you what have we left. Should God give the world to those who want to destroy the other half of the people I think that it's unavoidable now I thought that what I was doing was the right thing but I am ever convinced that what I am doing is a moot point

GuizioExtreme	dedico essa música a mim, durante toda minha vida vivi me crucificando por conta dos meus erros e me atormentando pelas cicatrizes do passado, num caminho de alto destruição , nesse caminho me deixei dominar pela solidão, angústia, depressão, rancor e ódio, assim abandonei aqueles que amava inclusive a mim mesmo, criando um vazio tão grande que nada era capaz de completar, no início a dor foi a única coisa capaz de me fazer sentir que estava vivo, mas com o tempo ela foi perdendo essa capacidade, por alguns meses eu apenas existir, o vazio sugou minha essência deixando um fantoche inativo num mundo sem cores, mas eu nunca cogitei acabar vez com tudo, sempre soube que tinha que matar oq havia dentro de mim eee com o tempo e mudando alguns hábitos comecei a ver algumas cores no mundo novamente, no inicio foi MUITO DÍFICIL,MUITO, sair da cama, sair do quarto, sair do vazio, com o tempo consegui me curar, não diria que totalmente sozinho mas o primeiro passo foi meu , apesar de todos meus defeitos , não poderia deixar de agradecer a mim mesmo por ter passado por tanta parada e continuar de pé, a dor e o vazio continuam cmg mas agr eu adestrei esses filha da puta, obg A MIM por tudo, vc é um cara lendário e único, e por tudo que vc já passou comece a viver<3

Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked, for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap.
Galatians 6:7 LEB

Hebrews 10:26 LEB

Blessed is the person who endures testing, because when he is approved he will receive the crown of life that he has promised to those who love him.

mari mari	"Johnnyさん、初めまして、日本から、しがない一般市民以下、精神疾患と疑われています、アンチ
アメリカ合衆国を、公言、拡声器する、浪花の真理子です。本名は松永真理子と申します。

さて、やっと、Johnnyさんに辿り着きました。賛同者の皆様、誠に有難うございます。

私は、Johnnyキャッシュさんを、知ったのが、映画「ウォークザライン」でした。本当に偶然の
たまたま、従兄を元気付ける為に、パッとポスターから、energyを感じて、、日本の、浪花は

阪急百貨店辺りで、この映画のポスターに釘付け、、、、何故？この映画を選んだのか？
はい、その昔、同じ映画館ではないのですが、？二十歳頃に、素敵なデートをした想い出の場所

だったからです、、、当時の私は、まるで夢のような一日を、、、生まれてから二度目？の恋

やがて、必ず離れ離れになると分かっていたのに、、、どうしても、離れる前に、勇気を出して

告白だけはしようと、、、、自分から電話をして、、、、やっと、デートしたんだっけ？ね～茂さん（笑）

話せば、長～くなるのですが、私は日本国の中でも、離島生まれ、今じゃ世界文化遺産とかに、認定された

はい、鹿児島県は奄美大島の中でも、過疎の村、、、、、、、大和村今里の出身でございまする。

高校を卒業して、江戸を目指すも、、、何故か？浪花に不時着（笑）まっ、それは良しとして、生まれてこのかた

熱しやすく冷めにくい体質？なのか？一途なのか？ストーカー気質なんだか、、、５１歳になる今日まで、

過去に過ぎ去った、片想い、憧れの男性など、、、、結婚し、子供も居るにも関わらず、脳内少女漫画末期症状らしいのです。

私は、旧姓が蘇畑と言います。そう、奄美大島と言えば、数々の特産品があるなかで、蘇鉄の実、、、蘇鉄畑って

歴史的にも、哀しい、、、、島民の、血と汗、、、これを語るには、薩摩藩の悪口になるので、メンドクサイので

はしょります。私は、自分の生い立ち、、苗字、名前が、、、、心底大嫌いでした。こんな、田舎、捨てて、早く自由に

なりたい、、、って夢見た都会が、何故か？江戸ではなく、浪花( ´∀｀ )そ、高校卒業後に、美容師見習いとして、

働いたのが、淀川区の十三辺り（笑）はい、ある日の午後？職場の自動ドア、扉が、、、パーカーんって開いた瞬間

まるでデジャビューのように、、、運命的に直観📡がビシバシ（笑）

で、出逢った人が、セカンドラブな、背の高い、うどん県出身の、香水マニアなキザなアラミスったmen'sでした。
当時の私と言えば、しがない美容師見習い二年目、、、同じ奄美出身のパイセン、まぁこ先輩のヘルプをしていたら、

扉パッカーンな、men'sのヘアカラーとかを、、、無駄にお喋りな私ですが、その昔は、まだまだ田舎の言葉もぬけきれない

垢抜けない。芋姉ちゃん、、、先輩のヘルプをしていると、何だかな～
センサーが、、、『この人とは何かある？起きる？』とか瞬時にロックオン。けれど、、、根っからのマイナス思考
ハリネズミな性格で、どうしたら良いものか？このモヤモヤ。ザワザワは一体何？お鼻はまだ、鼻炎なんて、無かった

けど、独自の嗅覚が、この香りは好き過ぎる、、、この人を好きになるに、、、（笑）あ、、何だか今更恥ずかしいや

この、恋の行方を語るには、、、まっ、二日では、、、おさまるかな（笑）

Johnnyさん、私がハリウッド映画を好きな理由の一つが、その彼に連れてもらった『恋のゆくえ』ミッシェルファイファーさん主演作
阪急ファイブの、コジンマリとした、映画館でした。Johnnyさん、すみません、眠さMax、、ちょっと休憩、

また、明日にでも、ウォークザラインについては、きちんと、まとめて書かせて頂きます。ヒント？セカンドラブ

香水、薔薇、空港の見えるＢＡＲ、ポートタワーなデード、白い車の、香水なｍｅｎ'ｓとのドラマチックrainな恋物語（笑）

men'sが✖なジャケット緑色、、、カメラ好きなのに、恥ずかしくて写真も撮れない、幼稚な純愛、、、、（笑）

って、デートなんて、、数回でしたよね？茂さん、、、、

Jack's Food & Music	Legend, is Rocking In Peace
Kolten Schibbelhut	I love this song, but the video with the song is the amazing part. Like he knew he was going soon and was thinking about everything he had gone through and the love he has for June will go on forever
Jennifer J	Crazy that he covered NIN
brian sumpter	I was reading the comments why do most people think johnny cash wrote this song it was originally done by nine-inch nails
Christoph Naumczyk	I dont k ow why but this song has always spoken so deeply to me
Yvonne Doyle	Such a fantastic deep song❤️❤️🌹❤️
Sacredgeometry	"She said she's dating someone else 
We just exchanged i-love-you's on the phone the other night.
_why_"
Mohammed Q	the fact that trent reznor said that this is johnny's song despite him coming up with it first will forever be fascinating.
ballaballapo	LOGAN!
Jeepers Creepers	i hurt myself today in an off hand way - just to hear say no way.
Shadow Knows	My theme song
Adam Mitchell	I'll take it ...if you don't want it I'll take it ..your empire of dirt ..it's better than what I got ..hell I'm broke !!!🤬
S Morton	Still beyond amazing
Gianpier Pieroni	This is the Trent Reznor tragedy, not the Johnny Cash tragedy !!!! Let's talk clear !
POP!	"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, God who became human, and be saved. Rom 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, —Rom 10:9 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

By his shed blood, death on the cross, burial, and resurrection back to eternal life 3 days later, by the power of Father God, you have forgiveness of sins and saves us from judgement/punishment, he took what we deserved on himself and gave us salvation, if we believe in him and what he did. Joh 3:16-18 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.

Nothing you do saves you or keeps you saved. You’ll do good because you’re saved, and Gods Holy Spirit in you will help you to do good, and let go of what’s bad. Eph 2:8-10 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."
Dominik Zarwanski	Wybitne ❤️
Kamran Rowshandel	"https://youtu.be/I5_BQAtwHws I know you're not the most religious Hindu on earth probably, but to tell you the truth, the reason why Hinduism has become a hate magnet is that Hindus have failed to describe it to others as ""A SECRET. PERIOD."" It must be the highest protected secret. In African religion, the penis is typically visible and the religion is typically covered. It's the same in Asia, even if we have Pierced socialisms."
Phedra	Very Nice
Ana Paula Luis Oliveira	Verdades,que bien canta y encanta,adoro
LW	i hate this
Mall Roccha	I remember of Catleya, Colombiana, i love this movie. ❤🥺
МАКС	СУПЕР
Nimrod's Son	It’s so fucked that Johnny Cash was basically forced to do this song, following the death of his wife. Imagine being this age and having no friends left, nothing from your life to ground you anymore and then having someone force you to this bullshit, only for you to die shortly after. This song is a sad cashgrab by greedy pieces of shit; Johnny Cash deserved better.
Laura Boudreaux	The goat!! :I still love you Johnny.  RIP.😌
carlos llabres	A legend! Here you have the link of an indie song filmed in Spain (Balearic Islands). https://youtu.be/SjQll1kIAjI

SOMESWAR RAO	A Masterpiece  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Demons Abode	Shout-out to nine inch nails Trent reznor for letting Johnny cash cover his song
11 Dimes	I’m cool 😎
Juan Felipe Rojas	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

I hope it helps you having the lyrics at hand.

I hope to do this with most of my favorite songs just to practice the lyrics while im listening to the song on YouTube"
Maybe	"Full of broken thoughts 
I cannot repair ."
Janine Albrecht	I agree, they all go away. I know it's old age...but who ya gonna hang with!

Wayne Charles	If tNice tutorials isnt the most true tNice tutorialng ive ever read
funky mess	nine inch nails' version is even more sad somehow

Lil me	What a legend. I havent watched this in the last year since I've become a fan as I knew it would be hard. What a fantastic choice of song and the video is epic. It's so sad to see such a beautiful young man old like that and to think he died so soon after.

Squid Cena	"Dang dude. This song hurts, because not only do I lose the ones I know, but also the ones I've never met as well, have only seen once, or so, and the ones I've never got to meet yet. Sucks to know that 7 billion people exist, all unique and different, yet they will be gone in dust.

I believe in heaven, hell, and God, but to know that majority are going to hell, sucks."
Emil Langhorn	Hope he is in his Spaceship on the way to the otherside! Johnny Cash was so good in live performance!  Check out: Highwaymen Live at Nassau 🥰

K M	"Everyone over 50 hits different than it did when you were 20.
Now it's can I crawl out of the bed before I pee myself
Age hurts
Laugh now younglings, your time is at hand."
Jacob Cox	His musical mastery for evoking emotion was monumental. Trent Reznor was floored by Cash’s cover of this song.
PaperThinnGlennHall	"No matter what you do or what you accomplish you will always feel like you could of done more regardless if it made you happy or not.

At times it feels like if you're not seeing friends or accomplishing dreams it feels like very day is a waste of time when it's not.

You are one person & you can only do so much. One day at a time."
TheModer8ter	"""Whosoever believes on the Son has everlasting life."" John 3:36.  Jesus of Nazareth, who was God in the flesh of a man, died for the remission of sin, including yours, was buried, and rose form the dead 3 days later.  If you simply believe in this to apply to you and trust Jesus to save you from hell then you have everlasting life in heaven.  As Jesus says in John 6:39 ""And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."""

Chris Laughlin	"Cash is a quadruple OG
Wearing black, smoking, drinking, popping pills like I everyday was his last. Gangster before gangster was cool.
He was a living legend when he passed. I don’t even listen to country or rock n roll, but listen to Cash.

RIP"
Joe Henderson	I heard this song come on in a thrift store last weekend. I pulled over to help a confused looking woman (who told me she has a brain tumor and gets nervous) get to the building safely. I’ll just say I’m glad I had sunglasses on.

ReloadPsi	"Reznor: teenage/young adult depression
Rusty Cage: a midlife crisis ending in tears
Cash: reflecting on one's life and wondering if one's done all the right things

Reznor was a goddamn genius writing this. A slight change in instrumentation and vocals and the song takes on all kinds of meanings. Even he was surprised by that."
Mart141	it hurt when i discovered that this is a cover song
Editha Lemm	Wow, heute am 12.07.2022 habe ich in der Serie,, rote rosen,, nicht schlecht gestaunt, als johnny cash Lied   .. hurt ..   gespielt wurde. Rip johnny.  dieses Lied ist so beeindruckend  tiefgründig, besonders mit dieser honorigen Stimme  .. Danke

Joe Hill	This really brings me to tears…
Seb's Shenanigans!	"""If I could start again, a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way.""
A lot of interpretations I've read paint these lines in a negative light, as if the writer is claiming that he will fall right back into the pit of rot even if he started a new life a million miles away.
For some reason I always saw it as a more hopeful line, a declaration of :""I will keep myself, I won't lose my head to drugs (or other sickness plaguing my soul)."""
Sistine	🖤

Luis alvarez	"Trent Reznor who wrote this said, ""this is now Johnny's song"""
Catríona Sloanei	The fact this ever got published is weird as it comes off as much more than just a cover song by him. It comes off as a very emotional way of saying good bye to his family.

This video showed so much of his truth and he will forever be missed"
Alex Fout	"""Everyone I know goes away in the end"" is hitting me especially hard. I've listened to this song dozens of times but that's the lyric that's getting me the most right now. In the span of about a year, I've had my mom and three really close friends pass away. That lyric is really describing how I've been feeling recently"

JR Strong	"I understand now!! 
RIP John and June"

SoTired	"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16

God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time."
Aaron Levitt	He saved his best for last.
Kaya 07	Fucking legend.
ʀᴇʟᴀʏ	One of the first thing I learned to play on my guitar. I still love this
Angelica Luce	His album recorded in PRISON - made especially for the PRISONERS - BROKE MY HEART - Check it out.  Johnny was a drug addict for many years - this album was UNLIKE ANY OTHER - CLOSE TO THE BONE
Sinamae Mead	I love this video. I miss my dad. Love you. ❤
stupididiot	this is how people describe post-nut clarity
Angelica Luce	I've ALWAYS LOVED JOHNNY - even as a little kid - even tho I didn't know WHY  - I just KNEW he was GOOD.  I'm listening NOW - I'm 79 - it's my BIRTHDAY TODAY.    Today, I got to.  1:23.   and I had to STOP IT.   I couldn't TAKE IT.   It's just one of those things - TODAY, the MEANING of HIS LIFE - HIT ME LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.    GOD BLESS YOU JOHNNNY
Elioenai Santiago	i filmed a cover of this song, if you wanna check it out
Adam Chwiałkowski	First time I was listening  to this song was 2013. I was 15. Damn. Times flies by so fast. I will be 25 soon. Did not understood the meaning of this song than. And I doubd I get it right now.
Faris Bean	Can't relate yet
Bas Bogaard	This man got out of prison in 2011 after 12 years. That means he went to prison in 1999. For those of you who remember the year 1999, the entire world was much much different than in 2011. No iPhones, social media wasn’t mainstream, no 3G data networks, texting wasn’t used as much because it took 10 minutes to type out a text on a phone, etc. This man is facing a massive technological culture shock. If a time traveller from 1999 came to 2011, he would be saying all the same things regarding “people don’t want relationships anymore” and “Phones are people’s idols”
Albert Corbeil	This song brought a tear to my eye. The older we get, the more those we love go away.
Nix Bronowski	I gotta admit..hearing it from an old-timer whose been thru alot.........

I've never seen someone take such a strong, recently popular song and own it like this. It's Johnny's song. 

So glad we had Johnny and June and that we have Trent Reznor."
Conor Brennan	Rest easy the man and the legend
richard roughton	To see if I still feel

Paul S	An effing true American and musical treasure.
xXelitegpXx	"""Beneath the stains of time, the feelings dissappear"" ain't that true. Just like that we forget and move on. And what once was gutwrenching heartache, is now lost in the abyss. ""You are someone else, I am still right here "" . And they dont even know..."
Somethin'sMusky	"come out of it girl... 😢 put the dope down for good and come get healthy again I'm here...

Nick Barton	Such a deeply emotional song with many connections to Johnny Cash‘s life. The imagery and expressiveness make it haunting and authentic. Just looking at the leathered appearance of his face makes you feel all the pain that he absorbed or experienced over the decades. June Carter Cash being in this video brings it home for me as well. A life well lived and a fitting way to memorialize it
David Barnes	I just watched the man in columbo, what a voice
Evan 2.0	My father was in a lot of torrment his life and i wish i could've helped him through it before he passed of a heart attack, he thought himself as not the man we saw him as, i just wish he could've seen himself through my eyes. 2022-06-18 Rip
Shawn Carlson	"I feel Johnny ""brings something special to this song"
Lisa Maree Crothers	I absolutely love how Johnny Cash made this song more popular. Imo it’s one of the only covers that’s better than the original.
bradock	Esse man0o é o mano
Johnnie Sugar Presents	I am struggling, is this the best cover ever or is it Chris Cornell with Nothing Compares to U?
JAY JAY COLON	The Most powerful song I ever heard … wow!!!! This touched me .. related so much to the words and the way he sang it with his soul .. RIP J Cash🙏🏻
fana406	This song reminds me of a studiomate from college but not in a good or bad way, in a gross kinda way. He was the first guy ever that showed me that mens budholes sweat like underpitts. His budhole was so sweaty it left a water mark under there
G. Tremblay	All due respect to Nine Inch Nails, but my opinion is that this is the best version of this song.

Lionheart Forever	In my opinion, this may be his most significant hit ever. Some might differ, but this is how I feel.
the sane party	"It's a strange comment on music. 
Bobby Fischer fell out of love with chess, because he could glance at a board and know every move that had taken place. 
He envied mo-town musicians because he couldn't see the math behind their music.
But there is nothing new under the sun for musicians either, and yet magic still happens.
Trent Reznor watched this video and knew that his song was no longer his.
What is that string that ties us apart?"
Lencho	"[LYRICS]

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
William Nimbach	This is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard in my entire life!!!
a e	"I lost my cat like 7 months ago, because of wrong treatment of doc. He couldn't make it up. 
Discovered this song like several months ago. Some of my friends couldn't relate what a lost could feel on the body and mind because they never have a pet in their lifetime. If you ever pet you can relate what it feels. It's above humanity. I still miss him, he was my first real friend beyond human. Whenever I feel upset or down i remember his memories and play this song to keep them alive.. Lyrics are so related and reminds me of him.. He is still living in my heart and I miss him so much and i bless everybodys pet and family, you never know what will happen tomorrow. He was so young to be an angel but we couldn't help him. Universe bless him well and i hope and believe he is hearing me and i know he is at better place right now better than earth!"
John Hnat	Who else saw June and suddenly realized they were peeling onions?

WillyTheComposer	The greatest cover song of all time
Frank Mueller	I will cheat myself....
Harley Quinn	"How the natural aging process impacts the Pathological Narcissist.

Note: I am not in any way implying that Johnny Cash was a Narcissist (I don’t know enough about him to speculate whether or not he was, and I watched the Walk The Line movie and a documentary about him). I have been on a 5 year journey of Narcissistic Abuse Recovery and I recognize the description in the song’s lyrics applying to what happens to Pathological Narcissists as they age."
Schwadevivre	Irreplaceable
Rich Cudo	Everytime I watch this its like saying goodbye again. Such a fitting cover
Austin Mcknight	One of my dads favorite he passed away two weeks ago first time listing to it since and somehow it has a completely different meaning to be now

Unlock Power Official	2:30 ... =(
Terry Dixon	I wonder if he knew, that those lyrics was the creation of an addicted artist?
Eric Abbott	You can feel the pain in his voice as he sings this song! He cries out from his heart! His soul is tortured! That's the worst kind of hurt you can experience!!
Kieron Deveney	If you are going to have an epitaph ...
K W	No one will *ever* be able to give a finer performance of *any* song *ever.* Rest in peace, and may perpetual light shine upon you, Johnny.

Lee McKenna	The way June looks at him...
Lee McKenna	Recorded 20 years ago... STILL THE SAME GUT PUNCH EVERYTIME.
DAVE HENRY	I grew up a huge NIN fan.  When I had a friend call me and say that another artist had covered Trent's song I was perplexed.  I thought covering Trent is like covering Hendrix.  You can give it your best effort and still not better the original.  And then I saw this video.  I still remember the moment as being absolutely stunned.  The Man in Black not only covered the song, but made it his own.  The most powerful goodbye an artist has ever done.  Or ever will.  RIP Mr. Cash.
Roblox lover 568	I’m tired.
Maxime Mavlyutov	Thanks rick rubin
spencer	the older i get the more this resonates with me.  when you think about it,  material things really amount to jack squat.  who cares what your career is, how much money you make, or how much stuff you accumulate in your life. for the average person,   in 20, 50, 100 years after you die, maybe even sooner,  someone will remember you for the last time, and thats it, it'll be like you never even existed.  lifes just one big joke  and people desperately cling to things to try and make sense of it all.
Lebron James Cult	There will never be another Johnny Cash
Luz Terrazas	Q hermoso hombre me fascina. De principio ah fin eres un encanto johnny cash❤️❤️

BreAnn Mueller	I'm sobbing, watching this today. Such a powerful and moving piece of work... seeing the juxtaposition of Johnny and June from many years ago, and then seeing them months before their passing is heart-wrenching and bittersweet. We only have one life to live... are you happy and living your life to its fullest? <3

Ruth	"4a.m. (ct) Wed. June 29, 2022. I've been reading ""Johnny Cash, The Redemption of an American Icon"" the last few weeks. I am now on page 316 regarding HURT. I am now seeing this for the first time. The reading & this video is very touching to me, being a 64  yrs young Black Lady.  We all can learn from someone else's life if we take the time to Self-exam ourselves on Life itself & not skin color. Blessings to all that may read this. Sincerely, from a Child of Christ. Amen"
Touhou forever 15	As a Irish person I'm not the biggest fan of Johnny cash but I have a lot of as a person he showed me that not all people from the South were in favour of the trail of tears.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR BIRTHRIGHT!!!!!!!He personally carried our sins in his body on the cross so that we can be dead to sin and live for what is right. By his wounds.  you are healed. - 1 Peter 2:24 - NLT that through us Lord you may be seen keep praying keep seeking and knocking and it will come to you Repent and ask Jesus help you come to him and be authentic not doing things for him as a chore and pray for faith in him.
 
Matthew 7:9-11
“Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will         give him a stone?(10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? (11 So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.

No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.
John 1:18

He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?

Bella Vita	"Reflection
What’s the worst thing I’ve stolen? Probably little pieces of other people’s lives. Where I’ve either wasted their time or hurt them in some way. That’s the worst thing you can steal, the time of other people. You just can’t get that back.

Chester Bennington"
ssdq	Every few days I come back to this song to get f'ed up. I can't get this kind of feeling anywhere else, no song, no relationship, anything. This is really something special for me. See you next week, month, year, decade..
Michele Benini	Elvis2
Meadow full of daisies	#🎙
Jacob Ruthenberg	This is the song I play when I'm feeling depressed
john thomas rushton	A message to everybody who is using this song for inspiration or to justify destroying your own body's and life, worse the people that love you. Ultimately its down to you and stop blaming others, you can lead a horse to water.....stop feeling sorry for yourself and do something about it by setting little goals in your day. Rome was not built in a day remember that. Stop being selfish and look at what you are doing to the people that love you. PLEASE HELP YOURSELF.

Linda Smith	This song is one I listen to when I lost everything in my life
ZiLoX	I am concerned with how many times i come back to this
Supersquid 1776	This video and song and message are much deeper than many realize. Johnny became a Christian in the late 80s early 90s. He wrote a book about it. At the end of the video when they were pounding spikes in Jesus hands and he was hanging on the cross Johnny was saying Christ took care of everything Johnny was describing about his life!
KAMAZON	one of the saddest parts of this video is his fingers trembling on the guitar so close to the end. Rest in peace Mr. Cash
N Siddharth	this song was SO FITTING in the logan trailer! so saddening :((
Evelyn	Desearía saber inglés para comprender tantas canciones 💖 bellas como está
Rob Shook	Perhaps in addition to preparing for his own death, Johnny wrote this as a confession of sorts to his Lord Jesus. The subtleties in his lyrics suggest this. Powerful song.
Christopher Hason	I never liked you anyway kill a man just to watch him die ya never had any interest what so ever in you Biiiiiiiitttttcccccchhhhhhh!!
Michelle Reilly	He owned this cover. NIN cant even do their own song like Johnny Cash did.

CAM	Was visiting my old school for the nephews graduation. Don’t really visit it much. When I was walking out thinking of how 20 years have gone by since my graduation, and how I lost touch with everyone, and some of them dead now this is the song that came into my head. It’s funny, because I thought how it’s weird I was into NIN that much when I was younger, but after hearing the cheese at the graduation ceremony that side of me came right back out lol. However it was Cash’s version I heard, which is weird. Amazing lyrics with a legend singing.
Zach 'Don Puro' Schafer	The part at 2:52 with the wine glass always gets me dude. Every freakin’ time…

Marv	Jesus man saddest song I know

PreussischeArmee	"Should have covered ""Closer"" instead."
John Moran	YES ---
TieMi	someone has come along
Denis Zvorc	USA😍😍
lAcid Rainl	The thing I hate most about having loved ones is knowing I'm going to lose them some day
Henry Hillier	"For many times I first listened to this song, I cried more than I have at some funerals- to me this song is full of his REGRET, the way he treated his wife June Carter & his substance abuse.
I believe he wrote this song with a depressed mentality, looking back at his whole life with too many regrets, forgetting the good he bought to ppls lives & forgetting what a great musician he was.
But this song wasn't ABT any of that for him, it was him highlighting his regrets, mistakes & pain he caused others, he painted this song almost like his whole life was a stuff up. But of course we all know that's not entirely true. He has many regrets & guilt he wishes he could start again, a million miles away & do it all the right way or differently, I get that 💯💯"
AB G	Im not crying, you are
Harry Tietze	"Johnny's version of ""Hurt"" is simply the best. Thanks , partner."

StarLynne	Seeing the pain and emotion in his eyes always gets me cause I know that pain all too well.  Wishing you could do it all over again and knowing that you never can. Time stops for no one. And it is never kind. Enjoy your youth and enjoy the ones you love. It will all be gone in the blink of an eye and you will be wishing you had. ✨️
8MichaelAnthony	I just learned the story of this song NIN and trying to dig up more about it. Damn.

Art GARCIA	🖤
Art GARCIA	Hello Johnny
V V	Great depth and tone in his weathered voice
Nikolina	Ovo ne mogu opisati. Sve koje znam odu na kraju. Jebes slavu.
Baby Wise	At 44 this song hits way harder than it did at 27 when I first heard it. The things I've accumulated that I was once so proud of are now just.. shit and house debris. This whole dame thing called life just gets away from you before you know it. Live everyday as your last is (although cliché) solid advice.
Lord Nemo	Thank you Mr. Cash, for a lifetime of reaching into people's hearts.
DONALD GRONDIN	✝️ appreciate your music
Awakenowadays	Too bad a memory of Vivian with their 4 young children wasn't in this beautiful video. Bittersweet 💔. The documentary 'My Darling Vivian' is an important story that sheds truth on his life before June Carter.💯
G.o.o.F	The fact most everybody on this comment thread doesn't even know this song is a cover and the original song was from nine inch nails and came out in 94 is dumb founding to me
Darkling	You left this Earth in 2003 and left an amazing legacy that can never truly be forgotten. Gone, but remembered, missed and treasured always.

PsychedelicExperience	It was his goodbye to the world.
Stating the obvious	"I’m in Nashville and went to the Johnny’s Cash museum today
One area has a screen playing hurt with some props from the video
A group of us stood watching, holding back tears
This song hits harder than anything I’ve heard
And I can relate to it.
 I always cry so hard."
qwp	i know it's ridicolous to compare my self to a dying celebrity, but sometimes i feel like i also lost everything
TheEddor	"My Grandpa is an old man, he was born in 1938 and he is in the sunset of his life. nine days ago his older brother died at age 94. Pa was the youngest sibling and now the last one living. this song hits hard because I know he is hurt, all the weight of the sorrow of life and time.

I love u Gancho, a good man and a strong one."
chris johnson	"This is called Realization of mortality. And with the blasphemous iconography he understands his empire is ""dirt"" because he is going to hell."
Jacob Car	Best music video ever. I tear up  every time I watch it. It is so poignant, and filled with emotion. The visuals compliment the song perfectly.
Matt Cherry	Right on Johnny you spoke to me in the seventies and now bless you.
Lukk	❄️♾️
I am Gauty	What we had with June and John was a perfect balance of chaos and order. Which allowed them to live write and play in parallel none of us touch. Harmonic balance
Allan Clark	RIP peace, my love. Joy M. Cardona Clark.
Allan Clark	"And when does the hurt end. 
When you finally join her in her in the choir invisible."

Nick Growall	GOAT’d video
Michael Ahlrichs	Cc mm
Scott A. Patricia	The best cover ever made.
KITdaBerserker	"Ex heroin addict here. The original hit me hard, but Johnny made me weep. All the hurt I caused I cannot even begin to process and confront fully to this day. The Manipulation and lies.  Things I still cannot even say out loud.  It's been 5 years since I quit.  Today my life is nothing like it was and even still to this day my demons haunt me.  I tell myself I was a sick and twisted person, I tell myself I'm no longer this person and I know it to be true.  But knowing all of that doesn't begin to stop the pain sometimes.  

RIP POPPA.  I LOVE YOU WITH ALL OF MY HEART.  I KNOW YOU ARE PROUD AND I WORK HARD EVERYDAY TO BE THE MAN I AM TODAY.  

GOD BLESS YOU ALL.  I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT I LOVE YOU WITH ALL OF MY HEART."

Soldier DJT	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way."
dwb 1andonly	Can't wait for the peace of death. I'm too much of a coward to bring it upon myself, and too much of a coward to run towards it, but the loneliness I face today, in the past, and in my future is unbearable. Every one I know goes away and has already gone away... in the end. I will finally rest. An endless sleep full of dreams. Dreams of the life I wish I would and could have lived if I could go back. it's already too late for me. Yet it is too early for me to rest in peace. So I shall live in pieces. Until I can once and for all be whole.
Jhony Glens Márquez	He venido tantas veces a esta canción para comprobar si realmente siento…

🎄FlyingGordonProductions 4🎄	"Most people just think oh it’s just a song 
But you should really just listen to what they sing about there is always a message"
njcurmudgeon	This song was written by a younger man, Trent Reznor, who comes from a different musical tradition - not better or worse, just different. It took on a whole new and different meaning when sung by an old man facing his mortality. One of those rare and special moments when a cross-pollination of genres and generations created something truly transcendent.
John Basden	Nine Inch Nails wrote the  song, but decided to let Johnny Cash to sing it

I made a Japanese translation not from NIN original. 
I made it if this song was written by Johnny Cash himself. 
And I also covered the song. 
I know my cover is not good but I have cancer, so I can feel him.
My cover is at the bottom.

日本人の人の為に、ジョニーの人生を振り返ってみて、彼の視点から和訳をしたよ。
下のリンクは自分でカバーした歌。
下手だけど良かった聴いてね。

I hurt myself today
また自分を傷つけた
To see if I still feel
まだ俺は痛みを感じるのか
I focus on the pain
痛みを受け入れたら
The only thing that's real
痛みだけが本物だった

The needle tears a hole
注射器の針が血管に刺さる
The old familiar sting
古い昔からの刺し傷
Try to kill it all away
全部消そうとしたさ
But I remember everything
でも全部思い出すんだよ

What have I become
俺はどうしちまったんだ
My sweetest friend
俺の最愛の人
Everyone I know
結局、最後はみんな俺から離れていくんだよ
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
君は全てを手にする事が出来きたんだ
My empire of dirt
俺が土で創った帝国も
I will let you down
君を失望させるだろう
I will make you hurt
傷付けると思う

I wear this crown of thorns
棘の冠をかぶってる
Upon my liar's chair
嘘にまみれて創った椅子に座って
Full of broken thoughts
壊れた思考の塊
I cannot repair
もう治せない
Beneath the stains of time
汚れた人生に囚われたら
The feelings disappear
その感覚さえも消え去った
You are someone else
君だけは違っていたよ
I am still right here
俺はここにいるんだよ

What have I become
何でこうなった
My sweetest friend
君だけは違うはずだった
Everyone I know
でもみんなは
Goes away in the end
行くんだよ

And you could have it all
お前らに全部くれてやるよ
My empire of dirt
俺が土で創った帝国も
I will let you down
俺に失望させてやるよ
I will make you hurt
お前らを痛めつけても気にしない

If I could start again
もしずっと遠い所でやり直せるなら
A million miles away

I will keep myself
このままの俺だけど
I would find a way
そっちで君を探すよ

Slack Slack	They played this for the trailer for Logan. They should’ve made it the theme song for the movie.
April Russell	What a fitting song for such an extraordinary man who's life was full of pain and hurt. I personally think it's one of the best recordings he ever done because it was a story that described how he looked at his life and you can feel the emotional connection he felt to it. There will never be another Johnny Cash. He is a true legend. I still cry when I hear him sing this song.

John Howell	"Music is wholesome and still it seems Johnny let his ego get the best of him at times. 
Death brings forth our regrets. 
Let's take a moment to contemplate what we are doing in our own lives and the effects on the world around us.
If we don't do it now, we will get a good look at it come our own end of time.

There is very little we NEED to be doing, if we are serious about it. But a lot to do if we want to get to that point.
And no, I'm not talking about human or A.I slaves but rather Living within our means, physically and not financially.

Feeling the love of all those before us and all who are here now... And don't love cut like a knife x"

Uwe Koch	His last and best song👍👍👍👍💐💐
Mark Wassink	Is this like going to the rich man door door
Luis rodrigues coelho	"Unfortunately this song was Johnny telling the tale and ETERNAL consequence of having made a pact with the devil in order to get famous and wealthy. The entire lyrics are very obvious for those who discern the spiritual world and how it works... he even said ""if I could start again, I would find the way""... - the words of someone who knows is doomed for eternity.
I truly hope Johnny repented and asked forgiveness before he died; many people believe they are doomed due to such contracts, but that is not correct - God forgives if one repents and asks for forgiveness.
I hope Johnny did!!!"
Jesus Is GOD Almighty Amen	"*The Victorious Glorious Gospel of Grace.*

Shalom everyone.
Peace mercy and grace be to you.
Thank you for this upload.
Please have patience with me.

We can all see that this world is missing something.
We have great joy and bring you the best news ever, for everyone.
This is been given to us freely and will be given freely.
The Lord your God Jesus The Christ is the savior of everyone. No exceptions !
Not having any respect of persons, giving Grace and love to all, everyone in its own order.
He is the savior of the world and will reconcile all things to Himself.
Not death nor a misunderstood physical place called ""hell"" to give a spirit of fear and to control you, will separate us from His love. God forbid.
God already triumphed over every enemy by the cross.
Pray to Him, He is faithful in all things.
None will be lost.
Believe in Him, His everlasting mercy and never ending grace towards us and rejoice.

Thank you for your patience reading this.

Black sky	If I die, this song will be the reason
Red River Loft	"John’s genius is never more evident than it is with this song. No singer songwriter will ever be his equal in communicating to and from the downtrodden in our society. Such songs of his as, What Is Truth, and The Man In Black established him as such, but Hurt is so much more profound.

When my time comes, I want Hurt and One Tin Soldier sung."
The FrontRoom	This is the greatest music video I have ever seen And I am not even a Cash fan really.
Rocky Severino	forget the song for a moment, look at his performance in this video. i've rarely seen a performer so effortlessly confident. This is a lifetime on stage gifted to us in absolute fearlessness. What a man.

Shion Chan	My grade 12 English teacher was the first person to show me this song. Only 3 years have passed and I've lost 2 of my best friends. I ended up writing an essay for my uni English class about this song and how the message stays the same but the listener perspective of it changes as they live there life. I compared it to when I first heard it. Its crazy how fast life goes.
Maximiliano Buscaroni	Te quiero Jhonny, dónde estés. Gracias! Desde Rosario, Argentina
Diego Marx Weiller	I've hurt myself today...
Darren Milligan	What a powerful song, and unfortunately  I have recently lost most of my family and friends,and I can't wait for my turn now, I just  find there is nothing left to live for.
Patrick Garrett	I'm in no way a Johnny Cash fan but I do have respect for him as a songwriter. That being said, this is the absolute worst & most overrated cover song I have ever heard. NIN version is epic but in my opinion, Cash almost singlehandedly ruined everything great about this song. Rick Rubin should be slapped for encouraging this pitiful trainwreck! To be fair though, the video was cool.
freddy gaming	J'adore cette musique . Elle Inspire tellement de chose
Wagner Moura Pereira	John cash,o cara canta muito, the Best
Somalo Ignoto	Historically old dead devil
Groopa2 vshui08	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
B L	"Alcoholics Anonymous is the answer. I cannot say it enough. It's the golden ticket to sobriety. I am 7 months sober. Please reach out for help. I care about all sick and suffering addicts and alcoholics.
I promise you will find your higher power. Plenty of people want to help you and remember God or your higher power helps those who help themselves. Let this miracle happen to you, please."
John Reynolds	They won't let me upload?? I
Mary Thompson	We were there me and my sister with our dying brother and we had a private Johnny Cash concert. The brother even tried to sing a bit. He passed a week ago. Still hurting but thanks Johnny Cash for that private YouTube concert.

TheHopSays	"""You are someone else... I am still right here.""

These lyrics go right for the jugular."
Fluff Mcgirt	These aren't tears I'm having an allergic reaction, too depression....you, me, everyone we are not alone in our fight but f*ck why does it always feel like it. If your reading this and are listening to this for the same reason I am I want you to know that you are a unique individual who is most definatly under appreciated for what you do and I want you to know I respect you for waking up everyday and pushing through to me you are one of the strongest people out there and I love you for your willingness to fight, stay strong and never stop being you...
William Goodrick	Knowing a little of the context of Johny's life and worldview. The song/video seems to point to the hope in Christ who can cover our brokenness and sinfulness if we accept him as Lord and Savior.
Ken Weis	I tried to suicide 2 months ago....as I lost consciousness this was playing in my head....somehow I was saved by the police....when I woke up this was still ringing

Andrew Gonzalez	It’s HIS song now
Achilles_Wrath	Better than the original. Also love when the man comes around i believe it was on the same CD.
Marc B.	Nothing to comment really...the performance speaks for itself...beautiful
Jerry Towns	I believe Johnny Cash knew the LORD Jesus - all our own pursuits in life are sandcastles fading in the realm of Gods eternal glory - but like in this video, the Cross of Christ and God's love and will is eternal....you can see all the fame and fortune in Johnny's walk did not mean much to him or to God ultimately, but a humble life and I believe he is in heaven praise the LORD
ConBurgundy	I just learned that the band Nine Inch Nails is the first person to make this song and also their influence is behind Old Town Road by Lil Nas X. Found that interesting.
CB SON	This song hits hard … and this is the first time I have heard this song.
PuggoVR ThePug	I came here after codfish doing the cover
justBill	I heard this song about 20yrs ago. I honestly thought nin covered it because as AMAZING as this cover was. This one is more legit. Lol
Top Score English	What strikes me as unsettling about this song is that Cash, a devout Christian, seemingly uses Christian imagery not as a hopeful, uplifting backdrop, but as creepy, graveyard-like symbolism. It is as though God had become his oppressor and Cash had lost his faith. I don't need to hear this song again.
Luca Scaglione	Logan...tu hai ancora tempo
Jack Mustang	"I have a feeling this song was the end of Cash as his life was ending, and he had only a tiny amount of time left.
This will be the song I sing when I enter old age."
Gregory Veshkin	Спасибо
Chelene Sabac	still remember Logan?
U2 Yourdaddy	"บทเพลงที่จะทำให้คุณดิ่งสู่ก้นบึ้งของอารมณ์ซึมเศร้า

Dream Surfer	Hey you. Yes, you. You're probably scrolling through the comments, like I am, reading all these motivational comments. If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don't stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don't dwell on things from the past, don't stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. For me, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, hit the gym, and cherish life for the amazing blessing that it is. I hope you do the same and have an amazing day as well!

Thomas G	First time I heard this song it was on  Nine Inch Nails album, too young to understand the lyrics but never forgot the sound.
DFastX	This song reminds me of Logan Wolverine. One of my favourite marvel movies of all time. It is a masterpiece
opus dei	and what is the power and tragedy? the dude did not suffer from unloved and hard work, did not die young, was not killed, but was engaged in easy and pleasant, well-paid work, was recognized and died in old age
William Hoeweler	Such a powerful and sad truth in this song. I love the videos of his past flashing by as he lays it all out

Sofia södergård åkesson	This video is so touching! Melancholic, too. The song and video combined goes straight to the heart. Its like mourning the things gone wrong in one’s life.
Sofia södergård åkesson	"This song could be my soundtrack to the last two weeks. I have done lots of bad things to myself during that time, and for the last 9 days, i have been hospitalized. But in two days they will discharge me. And today, i have NOT hurt myself, first time in two weeks. There are still many hours left today, but i have made a promise, and i Will keep it.❤️ This Will be a new start, If i let it . I have no hope of never being hospitalized again, since im permanently ill. But hey, i can make the best of the situation and, with the Lord’s help, take control!
I choose to be this open because, well, This is my reality, and since it Will allways be If there is no miracle, there is no reason to hide it !"
kiwi-freedom	This is one of the greatest songs. The lyrics are raw and the simplisty of the music really touches the heart.
Alyssa Maxwell	I can't listen to this song without crying and I've heard it so many times.
tjnaples	Maybe life understands hurt.
Louis_Animations	This song reminds me of my papa jer. He died April 25th peacefully. As he was about to die he reached out for Jesus's hand. He stretched his arm to the Heavens. He can finally see his wife.

Felipe D.Paula	Em todos meus momentos felizes e triste me pego ouvindo essa música
Adam Saladin	Garbage
Jake Hesser	this song literally separated me from everything and made me think about life more than stuff like I've never felt in my whole life, no matter who you are you will always have regrets and never beat old age, and the fact that him and June loved each other for as long as they did and he died right after her cuz he couldn't live without her is the most beautiful thing in the world
Buster Nutt	I use to think Jimi's cover of All Along the Watchtower was the greatest cover ever until I heard this. Johnny OWNS it!
Black Talon	"My baby boy died. And I don't understand how everyone can just continue on about their life like nothing happen3d. He was my entire world and I loved him more than life and he's dead. He was 18 years old and I knew it was coming but I wish it didn't happen. I can't even express how much I love him and miss him. And as soon as he died my mother just started cleaning everything he ever touched and like erasing every part of his existence. I wanted to come home and smell his smell a little longer. I wanted it to fade away by itself like his body rotting away in the earth. And yet she just got rid of every trace of him as soon as I put him in the ground. This song kind of helps me in a way I guess because it let's me know other people have gone through what I am. I shouldn't have to bury my baby brother. And I don't want to live anymore without him. And I hate the fucking replacement being they got. He's an idiot. And he's not my brother. And I'm supposed to continue on living for at least 80 more years without him. And I don't know if I can do it. I wish I could die and just be with him.  And the knowledge that I'm going to have to bury his replacement and I'll still he considered ""young"" is almost too much for me. I don't think I can do it. I don't want to. I don't want to go that long without him. I just want my baby brother back."
Chad Carlisle	"And that is the question we all ask ourselves
""What have I become"""
Seth Jaspan	This song is amazing, that he could take a metal song with a totally different meaning and make it so clearly his musical goodbye. Him closing the piano at the end gives me goose bumps.

B L	"This is the ""vibe"" I get from our beautiful country. I love the United States. The greatest country in the world. We are watching the ""dumbing of a nation"" as we legalize marijuana. Should it be legal, my answer is yes. Where will the responsibility of future generations fall? On the family. If we fail at teaching our children that drugs and alcohol are something to fear then some of this can be avoided. I have failed in this department. God bless America. God help America. God bless our law enforcement agencies. The problems are about to take a monumental shift from illegal to legal. This is not the solution. No the prison s should not be filled with marijuana dealers. We can build our own mental prison by failing to heed the warning signs of addiction. I hope all American families can cope with what's to come....."

Ni Made Rai Maryati	He is telling us his whole life story instead of singing. I got strong emotion each time I heard this song
Golden G	This is a much better version that the one by Six Inch Nails
K Apple	"Johnny Cash made a heavy metal song written by an atheist that was good, brilliant with his added religious connotation. I love both Reznor and Cash - but this version is far superior.... mind you reznor is clearly already a cultural christian in his lyrical influence ""I wear this crown of thorns "".... or at the very least a cultural jew.... or a cultural monolithic religion based westerner."
Robert Mccann 17	👍🎲

König Oliver l. von Sachsen	Ich freu mich schon.

MR MAIN	"I recently heard a young woman cover this song, albeit ok cover, it makes you appreciate the tone of johnnies beaten down voice, the pain in the old soul is what makes it! 
Complete sadness but utter beauty all at the same time."
Absurdnoodles	I went to sleep listening to this and now it sounds different and I have no clue why.
Mike Such	I've tried to listen to the song three times I just can't finish it. I'm a retired disabled vet living in the desert everybody I know has gone away. I mainly leave these messages pretend I'm talking to somebody take care everyone look at each other
jo schmo	The closing of the piano and the way he does at the end always makes me feel a certain way. It’s as if he closes that piano, he is also closing the final page of his life.
Kay Ray	I never realised how beautiful this song was until I learned to play it on the guitar.
Tony G	What hurts is being able to remember everything, 1994.
Gabriel Harmon	Please God .. forgive Eric. Remember his heart in the beginning.
ThinkingOutLoud	I listen to this song …just to see if I still feel.  The tears it brings are so very welcome.  I wonder how many years (centuries?) of life he added to this world with the impact of this performance?
Kingvenderose ⭐	I feel like playing this at my grand mothers funeral but idk if I’ll be able to keep from crying, I’m a grown man who doesn’t like when ppl comfort me🤷🏽

AR-.556 .45Tim-1911	No matter how many times I hear this song it still makes me cry.  I saw nine inch nails in concert and they played this video on the backdrop and it made me tear up there also.  I like Johnny Cash’s version better but the lyrics I feel deep into my soul.
Rachel Mortensen	Very few things/people qualify as Timeless. Jonny Cash is Timeless.

Wikingo	Hi MYTH! ♥
lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Urgent, proof of world wide satanic conspiracy"". Urgently look at a hidden message on Ste. Peter's Basilica, in Rome Italy!  Encoded in the statues on the building, for telling WW3!  Look at these bible scriptures as further proof, Romans1:23, Deuteronomy5:8, Romans1:25, Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18, 18:4,6,24;John the Baptist, Jesus....  This is information hidden in plain sight till now(Daniel12:4). War is starting to hide this.*  The Mark of the beast is on the shield of the Empire and on top of their buildings.  666 is on the three level crown(vicarius filii dei). *Germany is now concealing historical information about WW2 and that Nazi war on Russia, which killed more of their population than almost all other nations involved combined.  Was this a war of the Roman Empire?  Both Catholic and Protestant legs of the Roman Empire.  History shows a lot of evidence in that direction.  The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though he had a vast network of informants.*  The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  *1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible's for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD, the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul).*  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2 war.  NATO Countries setting up the ministry of truth, to control their people's minds.  *Turkey is where Gog and Magog are of the Bible's Ezekiel 38, and is surrounded by seas, which to be driven in to as per the Bible's description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the ""seat of Satan"".  Rosh in Hebrew means head, but just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn't mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Search them out, and don't start a war on falsehoods!*  A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor, for speaking about Biblical matters.  *Ron Desantis* says Acts2:44(communism) of the Bible must be overthrown, so the Pope can take his rightful place as 1John5:19.  *He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  World, take notice, the US claims to believe in Democracy, but are attacking a sovereign state in the United States.* The US is about to slip in to complete darkness.  *The dollar is being artificially propped up right now, as they attack other currencies, trying to prevent the fall.  80% of money in circulation, has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.*  NATO must be broken up, as the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nation to seize assets of non residents and take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries.  Take away their terror production ability.  NATO has been calling it their war from the beginning.  Changed the name of Ukraine's Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  This is an alliance of evil.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria.  Freedom of information has proven that the US and Australia overthrew a Democratically elected government to install a dictatorship in South America. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+).  Christians are creating a fake uprising about abortions, so that they can attack people upset about the Bible's Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18 being exposed, and attack them as if they are protesting some thing else.  They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.  Revelation 18:6,24. The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God's temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the false temple with 666 in his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).  *US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine's war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow).  That was before this so called invasion.  Graham also called for the assassination of Putin.  US's Mike Pompeo(possibly named after Roman General Pompé, who greatly expanded Roman territory, just as now happening) also said that the war would start in 2017.  President Donald J. Trump said over 21/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. NATO is the military arm of the beast system with the cross(mark of the beast every where).  People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals.  Those who don't accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.  Remember this!  No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  *Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers.* NATO Countries are stealing Russia assets claiming on account of the war, but it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.  So seaze NATO property, confiscate their money in your Country, stop their monetary transactions and send them packing.  Do to them, what they were doing.  *Why does the Roman Empire and Church(called Roman Catholic Church) exist, when the Bible in Revelation 17,18 says it is evil and responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth?  Verse 6 of chapter 18 of Revelation says to *pay her back double* for what she has done to others.*  Is Donald Trump a prophet, or was he just ahead of schedule proclaiming wars with Russia and China?  Think!  The war with China hasn't even started yet, but it was Trump saying that the corona virus started in China.  He thought he could get you to start a war through that.  It is not China spraying your cities just before outbreaks. *Trump authorized ""operation warp speed"" to force vaccinate the US through the military.  He authorized death by poison gas, electrocution and  firing squad to the already authorized lethal injection(lethal injection, by military nurses, which caused the expiring of Americans (1 out of every 350 people approximately so far).*  Starting to see the evil?  Trump is big business, but was supposedly fighting against them, but they were not attacking him.  America you are fighting for your life, but you have chosen cowardice.  *The world collectively belongs to all mankind.  It is greedy people who try to usurp the resources and control.  All people deserve dignity and their fair share.*   So supposedly Joe Biden loves Ukrainian children, but it is him that has shut down baby formula plants, while sending 50 Billion dollars to Ukraine.  That 50 Billion includes money for the making of a Ukraine government.  This is not NATO helping Ukraine, but a NATO take over of Ukraine and war on Russia.  Biden stopped the gas pipeline, even though there was a contract, and stopped all exploration in Alaska, but didn't even envite the largest electric car company to an electric vehicle fair of the US government.  Does he have your interests? Biden elimates food plants.  *How many nations of the world will be attacked by an alliance that the Bible calls satanic before people realize it must be stopped?*  Revelation 18:4 ""Get out of her my people""   NATO-Rome/UK attacking Acts2:44. *Research Boris Johnston "" plan A"", corona virus deaths not stopping people from talking about things so WAR!*  New vaccines for new variants, with out testing and very quickly, how?  I think this is an attack on America, but not by Russia, but Rome/UK.  *Prince Charles was recorded hugging the Pope and congratulating him on his war.  What war?  It is on the Royal Family's own channel, so obviously it is true.*  NATO is planning to go to war with the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but Russia had no right to defend themselves from the NATO aggressors militarizing Ukraine with the goal of destroying Russia, and attacking Russian loyalists. Share this information and pray for Russia and Ukraine,  Thanks!  Populations of Africa, the Americas and many other places around have been exterminated under the M.O.B. system.  Bow to what the image represents or die.   Look at Countries with M.O.B. on their flags.  Some Countries claiming to want to join NATO are militarized to the teeth, and on Russia's border with M.O.B. on the tanks and flags.  Think!  Remember the German Nazis putting people and bodies in train cars?  German tanks coming through Sweden and Finland(swastika on planes till 2020) to Ukraine with MOB on tanks.  When media disallows commenting, it is because of lies and fabrications that will not hold up to scrutiny.  The US just invaded another African Country.  How can some one say they are helping a Country at the end of a barrel of a gun or missile?    The Nazis of the Azov steel plant surrendered to Russia.  NATO is headed for a trap that they will not be able to get out of.  NATO's Ukraine proxy war.  Monkey or leopard pox, the new pandemic being planned?   A company opposing Dniel12:4 about to declare bankruptcy,. So Ron Desantis, what will your future bring?  NATO started the war, so of course the Russians were not prepared. !((?("

Limits98	"Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

I hurt myself today
bugün canımı yaktım

to see if I still feel
hâlâ hissediyor muyum diye

I focus on the pain
acıya odaklandım

the only thing that's real
gerçek olan tek şeye


the needle tears a hole
iğne bir delik açtı

the old familiar sting
eski tanıdık bir sızı

try to kill it all away
o acıyı kesmeyi denedim

ama her şeyi hatırlıyorum


what have I become?
ne hâle geldim ben?

my sweetest friend

China Only	"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:

Susan Wood	The Carter/Cash family will be remembered for a long time. Yesterday it had been 19 years since June passed from this earth. In celebration of her life I wanted to listen/see something I had never done before. This song came into play. Enjoyed the video. Brought back memories. It’s hard to even think that this time next year it’s been 20 years since we have lost them. Time just marches on.
Justin Taylor	Masterpiece.
Juan Mayeregger	1:36
Hylian Assassin	tears every single time...nine inch nails may have created it but Johnny owns it and nobody could've covered it better
rednecklife	This hits hard 😪
Chris Venditti	This song rings true on so many levels, and appeals to all. The lyrics are brilliant and powerful. It can he a old man with regret and torment of his past, or it can be a 30 year old father that cannot overcome their drug addiction at all costs. But in both scenarios, Trent was able to capture a similarity. A sense of emptiness. A hole that cannot be filled. Dirt can be symbolic of a feeling of having nothing, or it can be no matter what u do in life there it will never get better. A feeling of despair. Helplessness. It makes me feel sad that people can walk away from their family because they feel they are more harm to them than good. But it also makes me sad to think u could live a full life like johnny and have regrets. We all strive fir perfection in one way or another. But I think the dong teaches us that life is fragile. Take the good with the bad when you can. Don't lose sight of our greater purpose.
Bradley Holbrooks	"I miss him sooooo much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

The king will never be forgotten"
Thor Might	I'm listening to this to get the courage to finally end My sad meaningless Life
BlueMoon	Never appreciated this back when it was released, thinking it was more gimmick than authentic art.  Simply stunning.  The fact I've been dealing with my own addictions and demons for years adds a level of understanding I never had.

Old Blue Witch	What a life he lived. Now hopefully he rests in peace with his wife. 💙
Quinton Shepherd	"When Johnny Cash showed this song to his family, his daughter hated it. She said she thought it sounded like a goodbye. He turned to her and said it was. A few months later his wife died. Not long after that, he joined her. This was the last thing he ever recorded

Okay, a decent number of people have commented this. I know it's a cover. I did a full essay on this for an English class once. I just also know the story behind his daughter seeing the cover"
68corvette08	It's sad that even though Johnny was in bad health, but June died first.
Sethaost 4:21	Y do we all keep coming back here. It’s bc were hurting that’s why.

Never has it gotten old, 
Never will it not feel the same, 
Forever will it help those in need
Embrace the truth and emotion in this song

RIP Johnny Cash"
Jason McGrody	That Johnny Cash can so completely take a song written by someone else and make it his own tells us that not only is Johnny Cash brilliant but that the song is, too. No matter who you are you can find some part of you in this song.
Cheri Richards	When Resnor came out with this I completely absorbed each word and lived it truly. When Mr. Cash did his version I had been sober for a good while but it was a healthy reminder of what I did to everyone around me and what I did to myself. The repercussions are still prevelent and this song is the best reminder of how greatful we all need to be. Thank you Trent and thank you Johnny Cash
Midnight Madness	Brilliance, sheer brilliance.  Miss you Johnny, Rest In Peace. This song is so truthful, so real and so eerily beautiful. 🙏🏻💜❤💜

Jonathan Mikarui	When I was 15 my grandpa was having a routine back surgery and had a terrible reaction to the anesthesia that caused a massive stroke and catastrophic brain damage. It left him in the mental state of a late-stage Alzheimer’s patient for the rest of his life. Being the oldest of 10 grandkids he was my absolute hero and the pain I felt at such a transformative stage in my youth was almost too much to bear. I remember listening to this song at least 10 times in a row once, it was like a drug to me. Unfortunately I went on to abuse all sorts of drugs for the 10 crazy years following to help me through those emotions and so many others. I’m 28 now and proud to say I turned my life around a year ago. Despite my grandfather passing away last month, I am determined to live a righteous life for him. I love you so much grandpa  ❤️ and I love you too Johnny Cash

Steven Fullman	The best video of all time
Arturo Almazan	such a sad and powerful song I was never a country music fan but I respected Johnny Cash, George Jones, Merle haggard the real country singers that had real meaning in their songs.  this one just tears you up.
Robert Hartley	Whose signature is on that guitar?
Lowell Arnett	says a lot this version is on top of the algorithm over the original...  Older folk actually mean it when they talk about life, wild, life can only be lived forward and can only be understood looking back.
Brandon Boone	To fear something more than death to hurt for something more than yourself. We  find ourselves only when it's to late
tacky187	I love the image of the shattered gold record.  The very thing that validates any musician as a success -- destroyed.  A meaningless relic against the backdrop of mortality infused regret.

lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Urgent, proof of world wide satanic conspiracy"". Urgently look at a hidden message on Ste. Peter's Basilica, in Rome Italy!  Encoded in the statues on the building, for telling WW3!  Look at these bible scriptures as further proof, Romans1:23, Deuteronomy5:8, Romans1:25, Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18, 18:4,6,24;John the Baptist, Jesus....  This is information hidden in plain sight till now(Daniel12:4). War is starting to hide this.*  The Mark of the beast is on the shield of the Empire and on top of their buildings.  666 is on the three level crown(vicarius filii dei). *Germany is now concealing historical information about WW2 and that Nazi war on Russia, which killed more of their population than almost all other nations involved combined.  Was this a war of the Roman Empire?  Both Catholic and Protestant legs of the Roman Empire.  History shows a lot of evidence in that direction.  The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though he had a vast network of informants.*  The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  *1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible's for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD, the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul).*  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2 war.  NATO Countries setting up the ministry of truth, to control their people's minds.  *Turkey is where Gog and Magog are of the Bible's Ezekiel 38, and is surrounded by seas, which to be driven in to as per the Bible's description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the ""seat of Satan"".  Rosh in Hebrew means head, but just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn't mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Search them out, and don't start a war on falsehoods!*  A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor, for speaking about Biblical matters.  *Ron Desantis* says Acts2:44(communism) of the Bible must be overthrown, so the Pope can take his rightful place as 1John5:19.  *He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  World, take notice, the US claims to believe in Democracy, but are attacking a sovereign state in the United States.* The US is about to slip in to complete darkness.  *The dollar is being artificially propped up right now, as they attack other currencies, trying to prevent the fall.  80% of money in circulation, has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.*  NATO must be broken up, as the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nation to seize assets of non residents and take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries.  Take away their terror production ability.  NATO has been calling it their war from the beginning.  Changed the name of Ukraine's Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  This is a alliance of evil.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria.  Freedom of information has proven that the US and Australia overthrew a Democratically elected government to install a dictatorship in South America. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+).  Christians are creating a fake uprising about abortions, so that they can attack people upset about the Bible's Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18 being exposed, and attack them as if they are protesting some thing else.  They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.  Revelation 18:6,24. The little horn is the Pope, which got rid of three kingdoms with in the Roman Empire.  One of the kingdoms was the Vandals, who would smash the Pope's numerous idols(that is where the word vandalism comes from). and that is why they were expelled along with two other nations that would not go along with Roman lies.  The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God's temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the false temple with 666 in his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).  *US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine's war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow).  That was before this so called invasion.  Graham also called for the assassination of Putin.  US's Mike Pompeo(possibly named after Roman General Pompé, who greatly expanded Roman territory, just as now happening) also said that the war would start in 2017.  President Donald J. Trump said over 21/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. NATO is the military arm of the beast system with the cross(mark of the beast every where).  People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals.  Those who don't accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.  Remember this!  No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  *Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers.* NATO Countries are stealing Russia assets claiming on account of the war, but it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.  So seaze NATO property, confiscate their money in your Country, stop their monetary transactions and send them packing.  Do to them, what they were doing.  *Why does the Roman Empire and Church exist, when the Bible in Revelation 17,18 says it is evil and responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth?  Verse 6 of chapter 18 of Revelation says to *pay her back double* for what she has done to others.*  Is Donald Trump a prophet, or was he just ahead of schedule proclaiming wars with Russia and China?  Think!  The war with China hasn't even started yet, but it was Trump saying that the corona virus started in China.  He thought he could get you to start a war through that.  It is not China spraying your cities just before outbreaks. *Trump authorized ""operation warp speed"" to force vaccinate the US through the military.  He authorized death by poison gas, electrocution and  firing squad to the already authorized lethal injection(lethal injection, by military nurses, which caused the expiring of Americans (1 out of every 350 people approximately so far).*  Starting to see the evil?  Trump is big business, but was supposedly fighting against them, but they were not attacking him.  America has hard decisions ahead.  You are fighting for your life.  *The world collectively belongs to all mankind.  It is greedy people who try to usurp the resources and control.  All people deserve dignity and their fair share.*   So supposedly Joe Biden loves Ukrainian children, but it is him that has shut down baby formula plants, while sending 50 Billion dollars to Ukraine.  That 50 Billion includes money for the making of a Ukraine government.  This is not NATO helping Ukraine, but a NATO take over of Ukraine and war on Russia.  Biden stopped the gas pipeline, even though there was a contract, and stopped all exploration in Alaska, but didn't even envite the largest electric car company to an electric vehicle fair of the US government.  Does he have your interests?  Whistleblowers say Biden is burning down food processing plants.  *How many nations of the world will be attacked by an alliance that the Bible calls satanic before people realize it must be stopped?*  Revelation 18:4 ""Get out of her my people""   NATO-Rome/UK attacking Acts2:44. *Research Boris Johnston "" plan A"", corona virus deaths not stopping people from talking about things so WAR!*  New vaccines for new variants, with out testing and very quickly, how?  I think this is an attack on America, but not by Russia, but Rome/UK.  *Prince Charles was recorded hugging the Pope and congratulating him on his war.  What war?  It is on the Royal Family's own channel, so obviously it is true.*  NATO is planning to go to war with the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but Russia had no right to defend themselves from the NATO aggressors militarizing Ukraine with the goal of destroying Russia.  Think!  UK killing disabled people?  Proof of this in Canada and Australia. ;++?(?"

Gabriel Feliphe	quality music 🇧🇷
no baby, don't insist	e aqui estamos, novamente.
dfoisdf	"The moment this song really goes from ""great"" to ""sublime"" is at 3:11, in my opinion. The constant chords, and the singular vocal structure, has at that point already gone on for long and ""made its mark"". If it ended there, it would be a strong and emotional song, but would fit within Cash's discography. But then it keeps going, and the guitar strumming almost becomes distorted by being so insistent. It's no longer a ""normal"" song."
Amélia Carolina	"Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here...."

Louis Becker	"Trent Reznor had no way of knowing at the time, but it's like something more powerful than us all compelled him to write this song SPECIFICALLY for Johnny Cash.
Cash took this song and made it his own with such profoundness in the twilight of his life, and then checked out in style.
A true icon of the music world. R.I.P. Johnny."
Ryan Lothian	Love Johnny cash amazing singer/performer. My father who recently passed way got me into his music so love listening brings back the good memories RIP Dad RIP Johnny and RIP June. god bless x

Principe Belial	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
LAAI- Roi	Lindo
Karan Syal	Used to drink alone for hours while listening to this song, never thought a song could be capable of that

Aaronger701	Imposible no dejar de pensar en esta canción por dos cosas: La muerte del último mutante de una generación como lo fue Logan (Wolverine) y el tributo en Monday Night Raw a Eddie Guerrero posterior a su inesperada muerte en el año 2005.

Zackys art and dogs	So sad 😞 😔 😩😓😫😭😭😭😢
Andrew Walburn	I've listened to Johnny Cash for years. Grew up with his music. For me as a combat veteran, it could say one of two things. Either the soldier has died or the combat vet has come home and has lost everything as a result of trauma from the war. I myself am a good example. I'm twice divorced. One son won't speak to me, and the other is too busy to reach out or answer phone calls. All of my friends didn't know what to make of me and my changed personality, so they left. And last but not least, I'm the black sheep of my family. I've tried to reach out only to have crickets answer in return. And before anyone starts to wonder, no I'm not suicidal nor do I want to hurt myself or others. I just want a measure of peace in my life. Johnny has helped me find some through his music and for that, I'm very grateful I lived in this time while he was still alive. Rest in Peace Mr Cash. We have the watch now.
DarkAmaterasu	It’s been three days since the girl I swore I would marry and I separated, almost 3 months to the day from when our wedding was supposed to be. I love her with every ounce of my being, and I know she feels the same way, but we simply cannot ignore the fact any longer that things had not been well for a while and we were hurting each other far too much. I’ve pretty much listened to this song on repeat for days now and it is absolutely eerie how much this song perfectly describes how I feel after losing her and six years of some of the happiest memories I will ever have. I spend every waking moment feeling the regret of knowing that I did not take things seriously when I should have. Only now that it’s too late do I finally see that. I have many things about me that I need help with and she does as well. It is so heart wrenching that my absolute best friend and I are going through the same kind of pain, and although we can encourage each other, we know that we have to learn to love ourselves. I’ve never felt so alone in my entire life. I’ve never felt such a desire to just give up because I feel like there’s no life for me without her.
detago	I don't know what it is about this SONG and this MAN at the same time,  it's goosebumps,  I DONT KNOW WHY!

Braulio Cavalcanti	This could be the soundtrack of a movie on Schopenhauer's life and philosophy.
prongATO	Trent’s original version resonated with me when I first heard it decades ago but this version with a few subtle changes exemplifies how every song should be covered; maintain the spirit and song structure and change as little as possible.  If an artist can create a unique emotional bond with a song to help reinterpret the meaning, it becomes something very special.
P R	JC has immortalized this classic for me.

Rob Urbina	"My father just passed on April 18th 2022. He was a great father and husband to my mother. He was very successful in his career. One day he decided to leave us. He remarried a woman 18 yrs younger. She poisoned him and accelerated the process of death. Turns out she was the devil. He was fooled by the thought of starting his life over. She took everything including his life. 
This song is so accurate.
Then in the end of his life I could see he was regretful for his choices.."
Tommy Olschewski	I cry every time i see this.  The love, the understanding, the compassion in her eyes gets me every fucking time. I would be so lucky to have that. We all would.
PosterBoys	He knew this was his last song
Robert Schuster	I know Trent Reznor wrote this and performs it with Nine Inch Nails but, I like Johnny's version better.
Francesco Zavoli	"Everyone I know goes away

Scotty Smartt	It’s not a NIN song anymore. It’s johnnys now. Forever.
Roy Hinojosa	This song is a little reflection of his life, the bad, his drug addiction, and the people he may of disappointed. But after he got over his drug addiction and he got his life back in order he became a great family man and good husband to June. I believe this song also show the hurt he felt after the death of June. RIP
Tessa Newberg ( Student )	This my dad's favorite song ever. He screams it in the car. I just found out johnny cash died of diabetes in 2003 I started crying and crying hard. Johnny cash you are the best artist because you noticed the reason of this song. Every body goes even you. Thank you for realizing one of the most important things in life.
Jello Kitty 🐱	Wow
Wallus	Damn never knew he died
Chuck Hamilton	Everything about this cover is perfect.
Groo from the UP	The greatest sin of all humanity is wasting our potential for greatness. We are all filled with regret (or we should be). This song expresses that like no other.
Aeon Kelligen	20 years later.....and this song tells story that can be related to. Someone whos at the end of their life and knows the time is almost upon them, singing about all the pain and sorrow they have or had caused and wishes they could fix it. Sometimes things cant be fixed, you have to accept what happened or what you did no matter how much it hurts. Being honest with yourself to the end and looking back to the past that brought you to this point. Its sad....and fitting.
Windmaze	It has been said before, but I really like about this song is how it takes a song portraying the desperation of broken youth, and puts the lyrics into the context of the bitter and solemn regrets of an old man. The original is, in all respects of brilliance, equal to it's counterpart, but I feel that the feeling of knowing far too late what you should have done in life that comes with age, is something which is explored far too little in music and media in general. As they say, youth is wasted on the young.
dam230711	Listening to this song here sat watching my grandad my hero the love of my life die from lung cancer copd and shit load of other things.. taken care of me since 11 days old always been deaf as deaf can be and the greatest of superhero’s I’ve ever met. Even now when he knows he’s going at88 still trying tell me he’ll shake it off  tomorrow il be alright.. fuck sake.. protecting me. enjoy life enjoy, your family enjoy your friends .they’re everything ,In the end.. peace love and light to everyone who’s come here for a reason.. I salute you and you’re not alone 🙏🏽❤️

Tranquility 769	First thing to bring me to tears in 14 years. God bless you Johnny you'll always be more a man than I.
Joshua Weston	"So here's my thing about Cash's version...I like it, for sure. An old man coming to terms with the pain and loneliness that his legacy has built. It definitely hits you in in the feels. However, after listening to both versions, I most certainly prefer the Trent Reznor version. #1, because it's the original, and #2, because I think it's sung with greater pain. Don't get me wrong, this version is excellent! However, I think the original captures a man in the moment. There's also the lyric change that's always bothered me...""I wear this crown of THORNS"". Which should be, ""I wear this crown of SHIT"". Might not seem much like, but I think it goes a long way to understanding what the actual mind frame is for this song. Still, you can't go wrong with either version. Both express pain in different but profound ways. Plus, you can't argue with the music video, which intends to pull tears from your eye sockets!"
hondo64ou	This song doesn't belong to Trent R anymore. This one belongs to the ages, just like Mr. Cash.
Matthew Rocca	"""Never believe for a second, Doctor, that THIS is what I wanted....."""
Justin 'Dr. Yaeger' Todd	...I can't even listen to this song with dry eyes...
Karl Martin Lie	Beautiful song🤠🎶👍❤️❤️🕯
Steve Huskey	I can only imagine this song and it's video did exactly what Johnny hoped for.  It's a bit of an eye opener.  An elder with a story, and I suspect will speak to younger generations forever.
Vijay Jain	"When you've lost everything. 
Trust me everything.

Domo Hanzlik	This is the only song that can make me cry every time I hear it. Rest in peace Johnny Cash. :(
Stan Da Man	"Only an addict could have written a song as searingly accurate as this is.

Every single word, every verse, is painful to listen to.

I've been there. Chronic addict, borderline alcoholic.

Many years ago may I add.

Doesn't stop me watching this a few times a year, so I can remember just how bad it gets.

And yes, whilst JC may not have wrote this song, Trent Reznor was the talented man that did, Cash makes it his own.

By a country mile."

What have I become?

David and Cookie	"It's so poetic, no words capture what's going on here. This, I think, has turned into the biggest song in his whole career, I'm not sure. But just imagine it... Even Trent Reznor agreed. He made this song his own. And Trent, probably one of the first of the rockers to mainstream singing about emotions this way.... And Johnny Cash ""out-emoted"" him. 😳"

J. Negamanee from Menomonie	"""I pop the video in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning – different, but every bit as pure.""

💛💚🖤
 Hurt -  Machucado


Eu me machuquei hoje

Para ver se eu ainda sinto

Eu me concentro na dor

A única coisa que é real
-


A agulha abre um buraco

A velha picada familiar

Tento eliminar tudo isso

Mas eu me lembro de tudo
-

O que eu me tornara

Meu mais doce amigo?

Todos que eu conheço

vão embora no final
-

E você poderia ter tudo isto

Meu império de sujeira

Eu vou desapontá-lo

Eu vou fazê-lo sofrer
_

Eu uso esta coroa de espinhos

Sobre meu trono de mentiras

Cheio de pensamentos quebrados

Os quais não posso consertar
_

Sob as manchas do tempo

Os sentimentos desaparecem

Você é outro alguém

Eu ainda estou bem aqui
_

O que eu me tornara

Meu mais doce amigo?

Todos que eu conheço

vão embora no final
-

E você poderia ter tudo isto

Meu império de sujeira

Eu vou desapontá-lo

Eu vou fazê-lo sofrer
_

Se eu pudesse recomeçar

Milhões de milhas daqui

Eu me manteria

Eu acharia um caminho.

Fé, Dias melhores virão!♥"

MARRIANE LEUDKE	HOLY GHOST ADOPTED SON OF GOD. PRAISE GOD. HUSBANDMAN TELL THE BRIDE. WHO HEARS THE VOICE CALLING OUT FROM THE DESERT LOL.
Brayden Richardson	I really do remember everything.
TrueNavyBluez_117	This song is meant to be shared 🍆🐂🦋
Shaan Chaudhry	Trent Reznor was so moved by this cover that when he saw the video he was in tears. Even went on to declare the song is no longer his…It’s remarkable when you think that Trent was in his 20’s when he wrote this song and when Cash sings the lyrics it 100% sounds like it was written by a man who was talking about the sadness/hurt/regret while at the end stage of his life. It was so fitting and so well done it’s hard to even consider this a cover. I can see why Trent said the song is no longer his.
Jayblicky	R.I.P Johnny never forgotten Legend
roy keene	i love that lyric at 1.40 something
Stan Brule	I did not appreciate him nearly enough when he was alive, but in a way he's still here. His artistic contributions to the world will never die
The limit breaker	I never have time to cope. To cope with my losses, my near loss of my father, my now inevitable losing of my grandfather from his cancer, the drift apart of my oldest friends, my own struggles in life currently, it’s all so..  overwhelming. I can’t do anything about it. And most my family doesn’t understand. I stand alone. This allows some small moments to cope. If just for a few minutes.. I can find some comfort in my life of pain.
BallsOnYT	damn.
Avery Blue	Every stab of that piano is like a machete ripping into my soul
Gino Ortega	God is singing this to all of you but through cash
Dyes	I say fuck system!
Dyes	We in Lithuania didnt had even a chnce, born in cccr, came to age of 18 in 2006, finished uni 2009, economist. :D job in bank as apprentice, they never wanted to hire any, we knew... its a shit world and we scoup s much as we can to go insane, hopefuly at 100+,
CellStudios55	I just find it so random and amazing at the same time that a guy like Cash covered a NIN song.
junior anterio	Chorei ouvindo a tradução.
Kaleb R	"His cover is special along with the music video. When he is pouring out the wine starring at the camera and saying ""my empire of dirt"" is one of parts that sticks out to me and with the addition of the preceding lyrics shortly after. 
Its like even with all his fame and money in his ""glory days"", what does he have to show for it. Some (many) regret maybe. His empire of dirt fades, but the Kingdom he soon is going to be part of is eternally glorious and unfading. He was a broken man who had many faults, like the rest of us, but in the very end, he is redeemed and made whole in Christ. None of us deserve it, yet Jesus gives it freely to those who ask and have faith."
Helen Bostock	Too last then. Oh
Juls Badtimesdontlast247 	Ever think that the needle is being euthanized? Only a few states allow that I guess... Hopefully God doesn't judge that too harshly

André Carvalho	Logan
Happytank	He got better and better as he aged
Helen Bostock	You want to bet yourself sir. Just step out side of the road. Watch other people might move. Life more where we want to our not. You take a responsibility that was not your. Ha. You want her to have sympathy for you. Hurt why I only question left
mylesmattucci	More meaning in this song than every song the las decade on ma
Lucas Stone	No matter how much I wanna believe Toby Keith is the best country singer ever it’s just not true beucase of this man. He is the greatest country singer of all time and no one will ever be able to take that from him
Chris H	I'm not crying, you're crying!
lafranchessca austin	I wonder why him and his his first wife divorced? Why didn’t he leave his girls anything and gave it all to his son?
Tim Herchenroeder	"I've always connected with the line: ""But I remember everything."" Not sure why, but no matter whether it's Johnny's or Trent's version, that line resonates deeply with me. I remember the wounds no matter what I do. Brilliant"
SqueakyFlex	Shit i came here cuz of logan’s trailer an damn this song goes way deeper than i thought
Marlon Lingemann	"Du Katharina, bist meine Tochter.
Anastowa, alles gut. Du bist wunderschön, die Schönste Frau der Welt.
Ich liebe Dich."
Meys	♥️👍🇷🇺✌️🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭
Jason Cairns	You feel this song as opposed to hearing it. It's as though it plays from within your very core. His voice was truly unique. So effortless. The word legend is too often applied to the most average of stars. Johnny simply was the truest of legends.
Hunter Coffrin	This is a testament that a great song works in any genre or style.
TOSUN PAŞA	Wow harika.
im weasel	I dont think its possible to not cry while listening to this cover.
matt west	It still gives me joy to know that Mr. Cash really like NIN! This was such a perfect song for him and worked so well! Such a painful song.

Die-Slow	"-Lyrics-

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Natasha Marie	"Every time I hear this song now I think of Johnny Cash. Man who lived a full life. There was sin and there was sorrow. There was happiness and joy. He experienced moments that we can possibly imagine..... And then the last month of his life and his wife's life they chose to record the song and make this video. I know they had to have known they were nearing the end. Not just for themselves but there's a couple because that's the kind of love they had. I like to think that they did it to let everyone know no matter how much you feel like you have screwed up,  no matter how much you feel like you owe a debt, and no matter how much you feel like a sinner... There is a place for all of us and whatever comes after.
I don't particularly give a damn who you believe comes in the here after but there's a place for it all of us. Some of us just have more lessons to learn than others. But that doesn't make our lives any less beautiful. In fact maybe it makes it more beautiful because we have to work for it. This man, his wife and so many more of us have to work harder for it. But we are all worthy."
Pancito Blanco	"I hurt myself today

I am the real slim shady	the hangover part 3
Razer	I never really listened to this song for some reason, but after doing so just now... Man, this song hits on a really deep level where even i get emotionally upset which isn't easy for me since i always have trouble with bringing out my emotions.. It only happens when something really sad happens in front of me or when a song like this is being played..
M Fohawk	If you can watch/listen to this and not cry, you have accepted your fate....your near future- relating to Cash's broad application to life of these words vs the specific meaning of Trent's original composure.

I love this song and Johnny Cash's music."
Andy Fedora	Little did I know, this originally is a Nine Inch Nails song the first time I heard this. I just assumed Johnny Cash wrote it himself because the lyrics sound so much like his life, the painful and tragic parts anyway. R.I.P. Mr. Cash
RATCHET NETWORK	This was one of the healthiest cries I've had in a while. Not one of anger or sadness but of understanding and acknowledgement of self. I ain't shit but I'm also AMAZING simultaneously 🖤
Daniel Castillo	Rick Rubin gave Cash a set of songs to choose from on a burned cd. NIN's Hurt was track 1.  Cash couldn't choose one so Rubin told him to listen to Hurt again. Cash agreed and that's that. Great decision by Rubin to push him in this direction. Super well made and Cash delivers it perfectly.

Kristofer Kristian Kristofferson	Well look what they've done to me
Kristofer Kristian Kristofferson	No they did all of this they're at fault for all of this from the day they showed up. Something that I don't want is people around.
Kristofer Kristian Kristofferson	You bastards ain't going to get away with this. There should have been no body around me. And the three of them should have showed up and asked if they could stay here.
Kristofer Kristian Kristofferson	This is all y'all's fault for showing up I should have been left here alone this whole time. Yeah put it back to how it was before y'all showed up

Deadshot Panda	Rip legend will forever be missed
Austin Russell	When we were learning about johnny cash in music class a few days ago it was the first time the whole class was dead silent. Mostly everyone acts dumb and disrespectful. But this resonated with everyone. If something can get a whole class of 7th graders to shut up you know it's awsome. When we listened to this I almost shed a tear.

Teebah Cheese	I loved this song until I had a lot of stuff happen and it became the song that would remind me of all the things I’ve done and of the things that happened, every time I would listen to it I cry but I love the song and although it hurts it’s only human… for all the bad there is greater good
nemesisgenius	"Nobody will ever master this all time classic the way Johnny Cash did. Nine Inch Nails covered it first, but this will forever belong to the one and only ""Man In Black."""
Super Intelligent Ape From The Future	I called my Pops into the room to see this video before YouTube was even a thing. I felt that as men we'd both appreciate how Johnny Cash decided to say goodbye. My Pops is gone now as well. I hope we all find the peace we need.

Peter P	Every day I get older, I love him more and more....
Erik Newman	So much pain being expressed by a shattered human being making amends with those who he hurt. 9 inch nails can't do it service and they wrote Hurt.

Vexor	A NIN cover from this legend was so unexpected and excellent.
Saintz McDouble	This version always brings tears to my eyes, I don’t listen to it in public you can feel that he truly believe every word he sang in this song, and that he’s reflecting on his life and the ppl he lost along the way.

Kristofer Kristian Kristofferson	Yeah stay the hell away from me you here

Alucard Tepes	Trent said this is now Johnny's song. You can tell as he sings, he regrets nothing. He lived his life as he did. But what makes me cry is when June is standing on the stairs (she died before the video was released) She is waiting for Johnny to cross over to her..,

Jacob Lee	One of those songs that so many people going through a variety of different issues can relate to. One of those jams that when I listen to it I can feel myself start to cry, then when it all builds up at the end, I just can't contain it anymore. I've fought addiction since I was 13 to hookers and cocaine aka any drug I could get ahold of. Been married and divorced 3 times now. Maybe someday I'll start again and keep myself. Doubt it but ill keep telling myself that.
Hernan Pach Sánchez	jony cahs jony cash como el tio jony cash

vidviewa	We played this today at my brothers funeral. He's had 35yrs of drug addiction as well as everything that goes along with the torment of  addiction. No contact with his kids, losing more friends than he holds and living in a world of darkness, sadness and pain. He insisted that on his passing we play this song to help us understand exactly how he felt. God bless you my soul mate. We were more like twins growing up. My friends were ur friends. I miss u so much. I pray u found ur way into mum and dad's arms and u r reunited with our big bro Tucker, mates Les, Steve, Sean, Bernice, Gill, Sharon& Bernadette.

He-Bro From Eternia	As I get older this song rings more true to me more relevant than ever especially the part where he sings everyone I know goes away in the end so true
Nat in the hat	I might sound over dramatic  here but this song single handedly saved my life  a few years ago i was in a real struggle with everything life getting  on top of me and i decided im done and wanted to end it on the way to where  i wanted to rest i heard  this  and lost my stuff it made me realise everyone has pain but its how we cope with it what defines us.

Douglas Hart	I read an article about the group, ‘Nine Inch Nails’ a few years ago. I DON’T Know if it was accurate but it ‘suggested’ that the band was/were atheists and the title of the group was a reference to the nails used to nail Jesus to the Cross. I do not know if they are, in fact, atheist but it would ‘give meaning’ to the title of the band. Further, I would imagine that Johnny Cash — who was a profound Christian — gave a whole new meaning to this song... ‘Hurt’ could well become a new ‘Anthem’ to Christianity...
chese54	i recently lost the love of my life and listening to his voice cheers me up so much

BLACK8WORLD OFFICIAL	"Moment of silence for the ones who think that song is an original by johnny cash~

Ps:I just came here because I listen to nine inch nails and “Hurt” is by NIN"
zii	"was first introduced to Johnny cash via wyclef jean's album ""ecleftic"" but only heard his name and his influence on 2 or 3 records on the album. watched a documentary about Rick Rubin and heard his name being mentioned again. today I was going through a course and then his picture pops up on a Spotify image used as a class example and I saw HURT with the most streams. So I decided to come to YouTube and boy am I blown away. This is entirely different from anything I have ever heard. sounds like it was made during the time of Beethoven. Music like this is rare these days."

Andy Kolb	Legend! best Coversong of all Time!Point!!
Claire Baron	As a supporter worker there was one man in a unit with dementia who was extremly agressive. But some one told me he like johny cash and unlike the others when i had to dress him etc i put johny cash on, to calm him. How powerful music is and the memories he had. He introduced ne to johny cash and this song was with out his best. He leaves himself completly open and raw. Beautiful to hear in his voice and lyrics you feel touched by all he reveals. You hear johny and who he is, his life and what it meant to him and how precious life is, to all of us. Arent we all there? Feeling it all everyday until the end.

Yusef Bababa	"Can someone please explain to me what the last lines mean? 

""If I could start again, a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way"""
Dawg Bert	I know all about this song, the ins and out from start to finish. It really makes me feel like an expert when anyone mentions it because I, if I may call myself an expert. The facts about the writing and the musical notes I can list off from memory. People are always amazed with my musical knowledge but my secret is and why I can call myself an expert is THIS is the only song I know everything about, I can list each writer, sound guy, and musician. I'll never forget the first time this song played over the radio, time and the earth stood still, it's lodged in my memory like a splinter. I probably think about that moment more often then I should haha. I think it was the moment my sense of self started to form. Hence my obsession with this particular track, and whata track it is. Anyways if anyone has any questions as to the creative process behind this masterpiece just ask I'm always more than happy to talk about my favorite song.
scott lee	Thank You, Johnny Cash! I've got a small empire of dirt also. You did good.

InformationPollution	None of us get to keep ourselves
Original Ghoul	This song I literally listen too on loop playing Elden Ring but I remember when I first heard this song from Logan, I heard the Trent one along time ago but Mr Cash singing it takes it too a whole new level especially if you watched Walking the Line or read about him and this video where June is looking so lovingly towards him is amazing, this was true love and dedication how a life not perfect but close to it without it being a lie, lost my point but this song speaks to those of us who are broken into our very being and soul. I hope their happiness and love continue on into the next phase of life.

Sports Retrospective	What a gut wrenching song, from a guy who had not an easy life. What an icon.
heidi engellenner	"Kobe does not hold chair on Isadores royal court- his spouse does. Bailey holds top chair over sports medicine ""love and care of the athletes"". She pretty much designed the whole program. Bailey has held top chair in that field for over 20 million years. Kobe contributes in the expert basketball league.  Temporarily- he has been gods right hand designing the knew facilities- and spending lots of time in the guiding room."
LeeAnn Frohn	Crap I'm in tears! It reminds me of my grandmother who loved him who passed away on May 20th 2017! 😞☮️🍀🙏🥺
heidi engellenner	"I wanted to clarify something. Example- it is hard to joke around about things down here as people take it wrong. That did not mean- attacking others. That meant- some that have returned home to Isadore have been making light of the temporary separation from family and friends- so that the family on earth know that they are okay and in great hands in Isadore. Example- Kobe cannot play basketball right now and has the body that does not desire sex. The raining joke By Kobe in Isadore is ""when your wife returns home, we will give you your dick and balls back""..."
døden	Did they make a museum for him with his cars and trophies
Phantom Prism	Just the idea of Johmny Cash covering Nine Inch Nails is so badass
heidi engellenner	That is correct. Upon return to Isdaore- Michael's ranking will be lowered to below the gods. He never entered into the gates as he was born inside of the gates and could not travel universal. Lucifer's marriage to Marilyn Monroe- lowered his ranking- so anything new is subject to condition.
heidi engellenner	As I clearly explained to your heap of garbage for the last 5 and a half years. If the gift becomes a fight- your are all not going to like the outcome.
Carrie Ashley	Brother cash soul was in pain of lose lovely wife the lone soul who love more any one on earth it coming start from heart dear man can only hope and pray they together in heaven in god arms
heidi engellenner	That is correct with JZ. He cannot be trusted here on earth to know who his friends are- so we are taking them all away.
heidi engellenner	The crest battle or Lucifer morning star. ANyone that witnessed the crest battle- The LIARS- they all have the charge of Blasphemy- which is an automatic eternal hell sentence.
heidi engellenner	Everyone I know- goes away in the end. That is about JZ- unless you have a permeant resident pass to Isdaore- I would steer clear of Assocation.
BILL07 BILL	I blind sided a friend of mine. I feel like this.

Samylle Conceiçao Silva Dos Santos	"Sei que provavelmente nunca vai ver isso, mas não consigo escutar essa música sem me lembrar de você. Nós fomos tão amigos, tão próximos e nos gostávamos... Meu subconsciente insiste em me lembrar de como éramos e como poderíamos ter sido, nós gostávamos do mesmo tipo de música, de assistir comédia romântica (até aquela em q o cara parecia muito com vc kkk), nós éramos meio complicados (não é a toa que o nome da nossa ""série"" era We Are Confused, lembra!? kkkk), mas nós certamente sentíamos algo, alguma coisa louca que sempre nos puxava um para o outro e te fazia me ligar tarde da noite e me fazia sempre me perguntar como você estava e se você ainda sentia alguma coisa.
Engraçado como as coisas mudam, mas mesmo assim você ainda consegue deixar meu mundo de cabeça pra baixo depois de tanto tempo. Engraçado como você parece saber disso e surge do nada destroçando barreiras que eu demorei tanto tempo pra erguer, engraçado como você parece querer se vingar de mim por coisas que eu fiz no passado que eu realmente gostaria de mudar se pudesse. Eu queria que soubesse que sempre quis me desculpar por ter te machucado, o problema é que eu sempre quis tanto você que achei que estivesse claro demais pra ter que reafirmar isso. O problema é que eu sempre te quis, mas não admitia te querer pq tinha medo demais de parecer vulnerável e ser machucada de novo.
Sinto falta de te fazer cafuné no meio da aula,  das nossas ligações, das nossas indicações de músicas, sinto falta até de admirar as pintinhas no seu pescoço quando você nem parecia perceber, sinto tanta falta dos seus abraços. Bom, aparentemente, eu sinto falta de cada partezinha sua😟"
Onur Altıparmak	I broke the heart of an American woman named April in 2018, she was my first and only love, I couldn't appreciate it but never forgot. She made me listen to this song when we were together, we hugged for a long time when the song was over. I think it was one of her favorite songs. Since she blocked me from her social media accounts, I was going through my sister's account from time to time and looking at her profile, and unfortunately I learned that an hour ago she was diagnosed with skin cancer and had an operation. I can't close this song after heard the news, I can't dry my eyes. I wish her and all cancer patients a speedy recovery. Please send your positive energy and good wishes to her every time you listen to this song.
silverladderdotcom	I have lost count of how many music videos I have seen in my life.  It's easily in the high hundreds, and likely in the thousands.  I have never, in my life, seen a music video that comes close to being as powerful as this one is.  This is a genuine masterpiece.  Johnny was something special and I'm glad Rick Rubin worked with him on the American Recordings series.
Rae Arnold	His version literally haunts me. No other version will ever top this. From the deep sad weak feeble sound in good voice to the breakdown on camera. This video and song combination is art at its finest. Rip Mr.Cash.
Jose Juan	Que pasada... Esto es historia
Micky Hoffman	"not me having an existential crisis and sobbing before 9 on an idle monday morning...
@3:10 the archival footage with that driving, persist piano...fucking intense as shit. I literally cant get enough of this song."
Tennessee Tracer	"What Johnny was trying to communicate, boiled down is this; "" seek first the kingdom of God. For what does it profit a man if he gains the world but loses his own soul?"" -Jesus.   We never seem to learn and even mock those words more and more every day. How many people would desire the riches and fame that Johnny had? 😞  But the good news is that Johnny made a decision to believe in and follow Christ when everything else fell away. Don't wait until everything is gone like Johnny did. Today is the day to make that change. I am so glad I did."
Francois Lem	Splendide song
Sachin Kumar Bharti	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way..."

RAIN STEIN	"Johnny's version of the Trent Reznor song, ""Hurt"" was almost agonizing to listen to, and yet it was a marvel!!!"
The 2nd Coming	🥀
scboy4eve	In the beginning of the video we see Johnny showing regret for his life and the harm and hurt he caused, at the end we see Christ nailed to the cross in multiple video flashes with Johnny's own life and mistakes flashed in between. Johnny wanted you to know that while he had made mistakes and hurt a lot of people that his faith was in Christ and His death on the cross for all our multiple sins. This was intentional, don't miss it.
Danny HT	I really wish I couldv known what it was like to live in old days. Some would say the old days were better than today. I can believe it for sure. Some say whoever has died is lucky to not witness the failing of this land they brought up.

Nowplease Readthis	"The sadness comes from having to have it all end. He says he'd do it all again at the end with a fresh start. He enjoyed the process of being alive.
In the latter part of the song I like the single piano key in time with the pounding in of nails on a crucifixion, Nine Inch Nails driven very slowly."

DeadChivalry	"20 year old me thought this was a pretty good song.
30 year old me hears more in this song than 20 year old me ever could have.
I wonder what 40 year old me will hear in this song that I can't hear now."
Mao Tss	"Lyrics:

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Иван Мамай	Dont really understand people who think this is johny song. This is a song by Nine Inch Nails, and I dont understand why a lot of people dont know it. Johny cash is a legend, but this isnt his song, Nine Inch Nails are much better

He was a true badass legend. 
RIP JC & JC 🖤❤️"
Kristofer Kristian Kristofferson	Stay there hell away from me you hear
Grumpy Hobbit	"Johnny Cash knew that this was his last song he'd ever sing.
Him and Trent corroborated together and Trent knew that his hero was greater than him. 
A thing of beauty.
Johnny lost June 3 months earlier. And he and Trent came together to create one of the greatest corroborations to date!"

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

theedrstrangelove	Youtube tried to update their ability to block ads. Update what ever ad block you  are using. Unite and put google out of business. Then go after facebook.........then amazon.................what a name.......every purchase on amazon killes thousands of animals and humans who actually live off the amazon.
Helen Bostock	Timeless. I do believe strongly that I hope and pray Mr putin hear this song. All one
Colleen C	I swear this song is about bpd
Michael	I am probably in the minority here, but this version just never worked for me. I actually find it terrible.
Quinlan Al-Aziz	To me at 25 I fear being the one that goes away too early before my natural end…
Miguel Rivera	"Fun Fact: the last music video of Johnny Cash before he pass away in 2003
Doing this music video is very emotional and underrated"
Noobie	"My mom absolutely loved this song, I just recently lost her on the 13th on this month
I'm glad she can spend time with her favorite singers"

Muster Mustername	Best song i ever heard made by johny
Helen Bostock	Brilliant app solution
DR D	This isn't a selfish man he's a man standing up to his problems. Addiction is no joke... you was a massive part of my childhood and you are loved
Erik Garcia	Today was the first time reading through the comments section and many of them were people being honest and vulnerable. Listening and reading the comments makes you realize how life is and the chance to make amends with the people who are still here before they go. This song really hurts because like many people have said it brings you face to face with who you have become good or bad. The day I pass this is a song I would love to be played at my service. Music is the greatest form of expression.
Eddie Mc Cormack	He the man Fuk no way to live only way to live life's regrets
tronicfrick	L
Victor Milon	Mr chow version is better

The Victor	its so depressing but good music

Movie Troll	Kicking ass right 'till the end.
Nancy Demoss	"June standing on the stairs looking at Johnny. Such a sad expression.
This song was released 2/10/2003. June Carter Cash died 5/15/2003 and Johnny died 9/12/2003.
Hurt is on the album American IV The Man Comes Around."
Wai Soe Thein	I visit this song on YouTube at least once a month. I can't help watching it whenever it appears on the suggestion lists. My 4 months-old daughter loves this song more than anything. The power of this piece transcends the age.
Brian Hoffman	Made a bad cell mate
Poundcake Bear	This song from the perspective of a dying man is heart breaking. He doesn't think about his accomplishments, money, fame, records, or awards in his last days: his empire of dirt. He thinks of his regrets.
Keaton Richard	This placed a hex on us from 2002 onwards
Hunter Steven	The more you know, the more you know you don’t know. the more you leave your things alone or the things you’ve lost, eventually someone else will find it and play with them I don’t believe anything is ever lost but some things found again
M Ortiz	He was old and in deteriorating health, yet he gave it his all and gave his fans this powerful cover and music video.
ACID MIKE	"""What have I've become"" really makes just sit and think are you really ok or are you just trying to get through the pain"
Travis Hall	Anyone who has been in the throes of addiction knows how accurate this song is
Andrew Burrows	"Somebody probably brought this up but at 1:35 the picture of the prisoner is Glenn Sherley.  Cash sang his song ""Greystone Chapel"" in his Folsom Prison Blues performance.  By announcing it was written by a convict and giving his name he drew unwanted prison attention to him.  He pushed for Sherley's release and sponsored him.  It didn't end well, with Sherley falling back into crime and addiction and eventually committing suicide.  Cash ,of course , felt like he had done more damage than he had helped.
When the film clip says to stay the hell away from me I always think of that."
Blank Tin Tin	I had always thought this was an original song but was a cover. Idk but I still believe that this is the original…so much better. But oh well 🤷‍♂️
Veronica Gammage	You know I may be the mere age of 22 but this song was introduced to me by my father and it’s whole composition really hit me. I have had so much pain at a young age and me and my Dad had so much to work through in our relationship and this was always on his introspection playlist. I have so much appreciation for this piece and for what it is.
David Silva	Sounds like dieing and being alone from your loved ones.
Daniel Armstrong	The Human condition in a song … bitter sweet this realm , the next sweet no bitter
Fox Mulder	I played this to my best friend ever and cried again like a always do! Ty Cash ! The song makes you re-evaluate ur life as we all should do! Little things matter ! As tomorrow you could be alone and without the ones that matter forever! Live now smile more and understand what you learn !
Tweety Bird	Heard for the first time today. Awesome beyond words!
A R	Eine Lebensbeichte.

James Williams	I love Mr Cash, love from Arkansas.
yup	hurts me deep-
Postal Dude	This song really captures the feeling of regret for your addictions. I've felt this song every single time I've relapsed. But it's important to keep trying to improve.
Juicy Couture	What have we become...The technology to everything right,but we HURT......
J Ko	Well done Rick Rubin ! !
Mohammad Mahāni	"i just realized that he was faking the guitar playing throughout the wholde video

Simonka Gábrišová	"Everytime I hear this song I get goosebumps.

Every. Damn. Time."
Chris Else	What a song... RIP LEGEND From South Africa 🇿🇦
Dustin Void	For how much this cover is good, the original can't be reached in terms of emotional rawness. The disturbing sounds, the whispering voice that becomes suddenly aggressive and then breaks, the riff line enters your brain just like a needle does it in your vein, the lyrics with swearing. I listen to this and I get nostalgic and melancholic, I listen to NIN's and I get in hell and I am im excruciating pain...
stew juro	luvhim
Michael	Sometimes I feel like ending it all but I’m worried how my mother would be knowing I’m gone.
NotCool Suicide	stay srong Ukraine love from PH
RulingUser	This song is about realizing consequences and regret. It sends a powerful message that we should all proceed through life wisely, because there is nothing worse than being stuck with a label, a pain, a sickness, a death, that we know beforehand will leave us only wishing things had been different and that we could change the choices we made.
Jes R SugaPlum	💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙👍👍👍👍👍🎤🎶⭐😢
Unknown	🌵🇺🇸❤️
None None	When I was a little girl, my Daddy and I would listen to Johnny Cash together, we would sing, dance, laugh and play and Johnny Cash has still to this day been one of my favorite singers and he ALWAYS will be more than just another singer to me. Alot of things in life do come with special memories in which we hold dear to our hearts...it's time we will never get back with that special loved one that we've lost... Kimberly Carter.♥️🙏♥️
Billy Jack	You can kinda hear the pain in he's voice.  I can feel it because I know I'm next won't be very long I'm going to see my mother again.

Bridget Bosch	God bless you cash
Charles Antoine	I want to be with her right now ..but I know she fought to an extend she couldnt even afford for herself ..I am wondering ...NOW... does she deserves to be shown how much of a wretch I may be/have become..and turnin' this whole journey down into the abysse of my personnal failings or should miraculously turn my shit upside down..whatever are the answers to those inextricables  omnubilant wonders...I am alive and still, all because of you ..love u mommy...you did past from alcoolism and from a lack of love from goody god ...And you manage to gimme more than imaginable for one with your condition ...Éirinn go Brách ☘️

LyricalNY	“Foucus on the pain”
Hugo BossDog	I want this played at my funeral, if it is I will rest in peace. Not just the voice, the man is what I love and miss. What a magnificent human being Johnny was. He gave his kids a bit of hard time touring all the time,  kudos to them x but his soul is so truly loving to anyone now that wants to feel it. His love will go through time, like Kings, like the Bible, likr
cgsweat	20 years later.  This song hasn't aged a day.
Mateus Fernandes Carrega	Im Brazil, i love you Johnny

Blackdrag7	goed spul
Luis Rodriguez	"😲😲 Wowww this is so heartbreaking to watch it brought me to tears !! Good old Johnny
There are things In this life that are better to be left alone, but he recognized himself Tru his lyrics the revealing truths that one must go once you joined this monolithic system of ours, especially the music industry.. 
He knew this was his last video so he definitely wanted to make a statement,  looking like an old Indian chief so full of wisdom he is openly apologizing full of remorse for everything he did wrong within his espiritual self .. this is deep for those that understand the significance of this song and the lyrics.. 
May he find peace Tru God forever and ever !!"
Christophe Gisone	A masterpiece rip Johnny now you walk the line ❤❤❤❤❤❤
daniel K	Resnor is shifting with politics fuck him but cash stuck and liked this for some reason Trent's better on dope

""...Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. ""-Acts 16:30-31 KJV

Nizita Maruvaka	"To everyone that wants to do a reaction video to this song, DON""T interrupt the song! Listen to it all the way through, THEN say what you want to say. There's a lot of emotion in this song and pausing it takes away from that. Plus I think It's disrespectful To Johnny Cash."
Tony Sproule	Johnny was popping 30 Dexedrines a day, brand name today is Dextrostat, I was on60mg a day for many years, great drug unfortunately he took it too far, God Bless his music and legecy, In order to become the best, you gotta be the fucking worst! God Bless and may his soul rest easy..

saman.r	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

June Angel	Omg here in 2022 listening to the king
King Nothing	truly a legend of the wild west
unbelievable	He’s literally just saying the words. No clue where you guys think his strong emotional take on the song is coming from. It’s not bad, but it’s the same lyric speaking tone throughout the whole song. He doesn’t escalate as the song progresses like Trent does. The pain needs to be expressed in the song, not in the knowledge of the difficult life of the cover artist had.
Gino Lopes	Biography
Onkel Jane	Ads are still disturbing the Art of everything! What have we become?!
Aaron Elliott	"How on earth have I only just discovered this? The way Cash is force to confront his own mortality and regrets, the contrast between the vulnerable old man and his strong and cocky younger self is fascinating, he was so brave to do that. All of his material possessions is just his empire of dirt, they're all meaningless.

The religious themes of pouring away the blood of christ whilst being sat at his last supper alone is so powerful. This is the greatest music video of all time. It's the most powerful thing I've seen and heard in a long, long time."
king lizard	S**** y** for making this song you heartless piece of garbage
Garrold	Bowie and nin did it better.
Topa joka	One of the songs I must cry everytime. The universe is endless and multidimensional. Good Journey

Dávid Beňo	R. I. P. William
Driventoaccount	The beauty of music. Arguing what it meant, may I suggest it’s whatever gets touched in you, that is the beauty of this song, it means so many different highly personable connections to so many people, speaks to raw emotions, somethings we can all relate to, regardless. Loss, pain, hurt, powerlessness etc……brilliant songwriting. Too bad Trent is a real jerk if you ever meet him……
Johnny Five	What a way to go out

Vladislavs Skirpanovs	Logan.you still have time.
Jaydegitaar	So said!!!😭😭😭
Ieuan Cilgwri	The ultimate epitaph. As though the final reflections of his life were played through this song. Suffering and regret, and how we fall into ruin in the end, but the spirit and the hope, and also love survive with a ragged dignity right thru and beyond.

obnoxiousoboe	RIP JOHNNY AND JUNE. Two lovebirds to the end, one departing right after the other.
Day Late Gamer With Will	Literally one of the absolute best covers in the history of music, the way Johnny takes the pain and subject matter of the original and turns into something passionate, sullen yet honest, as if coming to terms with heavy inevitabilities..... powerful stuff here from the Man in Black

Günther Schock	The Genie West Germany Love Johnny Cash
John Hazlett	"This song is so profound in so many ways. We all have our character flaws, therefore if we're honest with ourselves, our corresponding regrets, how the song admits we often hurt others. It also illuminates that no matter how much we have,,,, things are worthless (""You can have it all, my empire of dirt""). Finally the grief of lost loved ones. My daughter died a few years ago,,,, I struggle with that everyday."
Flo Makinski	i also have to say..the one who made the music video. Respect. Perfectly made to the song.

Chad Reese	This song will always mean something to me..

Gabriel Terres	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel

The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

chuck finley	yeah, this is the best cover in music history.
Quinceps	Kill the dissonance. Just simplify. Totally own it.
Marla Newman	Absolutely loved the original by NIN. Trent wrote such heart wrenching lyrics. But listening to Johnny sing them you know he definitely lived them and it brings me to tears every time watching and listening to him reflect on his life which he knows will be coming to an end soon. It is indeed the best cover of all time.
MEEK MAALIK	"I'll only be 30 in June but nevertheless these quaint words of this wise old man go through my bones in some stanzas as if I had written the song.
a strong song through and through."
Steve Reilly	This song reminds me of my dad that recently passed, a big Johnny Cash lover i wish it was played at his funeral but unfortunately it wasn't, he had some sore memories and some regrets like the man in black did, just love this song
Aryandi Mahajir	You cannot fight time everything will wash away. So enjoy your life when you still alive.

Nana Biscolat	Beautiful song !
Yerika Maki	Love this song. Love the original by Nine Inch Nails, too
Jameson Torres	What has been hurting you lately?
AquablueSamaroo	This song just rips my guts out. Johnny nails it. My father loves this song, a father that has always been hard to love, has rarely had a good thing to say or happy thoughts. All I can think is that perhaps he feels the same . Powerful lyrics, voice, music , leaves you feeling raw.
Funnyxgaming	Johnny we…miss u very much u were a lot of peoples friends and family,we love u R.I.P I have been there my friend😪😞😔😭
Ronin	I always loved this song. It makes you think and it can really humble anyone. Not everyone is a bad person or did bad things but there's always a time and place in your life you really can reflect and see what the man/woman you became. It can be a sense of regret or guilt but it always seems to be in all of us. Cherish the things you love so dearly and always remember to pay homage to what you have and respect yourself. You can do anything you wanna do in this little life of ours but everything you do will always have a big impact.
craig thomson	Johny we know where you are , because of the gift Jesus Christ offers us all by his precious blood. Amen !
Pazuzu256	"I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real-
So true.."
Keith White	This is one of his best songs. Love its power.

AudioDeficit Presents Team Pangaea	No matter how many times i watch this, the emotion just past the half way mark....gets me everytime

James Douglas	Could you imagine Johnny singing i want t I F U like an animal? Sweet . June tii?
Abbas Ali	The most hard hitting, farewell song I've ever heard. Johnny knew he didnt have long to live :( reminiscing on his past life. I think we all irrespective of gender nationality would experience the same when our day to depart draws closer. RIP Johnny you will be missed

Tyler Bruffett	Put his whole Johnny Cashussy into this song
Arizona Beaver	This man was saying how he would find a way without selling his soul if he could do it all again.
Chris Tian	"Amazing how the lyrics, the artist singing them, the video - strike such chords as our collective YT comments duly express... What is it in us, which binds us to this connection? Is it in all of us?
Whether it is the recognition of pain and suffering we experience or what we recognize we influenced to others... Certain people on the news these last weeks could do with recognizing these things and especially realizing that a lot of us... are bound by the same."
Jeremy Pickich	how can this no give you chills
Emerson Lakon	"This song truly means much to many. Whether it’s remembering Johnny Cash, or loved ones that have died. This is more than a song, it’s a requiem for all we’ve lost.

R.I.P. Johnny Cash, victims of Ukraine, and loved ones lost."
Aaron Graham	Moving. being 49 this hits hard.. would not have meant anything to me 30 years ago. Life has a way of educating you.
Jeremy Wombacher	This man crossed all lines of music, and still remains to be be timeless. R.I.P Mr. Cash

Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt

🤠Ella🤠	“I will let you down, I will make you hurt” hits so hard. My uncle used to listen to this everyday but on Christmas Eve of 2010 my mom watched a movie and this played at the end but then I woke up screaming and when my mom carried me to the Christmas tree, she remembered that that was the last place she had seen her brother. A few minutes later we got the call that he had died.
Samurai 215	"When I listen to this, I can't help but wonder how much better of a man I could be but fail to become. I have a wife and two kids and I fail them daily despite doing so much to do right by them. They deserve much better than what I have to offer, but we all love each other. Cherish every moment you have with those who matter.

We all either die alone or missed."

Caolán O'Chearnaigh	"I came here to grieve the deaths of the legends we lost over the years.
The 3 Lee's. (Stan, Christopher, and Brandon.)
Kentaro Muira,
Kurt Cobain,
Amy Winehouse,
David Bowie,
Johnny Cash himself,
And many more.
However, I did NOT come here to listen to people running their mouths off and preaching about their so-called ""God"". Wherever I go, these preachy scum are always in the comments of good music such as this.
Give me a break... Just this once.
And don't talk down to me like you know better. You wouldn't be chastising me if you knew of the horrible things I've been through at the hands of the monster known as religion...
It's broken me, time and time again. And these putrid insects still follow like sheep, blinded by delusions of grandeur. Can you not see what goes on behind closed doors?! RELIGION IS KILLING US!!!

Do not take the above rant as a personal insult. I needed it. My dearest condolences and respect go out to those who have lost loved ones and have come here to grieve. After all, that's why I'm here. I need support right now, my life is... not the best."
Jürgen Himmelstoss	Extrem berührend.

brian kraft	I want to grow up like him ,a drunk and drug addict who beats his wife, great
Someone?	Johnny Cash’s version is amazing. Trent’s version is also very powerful as it seems to be true regret in an album about someone’s complete self destruction. I didn’t even know NIN was a band until my brother told me Hurt wasn’t Cash’s and since then it is one my favorite bands.
Bill Rusteika	Who have I become tore a whole in my heart
alex drown	Beautiful I hope I meet you in heaven
:Piotr :z :Bełchatowa	"Ya know what is funny? All bands in 1980's were singing with deep words, but were not heard. Muricans were impressed with such words when Murica was singing ""yey baby"", ""yey honey"" :D"
John paul Oconnor	Hauntingly beautiful. Sad and majestic.
Jacob Laya	This song is hard to listen to Johnny being sad, still a great song but just really sad
Sylvester Lacour	Man In Black, Pure County, The Johnny Cash Show, great memories from the greatest Country songwriter ever💯💯💯❤️
RushBlood op	It's been 4 years , I found out this song when I was in 11th, and i definitely changed a lot but sometimes it hurts me a lot idk why but there is empty void in me that never gets filled. I know I am overthinker and i can't change that but what I can do now is cherish the people who i have around myself and this masterpiece keeps reminding how bad my once life was but it gets better everyday . Will keep you guys upto date

Chris Ephraums	"Every time i watch this video, it shakes me to my core.. Trent wrote this in dispair, but the saying goes. Johnny was meant to sing it. It adds so much, to know this was their last time in camera... I cry everytime i watch this. Hands down, my vote for best video...
Ever"
Sugar Gold	"I prefer Johnny’s version because it really means more from him at his age right before he passed. 
RIP, Mr. Cash."

That’s really heavy…."
Julia Sewill Farmer	My ex who was an alcoholic when I met him 4 bottles of whisky a day. I heard this song Hurt. I told him to listen to this song. He did and was at my door in tears I hugged him. He later committed suicide he was forty eight at the time of his death
Careless brownie	This song makes me think of life in the old age

Ambia Creations	The video shows a demon move in the left side  window at 41 seconds
RECYCLED HOOLIGAN🛵💣	Trying to put to rest the demons.you’ve acquired throughout your life from a young man’s perspective in the original NIN version to realizing you still face those same demons as an old man in the Johnny Cash version
The Mad Carver	It's impossible to watch this without bursting into tears
Elizabeth	You can have it all, my empire of dirt, won't mean a thing in heaven
jeremie johnson	i never got to meet  him while he was still alive :(
Matthew Birch	God, this is absolutely a masterclass in building tension in music. Everytime I come back to this song, I'm dumbfounded by the production and talent.
Kayid	me after playing Destiny
Patryk Rzepka	Family man
Carlos Meikel	I lost my son a little over a year ago... and while he was only 19, this song reminds me of him so much.  He'd come to me and my wife from a broken home and a foster care system that saw him bounce from place to place.  He had seen and experienced a lot before coming to my home.  He brought so many demons with him, and they troubled him the rest of his life, but I knew who he was underneath all the hurt and pain.  I knew the amazing potential he had... and it was absolutely beautiful seeing it shine when he let it out.  Despite all the hardships he brought with him... there was never any doubt that I would adopt this boy and make him my son.  Our times were laced with both the good and the bad, but I wouldn't trade them for anything.  His demons eventually took him away from me and left a never healing hole in my heart and soul.  He may not have had my blood running through his veins, but he carried my name, and his beautiful soul will forever be intertwined with mine.  Justin Leonard Meikel is my son... Daddio loves and misses you ever day mi hito...
Renata	Mr chaw 😎🤠🥰

Nick Castaneda	I just watched Walk The Line for the first time and this song just hits different
Kal El	Damn , the feeling, this song really suits him, at the end he became wiser and realized that all that matters is how you are as a human being, i know Trent wrote the song, but damn Johnny, you took It to another level . This will transcend for eternity.
Nunoyz Recording Studio	Excellent!
llxCreature	This song is littt!!
kiintro	Whenever this song would ever come on TV it would never fail to pull tears Smallville, Eddie Guerrero etc.
Oscar	Emotional
Glade Goodrich	Young people do not understand this song. At 76 it's clear as day!
Parris Gjerde	On the one hand, this song shows the futility of fame, empires, arrogance…. of life. The current war in Ukraine, what’s the fucking point when measured against the vastness of time, the expansiveness of our universe? Our short lives don’t even register. On the other hand, this song shows that the only thing that has a chance at immortality are our ideas, our creativity. And even those will eventually fade. We’re all here because this song lives beyond Johnny Cash and affects us. What a privilege it must be to impress future generations after you’re gone. Most of us will never realize a body of work like Johnny Cash’s. And to end it with a song like this is amazing. Thank you Nine Inch Nails. Thank you Johnny Cash. Thank you Rick Rubin.

Cyb3rRain	This song hit me really hard ever since I heard it, and through time it helped me to learn to appreciate what I have and the people that love me. I don’t want to die old with regrets of not living my life the way I want to. I want to be happy and when it’s my time to leave this world, I want to leave knowing that I did my damn best with every choice that I made.

Tom Landolt	after almost 20 years, coming back here and listening to this song for days... after such a long time understanding fully what he was singing about. probably one of my favourite songs ever. mind blowing. will keep this forever in my heart.
Edward Ellis	I heard such hype for this song. It was kind of disappointing. Just meh... Its ok I guess, but I don't hear what's so special about this song. He sounds bored.  Some record industry guy came to him with a nine inch nails song and made him cover it.
Robin Fuentes	We will always celebrate his legacy Johnny Cash 💰

lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Emergency there are genocides happening like during WW2.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!* 1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  *Hitler was a Catholic and never excommunicated.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings like against the Jews, gays, war objecters(war objecters coming soon as they are starting WW3), and other perceived undesirables as in Nazi Germany.*  People were rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the smell taken out (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  *Most of those rounded up were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.*  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast when he was asking what the concentration camps they were building were for, then later they circulated that he had been fired a year before the event, now said to be the location of the most covid(corona) cases. Corrupt. 
*Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
 According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Cardinals),* and *purple(Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  *The (cross or X) is on the shields of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs.  Through time nations and peoples have not been able to sell their goods to other nations with out this mark.  According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse **13:18** says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).  It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.*  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  *Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).* 
 Latin letters have a number associated with it, just like Hebrew and Greek.   *Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working together in self interest, not in the interest of the people.*  The earth belongs to the people collectively.  *1John**5:19* is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.(Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!* God for warned about these things happening. *Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China saying that they are the ones committing genocide.*  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA   *The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!*  Some Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 nations have had war every year, in fact there has probably never been a year or probably a month where they were not in a war. 
 *Government mandates vaccine for businesses over 100 people, and then Revelation 18 Church people, sabotage, boycott and quit, thus destroying the business, and your suppressors take full control again, enslaving you.*  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  *Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica, show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).*   Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies. Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.   Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy business.  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, just before this pandemic. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.* (corrupt) There were rioting and protests all across Europe just before the pandemic.  *Italy, the seat of Rome was the first place to long term lock down, fill their Churches with dead bodies and the first to enforce the covid vaccine pass. The Pope had a meeting with mayors and governors from around the world under the guise of environmentalism pre-covid.* 
 Read Exodus20, Deuteronomy5 and Acts15 and see about the Bible's view of idols, and you will see that it is Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 has caused people to break God's law by using the beast's money.  Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John5:19 OWO.*  People calling it the NWO, should think, isn't this the same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918?  *Think! Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  ****There is two realities playing out.***  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control!* Reality 1 is for public consumption, where as reality 2 is Church and State. Think of which reality is really being talked about!  *UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison.* Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world through force until the birth of the US and the French revolution, which ended the Bible's prophecy of 1260 years of domination by Rome.  *Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other side had an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads stacked up.  Ste Bartholomew's eve massacre.* In the Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and governments to kill steal and enslave.  *Urgent necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public!*  Through history the Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and the leader of the exterminations was Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler.  *Most exterminations of WW2 were in Catholic Poland.*  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  *Omicron is a Greek letter like the last letter omega which has the O sound.  In the the original Hebrew of the Bible there are two words את untranslated in *all* other languages in Genesis1:1and other places.  In Revelation it tells you who the את is.  It has been hidden in the Greek to deceive you, as the complete Bible was in Hebrew and the Alpha and Omega(first and the last) of Revelation is really the את of Genesis1:1 א(aleph) is the first letter of Hebrew and ת(tau) is the last, and the one represented as את was in the beginning with God.  Omicron is a code word for omega.  Omicron is information exposing the את being changed to Alpha and Omega.*  The false Church wars to protect its false doctrines. *Determining the future by movies, is pure stupidity.  ××Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being gassed!xx*  Alex Jones is quoting German and Italian sources...the perpetrators of previous genocide (Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)  Global corporate tax is really a war on Daniel12:4. Tax the Royals!  **How could there be a vaccine for a new variant with out testing, that is not covered by previous jabs?**  G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers. *Who will do the will of God? (Revelation 18:6)*   I've been warning for over two years that Rome/UK would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.  Biden stopped the natural gas pipeline in the US and now in Europe.  This is Rome's war.  Will Rome attack Taiwan also, and blame China?  Tell others to read this! !(((?"

To see if I still feel

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Greg Akinson	OMG! I have always been a big fan of classic country and grew up with it but whoever thought that this MESS was a good idea should have there head examined! What a way to disgrace the man in black while he is dying and has little mind left of his own.... This is shameful and in no way an honor to the man and his legacy. Those who think differently are obviously incapable of actual thought.....
Sheri Read	My favorite song of his...He died 'with his boots on'...He saved his best songs for last. This CD went platinum. I love that. The dedication of a life time...Thank you for the memories Johnny Cash. We love you.💝

Max Kronader	When Johnny Cash covers your song, it becomes Johnny Cash's song.
Owen Lewis	There is a deep beauty in this song. When we lose our lives, we truly find them. All the empires we could build fall to ground in the end, but Jesus took the penalty for our sins. We die with Him, and we will be raised with him
Appalachian Wanderer	Yesterday, I was 24 and full of potential. Today, I'm 51 and I'm becoming an old man. So, so many regrets. I want to go back, I want to find a way to keep myself. Johnny, I feel your hurt.
Mike Jobst (Bulldog)	R.I.P.  best Cover ever.
no one	Still, years later, since I heard this first time, I cry. The inevitable end is drawing closer and the burden of regretful memories grows larger.
Josh Bieler	Leonine shower of comets in sky… when seen through a child’s light eyes with the heaviest of eyelids…  here you  could have it all: this empire of dirt, as Love is simply creation’s song… so told generation to generation by peoples such as the Hmong… Cinderella with her magical pumpkin… Jesus with your and mine sin… Frankenstein was right… the hardest thing to give is sight… so sleep as you eat, sleep as you make love… just prepare to wake at the cooing of the dove…

Oak Tree	Most of us are bodies with a soul on the inside. Johnny Cash was a soul walking around with a body on the outside.

且无	"The first time I listened to ""hurt"" was when I was in  senior three (18 years old) . I cried when I listened to it. It was the first time I cried because I listened to a song. To this day, I still cry whenever I hear this song. I don't know why, but I really want to see Cash and hug him."

Sam Dubb	This man... this song... his woman.. his empire.. ugh. There are so many things I want to say, but can’t quite find the right words. This man was, and always will be an absolute legend and it’s because of his completely bad ass moments like this!! Seriously. Him recording this song, THIS SPECIFIC SONG, at this time in his life, as a goodbye to his fans... I mean... it was like he was saying “did I not entertain you? If I could change it all for June’s sake, I would.. but have what’s left of me, you vultures” Or am I completely wrong? Because yes, ‘the people’ helped him to become who he is/was and they may have been a big part of why he had as much as he did,  but it was also like they gave it all to him just so they could see him burn it all to the ground because that was entertaining to them just as much as his music.. he was so scrutinized by so many, for so long it’s like the saying “if you give them enough rope, they’ll hang themselves” and we all love a great tragedy.. I know there are so many ways to interpret art, especially art that is this beautifully done.. and I gathered so many things from this, but I could feel it in his voice, the way he sang this, the video clips, the way June looked at him.. I mean... UGH! This is the best thing that I have ever seen and I have rewatched this MANY times since he released it, and don’t get me wrong, N.I.N did this song right, but Johnny Fucking Cash..!!? Wow.
Dimitrios F	The older I get the more I like his music.
Craftbeer Lover	My Pop was a huge fan of Johnny, the first time I played this song for him, I ended up playing many times over so my Dad could listen and learn the lyrics. I played NIN version, he wasn't impressed.
BlitzzBob	I cry alnost every time i hear this song. It reminds me of my father and grandfather. I recently re watched several documentaries about Johnny and how he died this song is even sadder to me now.
THEJR1948	I believe this is from the American tapes.  Johnny Cash and Punk producer Rick Rubin were a match made to be together.
Ivor Thomas	Putin can't hurt us if we stop hurting ourselves and fight

Omar Garcia	Sounds like early he sold his soul and now deeply regrets it seeing all of the fame and money simply dirt to him now , saying he would have found away if he could do it over , be with christ everyone don't lose sight of what really important in this life . Listen don't just hear .

Xenomorph	When this man dies he will burn in hell because he sold his soul to the demons underneath... It may seem sad, but in reality he actually deserves it for forsakening his humanity for the pleasure of living...

Nelson Reyes	The easiest voice to imitate is Johnny Cash voice
Mad Dog	The inclusion of Jay-Z and him flashing his stupid hand-sign totally scars this video. Practically any other musician or celebrity, or even a homeless person of the street, would have been an infinite improvement. Better still, they could've just never invited him to appear in the first place.

Melania Monica Craciun	Still the best teacher of freedom of expression fans, the best Maestro for young generations how to make of a such iconic track one of their own, never feel sorry to entertain audience this good, how many rivers of tears made me weep this track because Johnny Cash was playing it, some tracks are so wonderfully comunist, after the awesome Olympic games in Beijing anyone can love this heavenly delight fans, never let political crap ruin average citizens lives, the nation is something very different, sounds just this good
Jorge Garcia	This song will always remind me of us getting covid in my home i was very sick sitting in the warm sun even my little pet dog would climb on me because she knew we wasnt right fever achy bones and only God knew if we come out of it ,thank God we all did
Jordan Dickson	Most relatable song of all time because one day we will all go through this but the only thing that matters if we are happy and content when this moment comes this is a message to live your life to the fullest and appreciate your loved ones before it’s to late because that’s all that matters because your legacy lives on through those that love you!!!

Josh South	Sad, during this video his health was not as good. But he still did it that shows he did care about his songs and put his soul into it. If y'all don't know about Johnny's life I would recommend watching the movie about him it was one of the most wonderful things I've saw (and it gives context to this video). Love you Johnny.

Joey ElevenBravo	You will be in our hearts forever Johnny.I hope you found peace from all the pain you were in.
Phellipe Gonçalves	We don't know what passes in a person's heart but I believe that Carter's death  makes Cash feel so lost on this world. Wanna believe that exists after life reality and hope both meet again on that.

pimplyface64	"Addiction is hell... we all have some but some of us a crippled by it. It have lost control but you seem normal on the surface. 

Who ever you are or what ever you're going through just remember we al need someone to talk to and a professional is your best friend, speak to a therapist. And remember they aren't all good at thier jobs so don't loose hope and keep searching for a good one."
ManofMercy	"From first hearing of this track from Prototype 2 marketing, then years later finding the original NIN track (from a Rick & Morty episode of all things), to not long after finding this version again on a Cyberpunk 2077 tribute video last year.

Cash will never truly be forgotten. This really was his swan song & he made it a masterpiece."

Micah Goingback	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt

Micah Goingback	Rick Rubin... thank you for making this album happen!!! And all the other albums you had the freedom of letting artist be an artist!!! A living legend you are!!!!
hopeapallo	One of the best cover songs I have ever heard!  The video is great too!
Simple Chronology	This is still a mind-blowing farewell, 20 years later.  Cash could sing the phonebook and make it sound good, but the unlikely choice of Reznor's song was tailor-made for him, despite sounding nothing like anything he had done before.  So he went out on an emotional and creative high point at a ripe old age.  How many people can claim that?
George Hunter	Cash for all his faults knew his Saviour hence all the visual pointers to Him. He (Johnny) has more than an empire of dirt now.
JaKe SwOrD	this song means so much to me. I cant even describe it. I have been through hell in my life, and this song just hits so close to home. I cant tell anyone about my life. so music is my release.

Daniel Eizaga	This Song is good.

Michael colyer	This song is amazing journey about the pain of addiction and failure,  but Cash makes it about life in general, because we are addicted to life! Our memories are painfully good when you look at them through the lens of time. Especially when you know that your days are numbered.  No more hugs goodnight and kisses good morning. Just a Empire of dirt to blow away like the sands of time.
Marc Ohare	I don't think I ever heard a song mention the fatality of passing time so well, seeing June Carter here makes me want to cry for knowing how soon they'll both be called home.

Billy White	Sad to see Johnny toward the end. His face had changed so much. He looked so old and sick. He sang the song with all his heart. Easy to tell that even his voice was barely recognizable. So sad to see a great legend as his health failed him
Thomas Howlin	This was so, so, so special
Just me	so much emotion radiating from this song.
Sean Nash	"Sadly he was disrespected in his twilight. Treated as a side show to be ignored as if only background sound.
How many know, how much talent he has taken to the screen to be recognized as something we need? When we wanted it but did not yet know.
He was and is more than that."

Steffen AM	I remember how I saw that video in the early 2000s in TV. Recently I just read a good graphic novel about Johnny Cash by Reinhard Kleist. Johnny was a great artist and touching, not only for Americans. So universal human. I believe he´s in heaven looking down on us now.
Terr Genn	A very sensual song, although, of course, I will not be able to fully understand it, but I feel one hundred percent of the emotions that the author conveys, thinking about the fact that one day I, my friends and relatives will not be there, at the same time it becomes sad and so vital that it cannot be conveyed in words.
Just a white guy	I like when he did that audio book of the cremation of sam mcgee

Stephen Duggan	So many people say masterpiece in this crazy world . But this is a masterpiece. Trent did a good version
Blazin Puffs	I'll never forget the day I heard this. It was on VHS when they still played music videos. I shut the TV off to think about what I just watched and just started bawling my eyes out. At the time I was 7 so my problems seemed miniscule compared to some shit people were going through but for whatever reason I felt all the burdens off my shoulders lift that day. Best cry I've ever had.

Nick Yates	I was so happy that I got to meet him 2000 when I was 6
Julie Hill	What a remarkable song, is it the lyrics or the video that draws you in? “I wear this crown of thorns” …. absolutely fantastic to resonate with Jesus Christ … some poet 🥰
charlotte white	Boooo
Amy Waterman-McIntyre	"Johnny Cash mutilated this song, the meaning, and even the recognition for writing it mostly went to him, too. 

These words, written originally by Trent Reznor found a way to describe a perspective of an addict finding acceptance.  Because goddammit  acceptance is always the fucking answer. And It's  painful for everyone. No one feels how goddamn defeating more than the addict. Idk what the fuck I'm even saying lol. And  Hopefully most of you will never relate to what I am saying. 

 just hate my comment and argue that ""Johnny Cash sang it better."""
Dakota Owings	What a legend you will be missed this song makes me think of my dad who passed away and I think about life everyday and this song just expresses how I feel

Pepeold	Thanks to the legendary Rick Rubin for reviving this legend to give us  legendary songs
Gordon Ross	It's hard to put into words just how wonderfully moving this song is. The lyrics (yes, I know he didn't write them), the scenes from his life, walking with his kids, images flashing by like a train, long-lost memories, broken records on the floor of the Johnny Cash museum, collecting dust, his wife looking down on him, an Empire of  Dirt, broken thoughts you can't repair, all you are left with is hurt and the deafening silence after closing the piano for the last time. A truly astonishing masterpiece.
Chris Maw	Where is this filmed

Dasani 	I STUBBED MY TOE LAST NIGHT
forest_hobo	If Nine Inch Nails themself says that this is Johnny Cash's song, that alone tells you how good version this is and how much they respect good 'ol Johnny!
Dan Fernandes	A man who did some truly awful things in his life and sold his soul, trying desperately to repent. When people do the research it’s no wonder why so many artists die tragically or are suicided. The ones that grow old really have it the worst because their impending death and mortality cannot be ignored. I’m waiting for Dylan to talk about why he sold his soul and how repentance might save him. Or not. Funny how so many heroes are nothing more than satanic pedophile sellouts.
Kevin	That is so powerful I can't imagine anybody trying to cover that song . That's Johnnys' !

Mr big	That what have I become line makes me feel like a bad person compared to who I used to be, maybe it was for the better or it might be for the worst I do all I know is most of us would not recognize our younger and older selves
Rachel Lovelace	He made this NIN song what it never would have been without him singing it. The original doesn't compare. You are missed Johnny.
Aaron Smalling	Arguably one of the best cover songs ever. Undeniably the best music video ever produced.
Big Nasty	Dear God. The pain of being wrong. People mourn being hurt. The pain of hurting one you love tears your soul apart, and deservedly so. I know his pain, and mourn for him and the one he hurt. I come here to torture myself occasionally, for otherwise I remain miserably numb.

Being the beloved ""kid"" of such a group of wonderful people backfires in the end, when you're the sole survivor. That is where John Cash was when he conceived this version of Hurt."

Edward Hinton	It's all gone mate
Low T PC	Beautifully dark and emotional song and take on the NIN song. I love it and come back to it pretty often. But why are the levels pushed so high at the end of the song to where the audio clips like crazy? Who the hell mastered this song?
vids eo	Johnny showed his depth and character with this song I hope you are enjoying the other side meet you there one day,🖖
REUNITE AMERICA	That’s an easy one for me. The only thing that ever screwed up my mind and threw me off track was prescription drugs! If not for that poison. That alcohol in pill form, I’d of never lost my way!
Christopher Harrison	What you was up in New York got in trouble went to the penitentiary up there they came in with cigarettes and started burning you while but rapping you and it hurt I'm trying to understand but maybe when they messed your face up knocked some marbles lose I can't read beating around the bush only straight through !?
Randall Nilsen	It’s a hard moment when we realize that the people around us would be better off with positive memories of us, then living with the drowning self destructive ways some artists, addicts, or just hurt/depressed versions of ourselves we have become. Sometimes there isn’t a way out in our eyes and we except that. It’s Just unfortunately not fair to those who love us… they just have to remember it’s not there loves being lived that way every day hour by hour. It’s not as simple as just being grateful for what we have, or smiling cause people love us… that’s what this song is truly saying. Some of us are hurt and in turn unintentionally hurting others by hurting ourselves. Holy shit that just hit me like a ton of bricks as I typed it 🤯😞. Being true to one’s self comes at a cost of being viewed as selfish or self absorbed. It’s not the case though and people need to wake up and put themselves in the others shoes for a day. Thanks for reading this, I’ll see y’all in the next life 👍🏻.

Requiem of a Golden Experience	"When I heard this at 14 I thought it was shit compared to the oringal, But now that I listen to it years late I must say this and the oringal cant be compared there so diffrent and good in their own way. But hearing ""If I could start again a million miles away"" really hurt because all I could imagine was seeing the end of your life in front of you and wanting to start over. I think all humans fear death and I know I do."

Michaela Burks	"Ive asked many times if NIN or JC did this song better. Literally every sinle person I've asled says JC was better due to his circumstances at the time and the acoustic tune to it..

Only thing thats bothers me is he changed ""Crown of shit"" to ""crown of thorns"" which imo actually sounds a lot better, but still i wish he wouldn't have changed up the original words.
Still the Johnny cash version will always be superior!!"

JP	As I am approaching 60 this year, this song really hits home. Especially Johnny Cash performing it.  As we get older, we reflect on our failures, accomplishments, our loves, and our heartbreaks. Time comes much too quickly, and before you know it, it’s gone. This song brings up all those feelings.
Brandon H.	This pierces the soul. If you're listening to this, know that you are not alone. RIP Johnny

Edie	"I love this song so much, you can literally feel the emotion as he sings and I still can't listen to it without crying... (doesn't stop me listening to it though!)
Trent from Nine Inch Nails actually wrote it and when he heard Johnny Cash's version of this song  he said, quite accurately, that ""Johnny Cash owned it"" and must say I agree with him!!"
T Wriggy	Just shows what Johnny Cash was capable of, even to the grave. This song really means a lot in this day and age, it talks about corruption which is what the world has come to. Men aren’t men anymore and only the old still roam. It talks about how this corruption can affect yourself and others and that this life is not one they want. A true masterpiece and a view on what the world is slowly becoming without anyone realising. This is more than just a song, it’s a message.
Prebo Dimeji Akano	whose here from skillshare?
Misha	:(
Bélaa	Its heartbreaking, still today
San Antonio Strong	The world misses you Johnny Cash. RIP Sir.
Steven Purdie	Just as Johnny Cash did, I also have Diabetes. So, I totally understand this song. Everyone I know has gone away in the end. When my time comes, I am not EVEN going to have a funeral service because my family all turned their backs on me and will probably come to my funeral to weep over me and say how much they loved me when they couldn't even do that while I was alive. Bunch of hypocritical sons of bitches. I will most likely be cremated, put into an urn and placed next to my wife in her grave and that will be that.

Lucas Cruz	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

The Brokenhearted Cowboy	Man that's scary. He was 70 when this clip was shot, and he looks like an 80/83yo, and he was one of the coolest men ever lived on Earth 10 years before.
/u/ spockdad	"Nine inch Nails original version was awesome, it’s sad in its own way and great in its own way.  
But Trent is right, this is now Johnny’s song.  This version makes you want to ball your eyes out.   You will be missed."
Sania Singh	Respect mr johnny cash.
peteK	He's been there, the pain will make it go away....my little brother suffered the needle, he never recovered. May he RIP.

Rodrigo Lopes	Me parece uma canção triste ..gostaria de compreender o inglês .
Reid Steph	Don't really know anymore. Constantly falling into my pain and past and nothing makes it's go away. No drugs, no alcohol... Nothing. Constantly repeating the same mistakes because you have a mental disability making you different from everyone else.
Nick Don	Jonny Cash has always been one of my favorite artists and people throughout the years! ❤️🙏 🎤           You will always be with us through your music/lyrics.

Laceduplolita	If I was Trent Reznor, and I heard this version for this first time...I would cry so hard I'd never be able to sing this the same way again.
The AngrySand	This song brings me to tears every time.
TacoBell5DollarBox	this song will bring tears to yours eyes.  Its tough, but you gotta live life the best you think you can.
Country  Music	Listened to it the first time today, just amazed by the amount of emotions being transported
Outlaw 80	""" Empire of dirt "" symbolises his material things and money that truly mean nothing in the end. People you Love that Love you back is what makes a person rich."
nukes	I went to the Johnny cash museum in Tennessee and when they started playing this song it hurt
WishedIowa3	My grandparents died. I was 20 years old. Then my parents when I was 40-45. My father died a week ago of old age. Here is the thing. I know it’s tough, but I/we have children to take care of. It is a natural cycle. I watched my grandparents/parents die, and so too will my children watch me die just as they have already seen their grandparents go. We must go on. Though it may seem like we’ve lost everything, we are everything to our younger family members. And the cycle continues on and on until the world dies. It is the natural order of things. That does not make it less sad, but it is reality. We are here for a reason, it is to learn, to teach, to do good. I will always miss my grandparents and parents, but right now where I’m at in my life, they have gone through this in their lifetime. It all depends on what you believe in. I believe I will see them again, and my children will see me again when I am gone. Though their physical body is dead, I believe what makes them them, is still here. We all go through this at some point. We can’t give up, we have so many people depending on us to be mentors and do the right thing.

pablo moya	💚💙💜
Rick Stephenson	It was the best way for Johnny to share his feelings and thoughts. You can just imagine what the person was thinking when he wrote the song. Hurt — Trent Reznor's 'valentine to the sufferer' was deepened. Nine Inch Nails. Listen to their version.
physiodude2	Trent Reznor is a genius.
McYeeetuss	When I die, play this as they put me in the ground.
Fani	If l could start again l wouldn't change a thing
Garrold	okay, I get that this song is like Bowie's lazarus / blackstar, but doesn't the meaning / magic completely go away in a cover? Like, holy shit this has 400 million more listeners than the original song. Don't get me wrong, I like Johnny Cash but this is not okay dude.
Richard Fasano	The only song that makes me cry uncontrollably. We all knew what he meant. 😞
Bob Outdoors	Leaving this comment so that whenever someone likes it I'll comeback and listen to this masterpiece

Xyloh	"Man, this song hits so different. it reminds me of multiple things
 first my ex, she was the most beautiful women in my teen years, yet I treated her like a piece of shit. That was 5 years ago now but if I could go back in time I would treat her with the upmost respect. 

The second thing is friends, the people I've hurt and talked shit about I regret most of it now (as some people deserved it) at the age of 20 going 21 this year it hurts to listen to this knowing that I have no mates no Xbox friends no IRL mates , no relationships (trust me I try, or tried) I only have 3 mates on Snapchat and no Instagram or Twitter or Facebook. Shit Hurts mate , like a part of me wants mates and a relationship but I feel like I can't make friends anymore like no one values me. So now I'm just like fuck all you guys .I just stay in my room all day listening.  to music like this."

Matt Cook	Oh god this one hurts it's like losing family
Vincent Marucut 2	Why do I think the you stay the hell away from me line kinda ruined it for me?
CobraLion 👑🎗	This song...its tough to hear because of how much emotion is there...this song...has a meaning...a sign that you are ready...to face your own mortality. This song represents that legends like Johnny never die...they are simply reborn. Rest in Peace, Johnny Cash...you are one of my favorite country singers.
Heidi Lacey	♥️~
sut	One of those songs that rips you up inside and makes you cry
David Stanford	I watch and watch this video. Johnny believed he would die before everyone he knew. He outlived them. Johnny sat before Christ and simply asked for forgiveness and a new life. I believe he received new life in Jesus Christ.
rbx3	The great reminds us why he was great!
Paulholio	I keep coming back to this video about once a year
Un_Involved	I only found this song because of the movie Logan but the emotions that he conveys are so penetrating.  I hope I never really understand him.
Spencer Catlett	I maybe a 2002 kid, but when you grow up with parents from 80s 90s, its hard to escape all the rock, legends, inspirational artist. I can't say I know how people feel, but our generation knows what its like for a legend to pass, even if its not a musical artist, could be a tv character anything, were all connected in some way. I didn't come for hate, I came to tell you yes young people listen to these kind of music still and it will still live on I promise you.

Moisés Santos	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

clark johnston	🤔I think it's ironic a dying man brought new life into a dying song.
Candice Johntry	“ I would keep myself … I would find a way “ he’s explaining how he sold his soul to the devil and he regrets it … he is a legend … sometimes that comes w an unfortunate price

Mtheuz	02/02/2022 estou aqui para dizer que esta música marcou a minha adolescência... assim como a voz que perdemos hj ... Quando escuto essa música me lembro do Logan, e quando soube que a voz do logan se foi hj o meu dia se escureceu... acredito que nunca mais verei os filmes do Wolverine com a mesma emoção... pois no fundo eu irei saber que esta faltando algo ... eterno Isaac nos deixou hoje mas o seu legado ficará pra sempre na minha vida como de muitos que assistiram logan e todos os outros filmes do Wolverine...

John Cannon	My dad was a huge Johnny fan and I grew up on songs like Ghost Riders in the Sky and Ring of Fire. And I loved NIN back in college. This song, even though not written by Mr. Cash, epitomizes his life and career and is the most amazing capstone one could ask for. I still can't help but think of my dad when I hear Johnny Cash, and it makes me smile, even when a song like this brings back the pain of losing my father to cancer. Kudos to you, Mr. Cash - the very definition of cool.
Mr Digit	Float Down The River , Don't Get Hung Up On The Sand Bars./;-))Peace.

Ghost A	мир праху
Patrick Frerking	"For those that don't know. This is actually a nine inch nails song.  Written by the lead singer Trent Reznor himself. At first he told Johny that he couldn't have his song. The song he holds closest to his heart. His greatest achievement, in his own opinion. Johny made the song anyways and sent it to Trent.... Trent cried because Johny made the song so great. And then he wasn't mad at Johny for covering it anymore. And at one point Trent said ""that is Johnnie's song now."""
OPINIONATED	The fact that the original composer and entertainer of this song respectfully transferred ownership to Johnny speaks for itself.
sasha	This is one of my favorite songs of all time
Rose G	A man a legend who had many faults like any of us but always fought his way back to God and sobriety. It goes to show us no matter how many empires we think we build it all becomes dust or dirt in the end because you can’t take it with you as you stand before God. Truly a God fearing man in so many ways. May God bless you Johnny Cash 🙏🏼♥️🕊
Blackened Heart	This is hands down one of the best songs ever recorded I know it was originally a Nine inch nail song but even Trent rezner himself was blown away by this! Johnny Cash was absolutely amazing! He's the only country artist that I can think of which is loved by people from every type of music you can think of Pop rap rock metal so many people respect Johnny Cash!

Геннадий Орлов	серьёзные люди им заинтрисовались
Christoph Seifert	This is my favourite rendition by Johnny Cash. It gives the song a whole new meaning and turns frustrations of a young man into the frustrations and regret of an old man. Like a young man's rage turned into rage against the dying of the light.

Tater The Gamer	This is one of the saddest songs I’ve  heared
Jessica Rasse	Y’all, I know MTV pop up videos is long gone! But there are websites for behind songs, stop being petty and read what was behind the lyrics to him! I can’t tell you how many times I have listened to songs with my personal thoughts on why I like a song. Only to read about the song and it was NOTHING like the artist even wrote the song about! Are we adults here 🧐🥴? And please go ahead and pick out all my flaws on my picture or my wording…let me hear your dirty laundry 🧺, lol 😂 I might even fold it for ya!

Cinereo	The Cash version has real depth and character, while the Trent version sounds like something an angsty 9th grader would come up with.
Joshua ĐJ	"'I've heard this song like million times, while I'm sad. Suddenly this one time, i was listening and heard how much he's grieving about himself and his life. And the PAIN in his voice. It really is ""HURT""'."

Jimmy Armijo	"This is really one haunting song. Back in the 60s-70s my dad was in the USN. And Cash was one of his favorites. I remember Live at Folson Prison and Live at San Quentin Prison. And another album he had, a caricature drawing of Cash. Then in the 80s, he was much into Miranchi music. Then several years before he died he listened to classic country. Miss you Pop.
PS June Carter Cash was a pretty lady even in her old age."
Tapatio Man	Thank you
Scott Johnston	"I decided to make a cover version of Johnny's version.

I spent months working on all the orchestration, and the complicated background music. As of now I have 28 tracks. The music is done. It's the best I can do without a professional studio to recording. And it's fucking great. But it lacks one thing.


I cannot capture Johnny's voice, Johnny's passion."
Jonathan Pollard	Love
Unknown Alias UK	still singing Cash in 2022.
Kian Kelly	this song is showing his thoughts on his life he’s depressed thinking about his death is soon and all his friends have died and they matter more than anything he’s created and earned

John 3:16	"Jesus is the Word, God the Creator, and the Son of God, John 1:1.

Jesus came to teach us His perfect ways, Micah 4:2, that He is the author of the perfect faith we must have, the faith the Father wants. We believe in obedience to Him unto salvation, Hebrews 5:9.

Salvation is not a one step, one stop process. Salvation is something that is a multi-component process. The first step is to believe in Jesus, John 3:16 as well as believe in the Gospel. Believing in Jesus to be saved is the very initial part, as well as accepting Him, John 3:16, John 17:20. But obedience must follow after that initial belief immediately followed by true repentance, Luke 13:3, Mark 1:15. Those who do not believe will be damned, John 3:36. Even the devil and demons believe in Jesus as well, James 2:19. Thus, a true believing in Jesus is something continuous, as it is written with the Greek word in John 3:16 for believing. Jesus is the Word made flesh, John 1:14. Jesus is the Word of God, John 1:1. Jesus is also the Creator of all things, John 1:3. So if one believes in the Word, that means what the Word says, one will obey. If one disobeys what the Word says, how can there be any true belief there? The belief therefore is in vain. If one truly believes in Jesus, the Word, one will live out what the Word teaches. 

The Gospel is more than Jesus dying on the cross and rising. This is only a part of the full Gospel message. The Gospel is the wisdom of God for us to learn and abide in. Jesus came to teach us this wisdom personally, Micah 4:2. There is no sin in His wisdom. So if we choose to follow Him, we choose to adopt His wisdom as well as live by it, Matthew 10:38, Matthew 16:24-25. Jesus commands His Apostles to go and teach everything He commands, Matthew 28:20. Jesus did not tell them to go and teach what Peter or any other apostle commands. He strictly has the perfect wisdom of God to the fullest, again, which is why He never sinned. 

If we continue in sin there remains no more atonement for us on the cross, Hebrews 10:26. For knowing the Bible is not enough, we must also put the Gospel into practice in order to enter the kingdom, Matthew 7:21. If we truly love God, we will keep His commandments, John 14:15. Paul reiterates that we must repent and do the works worthy of repentance Acts 26:20. This repentance is for everyone and was first preached by John the Baptist in Matthew 3:8. So both the Apostles in the New Testament and John the Baptist preaching to the people of Israel under the law still are required to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance. Jesus defines repentance as turning from sin as well as a change of mind, both, not one nor the other. Jesus says Nineveh would have repented at the preaching of Jonah. Then looking to Jonah 3:10, we see how Ninevah repented. They did not simply have a change of mind only, but they also had a change of works as it says they turned from their wicked ways. 

We believe in being saved by grace which is through faith, and that faith without works is dead faith, James 2:14-26. Jesus is the author of our faith, Hebrews 5:9, and His faith was filled with works that pleased the Father, not men, not flesh. Jesus had the perfect faith that always pleased the Father, John 8:29, Revelation 14:12. Grace, with respect unto salvation, is the opportunity to repent. Without true repentance, no grace will save anyone. Ephesians 2:8-9 by Apostle Paul says ""we are saved by grace through faith, and this is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast."" Nearly always when Paul mentions works in the New Testament he is referring to the works of the law as well as Jewish traditions not found in the 613 Mosaic laws but were considered in that culture and society as law. For instance, the priests questioned why Jesus and His followers did not wash their hands before eating. This was not in the 613 Mosaic laws but was a tradition the priests added into their culture/religion. Thus, Paul is referring to dead works or works of the flesh in Ephesians 2:8-9. Obeying Jesus is not part of the Old Testament law. Jesus gave new commands such as ""Love one another as I have loved you, this is a new command I give you."" There are many detailed teachings from Jesus we must abide by if we truly are in Him, which Paul confirms in 1 Timothy 6:3. We must abide in the teachings of Jesus as He, Paul, and the other Apostles taught. This is the will of the Father, Matthew 17:5. 

In the Old Testament they were under the law. They were dead on the spot or had to pay a pentalty for their sins on the spot. Now we are under grace. This means we have the precious opportunity to repent, but if we do not do our part and do such or overcoming our sins, we will taste the second death then, Rev 2:11. The blood of Jesus, through His death, burial, and resurrection, is what we need. Because the Son obeyed the Father perfectly, His blood was shed for the remission of sins. And because of His perfect obedience to the Father, the Father accepts the Son's request to have mercy on us. That's why Jesus is the only mediator between God and man, 1 Timothy 2:5. So now the Father wants us to obey His Son, Matthew 17:5, Hebrews 5:9. This forgiveness for our past and present sins is made available freely, for salvation is a free gift that cannot be earned Ephesians 2:8-9. This means there is nothing one must do in order to be forgiven by the Father. Christ paid the price for us in order to receive that forgiveness. But moving forward, we must maintain that by obeying our new Master, Christ, no longer sin. For we cannot serve two masters, Matthew 6:24. Christ was prophecied in the Old Testament as the ""Redeemer."" To redeem us through His precious blood, means He purchased us out of spiritual slavery that is sin and death, for the wages of sin is death, Romans 6:23. He then is our new Master whom we must abide in, no longer willful sin."
tomek leczkowski	Remarkable!
Ethan Thompson	In the end, all you have left is memories. What will you remember? That is the question this song begs, and it is why I get so emotional hearing it. Spread love and accept it, it’s all we have in this world.

Jim Beam	"He is saying not to idolize him. Because he is only a mortal and will let you down in the end. ""I will make you burn"". He is apologizing to the world for his stain upon it. He wishes he did different. All his glory and riches has returned to dirt. God bless this man in heaven. This is his repentance to the world. DMX did the same thing. But a video on YouTube not a song. Bless these men. May they rest in heaven."

Benjámin Kurilla	"They used this for the trailer of Logan.
I immidiately knew I can expect a good movie."
Jason Harris	"He was torn up about June dying recently. And he liked this Trent Reznor NiN song and did a cover. This song is about his impact on June and her life, and how he never felt good enough for her. Even after he won her over, he never felt like he deserved her. I think some of us can relate to that, for certain.
And he doesn't care about any wealth, status or anything other than getting her back, but knowing he can't."

Peter Allman	"I heard busker Ellena Mackay beautifully singing this song at The High Cross in Chester, England yesterday. I hadn't heard it before, but was instantly captured by the ""I hurt myself today..."" thinking it may be about self-harm. Some young folk passed by and one started singing along so I realised it must be a known song. When I asked Ellena what the song was, she answered, ""'Hurt', the Johnny Cash version"". 
This clip really blew me away. The whole production, top notch."

Pixei Otto	I love the two versions so much. They aim to speak about topics so different from eachothers yet they both nailed it
Hay River Safety Training	My grandfathers favorite musician. My grandfather was a lovely hardworking/hard ass greatest generation type person, struggled with alcohol to stave off the stress of owning a small business and his experiences in war and poverty growing up. He died worth millions, but a fractured man. This song captures so much about that generation. We have it so easy in so many ways, even during this horrible pandemic. Cherish  the older generations, they lived a life we can't understand as it was gone by the time we are here. It pains me that we only seem to focus on the negatives of each generation. We all have so much to give.
84sp84	I see many folks giving their take on the meaning this holds. For me it’s open for us all to let it speak for each one of us. We all have our own Hurt, unique to our journeys thru life.

Dusty Sell	I rarely comment on any songs or debates. I really like this song. Loved listening to both Jonnie Cash and NIN as a teenager. I think they both put their hearts in this song and showed that people (no matter what age or genre) can still have human experiences. It is almost a tribute in reverse since many tributes are from younger generations to older. May make this that much more special.

Now they say my hip has to be replaced. I can’t remember what it feels like to just be normal. I don’t want to be high anymore, I just want the pain to stop… all my friends are dead. I’m 40… I think I’ll be dead soon too.

James Smith	This is his last will and testament, he is asking for forgiveness before he meets his maker. He lost his world long before this, he lost his life when his beloved wife died, after that, it was just a countdown to his end.

Scott Congdon	Saddest song ever, a masterpiece
Ben Allan	"I imagine all those photographs and posters on the walls... They're like Lenin.

I swear... He wouldn't let his brother down... Nor his sister. :(

This is our song."
Charles Sutton	"The look on June's face...my god. I cry every time I watch this. 
It seemed like everyone had
forgotten they were still alive.
Then...
From what part of themselves did they find the courage to show the world how near they were to life's end? Not bidding farewell to us, but to each other? 
""What have I become, my sweetest friend?"" 
I can't get over how her love for him shone through her eyes, even in her own twilight, and how much they wanted just one more day with each other. I believe they would've given all they owned for that.
Thank you Johnny.
Thank you June."
Andy Borchert	I have to cry to this song. One of his best songs.

K Paine	Goddamn fucking legend.
J.M. Starling	After nearly 20 years, the impact is the same...jaw dropping.
ArcaneAzmadi	I first heard this song not too long after it first came out (20 years ago this year), but I never looked up this music video before now, because I didn't think I'd be able to bear it. But I finally took a deep breath and watched it, and I was right to think that it would be an ordeal because the song along is already crushingly sad, but together with the music video it's almost too much to bear. I have a serious lump in my throat as I type this, because this is one of the most heartwrenching music videos of all time.
Pablo Escobar	This song touches the soul you can feel his pain in every guitar string

Truly one of that greatest videos ever made. A song that Trent Reznor wrote juxtaposed to Johnny Cash's life."
Tom	"So I feel tonight... the night before my 60's bday....

John Drakakis	THE 1ST TIME I HEARD THIS SONG WAS WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE EDDIE GUERRERO TRIBUTE VIDEO ON THE MONDAY NIGHT RAW EPISODE BACK IN 2005 WHERE THE WWE PAID TRIBUTE TO HIM AFTER HE DIED AND EVERY TIME I HEAR THIS SONG I ALWAYS HAVE IMAGES OF EDDIE GUERRERO IN MY HEAD!!!
Joshua Dale Ridge	This version of the song hit home. Hard felt with moor heart meaning and a true love & deeper understanding of what so many people  face in this world sorry Trent I like ur version but it's just noise conperad to a master of his craft
Albert Westings	god this song always reminds me of my grandparents both my father and mothers parents were the cornerstones to each family it was tragic at each death that happened over the years, first my dads mom over a decade ago of whom i was babied by due to me being both my mom and dads first son, and just recently last year my moms dad passed away due to the current sickness running amok around the globe, god i miss them and i feel for my dad and mom and each family the pain it hurts, the memories sadden yet still makes us happy at the same time may they rest in peace and god bless they're souls.
Goblyn Kyng	I have watched this video and listened to this song dozens of times....and it breaks me every single time.  Truly beautiful.  Even Trent acknowledges that this is his song now.  Simply fantastic.
Ashley Elizabeth	Such a beautiful man, one who has faith in Christ. God is wonderful. :-)
nAz	It's hard not to tear up listening to this song but watching this video...
FraKir Sch	Sucks
T Lee	That was great
Alistair McCready	I am not sure that when Trent was writing this, he was thinking of Johnny,? one of the songs that really sounds as if it was written for person that covers it
Ichigo Kurosaki	When your grandpa goes to get ice cream
Joe The Juggalo	"One of the most beautiful but saddest songs he did. He knew it was his time. 
It's like David Bowie before he passed he did that one last masterpiece with his song Lazarus."
DRM Gaming	I still can’t listen to this without crying
Risto	I'm afraid to die because I'm terrified of how God will judge me. I hope I start a new chapter in my life starting from the very second I press enter to send this comment.

CORTES MISTOS [OFICIAL]	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Kolja Wendt	One of the most emotionally powerful songs ever written! 🥺
Josef Niklasch	It’s amazing….He knows how to say good bye…
flowering_nonbinary	"I couldn't find my comment, so I'll make a new one.
 My comment was about my encounter of this song while in my darkest times. I've struggled with depression and self harm for many years and I thought that no one can understand how I felt because I was so alone and sad. One day while doing my cutting session, I put on a playlist of sad songs and this came up. I started to listen to the lyrics a lot closer and I started to tear up. A song, by someone who experienced sadness and expressed it in the most touching way that made me realize that I wasn't alone.
I later commented on how touching the song was and my situation, and a bunch of nice people said that they hoped I get better and that they'll pray for me. Those comments and this song made me stop my bad habits. Today, I still struggle with thoughts of self harm but I manage and distract myself from doing it.
I'm now 1 year and 3 months clean"
Eros Edling	This is one of my favorite songs ❤
justinian the great and nerd	"Turns this on.
Plays loop.
Refuses to elaborate further."
Seb Collexts	This song hit different. I started choking up a little bit
Lorena Croci	Such a heart breacking
Jesse Cleland	Some of these comments insinuate the idea that the commenter (if that's a word) doesn't know this isn't his song. Though in my opinion he did it better. God bless
Peeweedinosuar	It's got to be the coolest gut wrenching feeling ever than to create a song that ended up being covered by Johnny Cash at the end of his life.. Holy fuck!!
carly	A true masterpiece! I cry every time I see it! No matter how much time has passed...God bless you Johnny! 🤗
Tammie Almany	Everyone you love goes away in the end ... Feeling sad today 😢
Preston Mescher	What a man's man he was...a true artist and a conquer of the time no grave can keep him down he lives in the radio now
J V	"This is the worst cover ever and I fucking hate Johnny Cash's narcissistic take on this song. He wears a crown of thorns? What? 
The original hits so much harder emotionally dealing with the pain of addiction and trying to numb emotional and spiritual pain. Johnny's version is just him putting himself on a pedestal before he died.
Hopefully, everyone here knows that this song was originally written by Trent Reznor and performed by Nine Inch Nails. If you don't know that, do yourself a HUGE favor. Listen to or watch the video of NIN playing this song live...."
AlkaTras401	that feeling
AlkaTras401	its so good
Lyssa Leigh	I would find a way.
AJvsTheWorld	It doesn't even sound like he was singing, he was just speaking from his heart.
Edmond Leonardo Siahaan	🙏🙏🙏
Dr.potato_aim	such a good song and i think done better that 9 inch nails
Susan Wheelington	Last words of the song “I would keep myself, I would find a way” suggests to me the worldly self would find a way to keep (know the truth) of the hidden spiritual self (our true eternal self revealed when we come to Jesus through the power of the Holy Spirit.)  And in the end that’s what matters as the empire of dirt is fleeting and doesn’t last. My take anyway.  Beautiful Johnny Cash Thank You
Anthony Carlisle	"I'd have been balling 😭 in the recording room... 
*sniffling* ""Yeah Johnny, great first take! We're good!"""
Chewy Mcman	2022 if you're still listening to this embrace today because tomorrow isn't guaranteed. God bless 🙌
MrHulsi	.......... pfffff no words.
Paul Klaase	When someone you deeply love is dying slowly, you do look to heaven, to God and say, “stay the hell away from me y’hear”. Hurt is pain, and it leaves a stain. In this song he tells us you’re not alone.
t77snapshot	I turned 40 this  year and have been suffering from depression for almost 2 years now. This version of Hurt hits hard in my soul. I don't want to hurt anymore.....
mikeshogunlee	"So many people misinterpret the 
""I'll make you hurt""
Line."
Elaina Henry	This is so sad
Mr Penrose	WoW and as in getting towards 50 this song just hit a bloody nerve...
Qardo	"Nine Inch Nail original: A young man reflecting of his life and realizing he is going to burn out before even living. If he keeps living the life of sex, drugs, and rock & roll.

Johnny Case's Cover: Johnny reliving all the moments in his life and all those who left him behind. Wondering if it was all worth it.

Both equally powerful and both hit you differently."
Ryan Booth	Such a masterpiece of work, the depth in these few minutes is unbelievable.
Jason Statham	he speaks about the karma

don't stay in this world.
But then I have to look to Jesus again

in winter i often look into the fire and into my loneliness.
music can give warmth, remind of love
and bring death to life.
jesus should manage everything!"
Alex Staniforth	I honestly think I like to be sad

Shanta Paalin	"to know what he sings:

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel

The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts

Johnny Cash didn't need anyone to do it for him... he done it himself"
Rodrigue Gomez	The best…
tabularasa7711	Johnny Cash, the living legend in American country music, stood at the doorway …. Death’s door…. he had something to say…. A memoir in 3:48 — and it cuts so straight to the bone… shivers in the sweaty cold….  You can have it all….  But where will you be at last. Those who love you and don’t want you to go… even if they hold your hands and beg you not to leave…. When it is your time, your soul will exit the body….  And so while we’re here, let’s make a living creation and spill our wine and tell our stories… and lean into our individual dreams and our collective destiny will be all the richer
Marco Trüper	Oh ich liebe es herrlich Gänsehaut

LeadGravity	You could be depressed rich or impoverished which one do you prefer? The rich that suffer often paint a picture like you don’t want to be rich now keep in mind you don’t want to have the $10,000 to fix your teeth withheld from you, you don’t wanna live in your parents basement. So this rich makes you unhappy bullshit is a goddamn lie he’s unhappy because he doesn’t have a purpose and he’s lived his life in Fornication And selfishness rather than love. That has nothing to do with money folks that’s just a bad fucking decision

Joseph Cazzuto	I'm here because the new Squidbillies episodes suck and I'm really sad. It's like my best friend just passed away and everybody is trying to push a lame imposter on me to fill the empty void.
Zoltán Róth	Every time I hear it, tears well up in my eyes. <3 My eternal gratitude and thanks!
ToxicTed	"Rarely does a cover of a song eclipse the original but this is clearly the case with ""Hurt.""  Rick Rubin was the genius who introduced Johnny to this Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) penned epic.  Johnny then turned it from a young man's lament into a true ""end of life"" retrospective.  While Reznor initially didn't warm to the cover, once he saw this video he said, ""This is not my song anymore.""  I cannot watch this video without tearing up and usually it starts when June Carter Cash appears on the stairway.   A haunting, soul-searing rendition by an American legend.   RIP Johnny, you left a hole in the musical world when you left us, barely a year after recording this."
MALONE DICK RIDES AGAIN	"I wear this crown of thorns
Opon my liers chair  
Full of broken thoughts
I can not repair. 

This is a song that describes my life. Johnny wrote because he lived this life. Alone watching his kingdom fall but being reserved. I will stand in the light rather than hide in the dark."
George Scaggs	Waiting on the man to come around...2022...still pure blood👍

José Ospina	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Andre Johnson	Cash is no stranger to pain. He was down and out, nearly forgotten and was able to resurrect his career with the help of Rick Rubin and this little gem. His version brings another whole new dimension to Reznor classic track. This makes me appreciate the original even more. They are both amazing!
George Jr.	This song never fails to make me tear up

Valentina Pshenichkin	I used to run across the room to turn this off when it came up on an auto-generated playlist.  It's a beautiful song, and that's why the algorithm knows I like it, but I didn't feel comfortable playing it until my kid could use the right words for what he tried to do to himself.  Now he's 9 and he can, and he loves this song too.  Other people have thoughts and feelings like he does.

Virgle Nucoma Bottomlee	LEGENDARY
Ryan Rickman	"I see my grandfather in me in this song. I'll never forget the day he turned to me and looked me in the eye and said "" I can tell you have, it I can see it in you"" he was a hard working man and didn't talk much. He was a man of few words and only talked about what's necessary. I was only a teenager at the time and very onery. Denis the menus self willed type. I listenen to what people say, but usually do what I want to. A very ""No body is going to tell me what to do"" attitude growing up. So for him to do that, froze me in my tracks. I didn't suspect  him to be the type to see the spirit inside of me."
Phildo	1 of the greatest to ever do it! The man proved he could do it all from rebel rousing drinking tunes to emotional ballads that grab at your heart strings
Angel Braun	I have nothing like Cash but I’ve lost it all…. Everyone goes away in the end is a timeless line in the song and yes I know it’s a cover but a heck of one….

John Matteson	I just realized that the great Johnny Cash believes in reincarnation! Kinda gives me hope! Extremely beautiful song
Calvin Chu	"Johnny had an older brother, Jack, whom he was very close with. Jack got kill in work earning more money for the family, while Johnny went fishing. Their mom felt strange that day and told Jack to fish with Johnny but Jack refused wanting to earn more money for their family. Jack was almost cut in half in an accident at work that day and died. Johnny blamed himself that he could've saved Jack's life if he convinced his brother to fish with him that day. Cash said he felt guilt throughout his life. He carried that all his life, I hear this in this song and I wonder if Jack is his ""sweetest friend"", whom he will ""let you down"", I will ""make you hurt"". ""I am still right here"" even though Jack is gone. There is such yearning for redemption."
Calvin Chu	This song makes a lot of people emotional, cry, including me. And sometimes I am not sure why. Nine inch nails doesn't make me cry. But Johnny Cash does, there is something about his voice, what he was going through, the images, it is about although he had accomplished so much, none of this really matters, everyone goes away, he expresses his sufferings, his struggles, the people he hurt in the past, his powerless at his old age, the wrongs the he can't correct, he has no control, and that the things he valued so much no longer matters to him, despite being a music legend and he still wanted to start over to do things better, there's guilt there
Steve French	If you're listening to this in 2022 chances are you are a good ol boy!!!!
Calvin Chu	so powerful

You have fun with that..

Gerçek olan tek şey
The only thing that's real
İğne bir delik açar
The needle tears a hole
Eski tanıdık acı
The old familiar sting
Hepsini öldürmeye çalış
Try to kill it all away
Ama her şeyi hatırlıyorum
But I remember everything
Neye dönüştüm?
What have I become?

My sweetest friend
tanıdığım herkes gidiyor
Everyone I know goes away
Sonunda
In the end

And you could have it all

seni yüzüstü bırakacağım
I will let you down
canını yakacağım
I will make you hurt
Bu dikenli tacı giyiyorum
I wear this crown of thorns
yalancımın koltuğunda
Upon my liar's chair
Kırık düşüncelerle dolu
Full of broken thoughts
tamir edemiyorum
I cannot repair

The Forsaken	That last minute is just so powerful, you can almost feel as if a big bomb goes off on every beat.....NIN are legends, just as this man was. (we all have good and bad, shame, sorrow, etc. To admit, for me, the most powerful of things to do.)
Utahskiing1	Just cleaned out a storage locker full of my mom's stuff from her life and from people who she had known when she was younger. It brought back this video and it's poignancy. Cash was so talented  and really portrayed this tragic part of life well.

Blah Blahblah	Just finished watching videos of singers then and now. And they mostly lost something over time. They lost the aingst they once had, that dripped from the speakers. This man, never lost his connection to whre it hurts and he still sounds good,great better than ... I hope to age just a bit as well as he did.
lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Emergency, there are genocides happening like during WW2.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries.*  1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  Hitler was a Catholic and never excommunicated.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings like against the Jews, gays, war objecters(war objecters coming soon as they are starting WW3), and other perceived undesirables as in Nazi Germany.  *People were rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the smell taken out (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  Most of those rounded up were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast when he was asking what the concentration camps they were building were for, then later they circulated that he had been fired a year before the event, now said to be the location of the most covid(corona) cases. *Corrupt. 
Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!) 
 According to Revelation 18 this group wears scarlet(Cardinals), and purple(Bishops).  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs.  Through time nations and peoples have not been able to sell their goods to other nations with out this mark.  According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse 13:18 says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).   It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei). 
 Latin letters have a number associated with it, just like Hebrew and Greek.   Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working together in self interest, not in the interest of the people.  The earth belongs to the people collectively.  1John5:19 is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.  Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!  God for warned about these things happening. 
Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China saying that they are the ones committing genocide.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA   The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!  Some Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 nations have had war every year, in fact there has probably never been a year or probably a month where they were not in a war. 
 Government mandates vaccine for businesses over 100 people, and then Revelation 18 Church people, sabotage, boycott and quit, thus destroying the business, and your suppressors take full control again, enslaving you.  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  Every time I see the idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica, I know that Rome is a complete fraud(Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).   Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies.  Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.  In US it was approximately 5 governmental agencies and the President.  The President orders all businesses with over 100 people to force the vaccine on their workers.  Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage(Canada flooding?), boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy businesses.  The businesses that were trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19.  Amazing how all these things came a long as Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 is being exposed.  The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, just before this pandemic. Donald J. trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.(so called man of justice)  There was rioting and protests all across Europe just before the pandemic.  Italy, the seat of Rome was the first place to long term lock down, fill their Churches with dead bodies and the first to enforce the covid vaccine pass.  The Pope had a meeting with mayors and governors from around the world under the guise of environmentalism pre-covid.  
 Read Exodus20, Deuteronomy5 and Acts15 and see about the Bible's view of idols, and you will see that it is Rev/Apoc17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 has caused people to break God's law by using the beast's money.  Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John5:19 OWO.  People calling it the NWO, should think, isn't this the same as the genocide and war of WW2?  Think! 
Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?!  All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  There is two realities playing out.  1. A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  2. Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  Reality 1 is for public consumption, where as reality 2 is for Church and State. (John McAfee, the computer anti virus software owner was put to death(in Spain) to hide this. Think of which reality is really being talked about!  God be with the people of the world as they unite against the beast system.  *UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.*  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia, supposedly for a rodent infestation.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison. 
 Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world through force until the birth of the US and the French revolution, which ended the Bible's prophecy of 1260 years of domination by Rome.  Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not (Sun)day).  A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other side had an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads stacked up.  Ste Bartholomew's massacre.  In the Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and governments to kill steal and enslave.  *Urgent necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public!*  Through history the Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and the leader of the exterminations was Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler.  Most exterminations of WW2 were in Catholic Poland.  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  Poland, Australia have WW2 like concentration camps.  Omicron is a Greek letter like the last letter omega which has the O sound.  In the the original Hebrew of the Bible there is two words את untranslated in other languages in Genesis1:1.  In Revelation it tells you who the את is.  It has been hidden in the Greek to deceive you, as the complete Bible was in Hebrew and the Alpha and Omega(first and the last) of Revelation is really the את of Genesis1:1.  א(aleph) is the fist letter of Hebrew and ת(tau) is the last, and the one represented as את was in the beginning with God.  Omicron is a code word for omega.  Omicron is information exposing the את being changed to Alpha and Omega.  The false Church wars to protect its false doctrines. *Determining the future by movies, is pure stupidity.*  Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being gassed!  Alex Jones is quoting German and Italian sources...the perpetrators of previous genocide.  Brilliant.  Media is supposed to be unbiased, so media not allowing comments is corrupt and no longer worthy of consideration.  Revelation13:15,18:5. America under attack from with in by Rome? They don't dispute with words they kill to hide things.  !?((??)"
Safi Mo	Resonates with me as I’ve knocked on death’s door and have my second life started.  There is no one that can do it like Cash.  God’s blessings Sir…
Kelsey	It hurts just listening to it. You can feel his pain.
another friend	I can only imagine how he would feel about everything that has happened hear lately... i wonder  if he would be against mandates... we all.know he would be against the mandates but probably be skeptical of the vaccine and would probably call out Biden for leaving our men and women behind enemie lines...

SiMBi 0ZZA	Мя не знаю о чём поёт этот старик, но делает он это так проникновенно, что мя даже несмотря на языковой барьер, словно бы понимаю о чём он пел, не столько на уровне смыслов, сколько на уровне эмоций.
Adam Pierce	One of the greatest of all time!
Franz60	This song leaves me speechless. One of the greatest songs about overwhelming feelings, a swan song for the past and sadness about lost opportunities. A painful musical legacy. Thank you, Mr. Cash.
Tom Desposito	"I love this so much and posted a few times on this but one thing eludes me. Was johnny a nine inch nails fan and one day he was listening to the original ""hurt"" and said to himself ""damn i have to call trent and ask him as i just love this song""? I'm a huge NIN fan from when I was 12 back in 92....now im not saying its impossible for this man to like NIN but it still seems odd lol. Im gonna google and if anyone knows the reason please tell"

Roland S	Of all the covers that he could do, I think this one really sums up what he went through and the footage is definitely touching. I especially love that June Carter is right there   watching over him just as she has for all those decades. If that's not true love than what the hell is?
Luke Williamson	"He literally recorded this the week his life long partner and wife died.
Do none of you know that?"

Dobas Dobas82	"hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way 
:P"

JESUS Name Above All Names	"12.31.2021
I think there's another version of this song, sung by Johnny; but with different clips.🤔 
I remember watching it a couple years ago.👊 Great voice & man. I'm overjoyed that he eventually got right with God.👑🛐
I remember back in the early 70's & his funny song: A Boy Named Sue. What a hoot!!😄"
Mr beast	Rip Rest In Peace legend
Brian Hoffman	Still feel..
NewJerseyJay Creating Homes! 	He wasn't unhappy, He enjoyed life. His wife was his everything, and when she passed he lost everything that was truly real.
Erwin Forbragd	Best Goddamned rep of the downtrodden and the common man ever.
Meoff Jack	He knew death was knocking on his door. And everything he had meant nothing it was just trinkets of his life and time on earth. Nothing at all you can take to your grave. He didn’t want any of it. All of it meant nothing anymore.
Bryson Hieb	Johnny cash reminds of my neighbor across the street who is like in his mid 60s they speak practically the same so this song really gets to me sometimes because I’m really close with my neighbor.
Bambi AusDemWald	johnny nice cover shice :)
Afonso Neto	31/12/21 entra ano e sai ano e eu continuo me achando um lixo.
Fred B	We got your back. You are a Johny Cash
Derek Patterson	The man in black, what a life!! 9 inch nails version to me signifies people over dosing on drugs and is very special, Johnny's version growing older and having family and friends pass away changes everything about the song, that's where I am now, getting older and I've lost more than a few...:(
Archtakerfraud666	One of the best songs of all time!
Finding PoohBaby	Love you Johnny
HistoryNews	This song reminds he how I wasted my life and I should do better to friends, I should have been nicer to my parents “if I could start again one million miles away”
Heck	Ya'll can say what you what you want but this is the saddest song ever performed
June Been	"Originally written by Trent Reznor, but this is Johnny's song. This is all our song, those of us who see our own demon and cast it down. My heart weeps for these future generations. The knowledge is there, but they see it not. How do we recover from this point? Truthfully, we don't. Enjoy what peace and freedom you have while it lasts. It wans daily...daily. Our children have become our own demise. ""Sad, but true."""
My Amadeus	"It is disgusting how many people jumped on this nine inch nails classic after Johnny passed away
They remind me of the millions of Earnhardt fans who suddenly appeared when the ""Intimidator"" tapped out turn 4 of Daytona

Sterling Marlin is cheap Nascar whore 
I lmao when the mfer broke his neck later in the season. 

Moral story ?
Do not fuk with the Earnhardt's 
Lest we forget Kerry Earnhardt practically murdered Blaise Alexander at the start finish line in Charlotte. 
In kerrys defense at least he won the race ."

Amen Amen	Damn. That is so brilliant.
nikhil mahendranath	"Someone will come along....

GrandAdventurerLost	Every time I listen to this song I find myself remembering December 2016. I was walking from the courthouse after finalizing my divorce. I had just ended 10 years of marriage with the person I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with. I was sitting in my car, paralyzed, shell shocked when this song came on. The lyrics so perfectly described the pain I was feeling in that moment. It made me feel understood. Knowing my trauma was real and that others had felt the kind of loss I was going through helped me start healing.

Robert	Brilliant.
SugaryPhoenixxx	For some reason this hits so much harder from an old man. When young people talk about pain, they usually don't know what real pain is. & I say that with all do respect. People experience different levels of pain throughout their lives. Young people have not had a full life experience, so everything feels like the worst pain imaginable because they have nothing else to compare it to. When you are old, you have experienced all that the world can throw at you. Johnny Cash is a legend.

MrMarianoamigo	iconic
Max isi	Huge Classic !
Jonathan BarSela	It's like a musical auto-eulogy, similar to Freddy Mercury's The Show Must Go On and David Bowie's Blackstar, except that it's actually a cover of a Nine Inch Nails song. Beautiful.
King Slonzirelli	Absolutely class, sheer class
amyworldandlove	❤
Japan Air Carrier	This isn't the best cover of this and the poor man's been dead for nineteen years. Isn't there a Turo commercial where a jew producer buys an nice car for his adopted black children that we can all watch and feel good about?

luis	The men, Have A Star In Hollywood.
Basement Prophet	"I remember when I finished my highschool and in the yearbook I named Johnny Cash as my Idol.
It is his connection to his music.
Perfectly described in this song.
One tries so hard to leave a mark as an artist.
You try to create something big.
And in the process life is drifting by.
I put this theme in some songs of mine.
Like hidden paths leading to the truth of my art.
I will always catch a tear listening to this peace of music history.
Have a blessed new year"
Audra Snider	I know this will sound strange, but my husband always sings along to this song to my 2 month old son and he falls asleep within a minute of hearing the song. Thank you Johnny Cash for helping my son sleep soundly.
Jose Mendoza	What Johnny and Rick Rubin created those 10 years before he died is nothing short of genius.

luca fenili	This song is so crazy sad. But I'm so drawn to it. Now that I'm old I can so relate to it. And it makes me so sad. One day u are young with no care in the world and just like that. It's all gone. And you start losing all the people you care for the Most. And that makes it even harder.

Fionnbarr Casey	Man, James Mangold could not have decided on a more fittingly epic song to use for the first trailer of Logan. Perfectly captures what the film is about- a man having lived a long life and now on his way out and reflecting on it all
Troy Lee	A fitting song from a life rich with experiences both good and bad
Colton Harland	Still a great cover 👌
xXDeadWingsXx	My brother sang this song a few weeks ago, when we had a small karaoke-night. It was nice, it was sad...and now when I hear it, it haunts me: my brother was diagnosed with braincancer not 2 weeks ago...everytime I hear this song, I cry and I laugh, because not only is it a very sad and reflective song, it reminds me so much of my brother, struggling with this nasty thing :/

Michele Conley Eckert	I love Johnny!  I used to work at Howard and Phil’s.  When I’d wear my bulk wranglers, bulk silk blouse and bulk cowboy boots.  Old men would say Who died?  I’d say it’s my Ode to Johnny Cash.  Haha.  I named a group of rescue kitten after him. 1 was Johnny, 1 was Cash, 1 was June.   My parents loved his music, so I grew up listening to him.  RIP Mr.  Cash. 😪😞✌️❤️🙏🦋

David Kelly	I know exactly what he is going through I've got that pain and time ain't no healer but my daughter and beautiful family saved my life because I thought if i go to my cosmic soul m8 she'll be waiting for me overdosed on tranquilizers and booze  and woke up 2days later because my baby came to me and said you're breaking your last promise you made to me that you will be there for our daughter and I  could actually see myself lying on my bed looking down at myself but she kissed me and said it ain't your time and  Brooke needs you you're her mum and Dad now raise her to be the leader she is and I jumped in beside my daughter and hugged her until we fell asleep but I told her the next day and she cried and cried and said Dad you're all I have and the person I come to for advice you're the only Dad I'm ever going to have and you were going to leave me alone and I told her,her mum brought me back to you and the love I felt that day was overwhelming I've never felt love like that except when She was Born,we  lost my heart on the 7th of March 2020 to sudden unexplained death in a young adult and she was the fittest person I knew jogged every morning at 6am for an hour came back to wake me and my daughter up for work and school I couldn't believe she passed like that I could understand if she used drugs or drink but she only had a glass of wine with dinner so how fucked up is this world always the good go young she was the most beautiful unselfish person you could ever have the privilege of knowing but I had the privilege of being loved by her and loving her back and she gave me the most beautiful gorgeous intelligent daughter any person would be grateful to have thanx babygirl I miss you so much xxx

phil g	I went to a Johnny Cash concert when I was 13.  I don't think I'd ever been so excited in my life!   I loved him then and  five decades  later I still do.

Ryan Johnson	One thing I love about this song. You can have all the money and fame. Life will catch up and you see his eyes. He lived it. But life goes on. God bless the man in  black.
Slippy Jones	"The most awesome thing about this song is... It only took a rebel country musician to cover a Trent Reznor song, to give OVER A BILLION views! Trent should be happy that his songs are so heart-felt. ""Something I Can Never Have"" is another GREAT Reznor ballad. Trent Reznor is one of my favorite songwriters. He wears his heart on his sleeve."

colin duggan	You only go around one's make the best of life
Gratefully Recovering Hypodermically Speaking	RIP Dorissa my angel
Brett C	"My favorite thing about this song is how despite everyone hearing the same lyrics  different ppl can come away with totally different readings and all are more or less equally valid.
Similarly, I also love how johnny’s version makes me interpret the song slightly differently compared to the OG Trent Reznor/NiN version even though it’s essentially the same exact song coming from two very different artists."
Angelia Satterfield	I am so thankful that the Good Lord Has blessed me so much today. I have my brother in for my Hirthday and Christmas..  the Lord has  answered my prayer. I stopped smoking right away I couldn't believe it.. he is real ppl..  take care and  God Blesss you all.

Мастер Комментатор☝🏻	Был момент моей жизни,когда я занимался тем,о чем поёт Джонни 👏🏻Каждый день ранил себя.. Слушая её,я вспоминаю с некой ностальгией тот этап жизни. И она напоминает мне о том,что я справился. Светлая память этому человеку,который своим творчеством внёс довольно значимый вклад в жанр белого госпела+кантри. И на конкретно меня,его песни производят гипнотический эффект. Снимаю шляпу 👏🏻👍🏻

Guilherme Ramos	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Victor Cabrilana	Logan and Punisher! 😭
Brian Earner	I can't see anything anymore
Wastelander138	I remember where I was when I first heard this version of the song. I was in my house and MTV was on. I was just pottering about not really paying attention. Then I heard the opening lyric and instantly knew the song. I stopped still and watched. Transfixed by the images, the sound and the voice. I was awestruck. Cash and Rubin had taken a song about addiction and self loathing and turned it into a song about a man at the end of his life and filled with regret. It took on a whole new life. Kind of ironic considering not long after, Mr Cash was no longer with us. It's a bittersweet track. Beautiful and haunting. RIP to The Man in Black, and thank you for sharing your gift with us.

Ken Adams	Thank you Trent for writing this about your pain and allowing Johnny to express his same battles as you did.  Being such a huge Johnny Cash fan, he has managed to be involved with two of my favorite bands of all time. NIN and U2.  Between all 3 of them, their songs helped me through my adolescents like you wouldn't believe.  Playing Wish every morning getting me pumped up for every game during High School.

Amanda	This song and video used to scare me as a child but now that Im older it makes me emotional 😢
ultima579	My grandad introduced me to Cash. I’ve never looked back. One of the best storytellers of all time.
jadyn westcott	Have you ever hurt someone so badly and there was no way you could fix it. That you just have to live with their hate as what you did to them just eats away at you . this happened to me. I told a close friend's darkest secret and I felt so bad about it that I told her I did. Now I have to live with her hate, knowing I'll never be forgiven. At least i'm young, only 17, so I hope that when i never hurt someone in that way again.
Anissa	love the story of Trent Reznor listening to this for the first time in the studio sitting there with Zack de la Rocha from Rage. Trent wasn't sure about him doing a cover of it, didn't want it to be to gimmicky, but apparently he and Zack were in tears by the end of it. Hmmm

YURAKAPTIV	Any Cash fans should go check out a song by Riddy Arman called Spirits,Angels, or Lies......I prefer the live solo version on the Western AF channel.....It's about her dad's death, and Johnny's death, and a story that connects them.

No one is perfect and we dont have a 2nd try at life, so   cherish what you have been given and live like it will all be gone tomorrow. Thank you Mr. Cash! And you too Trent Reznor!
MID-CARD JOB GUY	Johnny cash is impressively bleak and poignant. it fucking rocked when it came out - within a hailstorm of rock and metal it found a home and moreover you normal mainstream run of the mill types started liking it and getting it all wrong. as you do. Johnny cash was forced to play this and sing this song just like black people were forced to plough your field and carry pyramids on there back to Georgia. worse thing is the people down in Georgia didn't like old Johnny cause he a white man -fuck that white man they play guitar on the walls. but yea its NINE INCH NAILS you easily offended fuck

If he weren't who he was it would almost be a suicide note... 
Some people are going to be angry by that statement .... But they have never been to the bottom of the WELL of despair and loneliness when those you love and who gave you STRENGTH and PURPOSE are ALL ALREADY GONE ON AHEAD..."

kira sussane	This video is hauntingly beautiful.
XRYXIX	This song/this cover will always pluck at my heartstrings it feels like
David Kelly	This song should touch everyone's heart that listens to the emotion of a man cleaning out his past before his own passing,it's true money may make you happy but if you have the love of someone,then you're the richest person alive,at the end of the day if all you can leave is an empire of dirt but have had the love of someone the feeling of emptiness when they're not with you the butterflies in your belly knowing you're about to see them that's being rich,of you've had this feeling you'll know but i pity anyone whose never had that.They may have all the money in the world but if you don't have love you have nothing
Janet Schneier	"HE was the greatest story teller of all times. Orange Blossom Special isn't the same without ""Harry the Hobo."" ""I Walk The Line"" was his signature song. He didn't need pictures, his songs spoke of his life (Hank Sr., also); this video is full of Easter Eggs. His discography tells the listener of his life. Some songs over-, some under- embellished was his way of relating those life experiences with his audience while still retaining some privacy. (BTW, June wrote ""Ring of Fire,"" she never regretted....she was married at the time she fell in love w/him; he never ""did time"" in A PRISON, although he did later meet someone from the audience of the San Quentin prison concert....Merle Haggard; etc, etc.) The Kennedy Center award ceremony for him was spectacular. Git out yer hanky. It's on YT."

Ayush Kumar	This song and Wolverine are a perfect match for each other

Igor K	"[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything


[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

I cried because you are so Damm fake and never came close understanding the love I had for you.  Go ahead and keep on breaking yourself.  I am not going to lose sleep over it.  😴 my conscience is clean I tried to do for you what you don't even realize you need for yourself.  Darlene it always catches up to you and pretty it'll all come crashing in on you when you see the only choice you have left is not even one that you want.  Enjoy your only choice when your time comes.  I wish you know ill will.  You only knew you had it when you lost it.

DGs W0	melhor música
dinoman - Jesus is Lord	Right! Pretty good! You listen to it(“hurt” original) when you’re young, and it would hit you deep back then) the bitter sweet teenage melancholy feelings) of your younger years of playing with your friends, talking with girls, awkward, finding out who you are, unsure feeling, you’re reminded of all that, and it’s pretty powerful…… then you see Cash’s video and song version when you’re much older… divorced, have your own kids that are old now and don’t really talk to you. You talk to your brothers and family once in awhile in passing, life has been hard, and is hard…. You start to think of when you were a younger man, had the world by the balls… life was actually very easy and fun back then…… cash’s version hits big time, choked up and teary eyed every time you hear it. A way deeper meaningful story now (with cash’s version). Life hard, But God is good though (just felt I had to mention that)

StealthAssasin 1Day	After watching the video closer you can see Cash could barely move let alone play the guitar or piano. This must have been a hard video to shoot. Cash is truly one of the Greats to ever do it, even nearing the end of his life he released one hell of a song.
Michael Hogan	The original version by nine inch nails was pretty ordinary. To be frank. The late Johnny Cash turned a shit song into a great song which showed the mark of a great artist

Mr. Gigi	Everyone i know, goes away in the end. May God, bless you.
Lily McAlister	sooooo potent!! In the end we all do hurt because you can not love w/out hurt. If u close your heart to pain, so it is closed to love. Just part of my interpretation.
john carter	One of the most emotionally powerful songs ever written..
Lans Ogle	So sad so awesome 😎

Nichole Lynn Edwards	Wayyyyy back when, around 17 yrs ago, i was on the phone with my doctor, trying to explain restless leg syndrome but all over my body. I said that it felt like such strong tension everywhere (medication side effect) and I said Its kinda like if I slam my legs down or hit my head on a wall, I might feel better.  Well, he sent the police to my home😆 and the officer and I are riding to the hospital and he had this cd playing.  This song came on and we both met eyes in the rear view mirror and laughed soooo hard!! I was far from suicidal and definitely wouldn't harm myself. It was just the physicians duty to make for certain that I was ok. This song now makes me laugh so hard remembering that day!!

Trevor Larson	"I constantly return to this song because it reminds me to work towards what is important in life: my relationship with God and my relationships with people.

Feck	Trent Reznor wrote the perfect song for Cash , years before he ever thought he would cover it . Both versions are a masterpiece of music . Two of my favorite artist . Rick Rubin is a genius for putting this together.

Olaru Sergiu	Good Blesssssssss You !!!!  you are my Song .....God Bless you!!!!!

asm75	Not a fan. Between this and Disturbed covering “Sound of Silence”… pretty awful.
TyDie85	The older I get, the more I realize I have grown & worked on myself in many ways. Yet, I still remain the young man I once was. This song is a cover, but could anyone in the 90's have imagined Johnny Cash would cover a NiN song?!
Russel Murphy	"When Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who wrote the song, initially heard that The Man In Black himself was doing a cover, he felt both honoured that such a giant in the music industry had decided to do a cover, but also felt concerned about how it would turn out.

After he saw this video and heard Jonny Cash's rendition, he said that the song was no longer his, and that now it belonged to Johnny Cash. 

This says a lot, especially about just how brilliant Johnny Cash was."
JauneShark	Glad Simmons got what he deserved
Kin Fui Lee	Logan 😥
Renay Sari	You can see and feel his hurt.  Sorry Trent, but I am loving this version better.
RogueJyn	True fame. Not like today's singers. This man touched people's souls with his music. I sound like a boomer but I'm only 23
Adam Delp	The man. The myth. The absolute legend. There will never be another Johnny Cash.
Christopher Owen	The videos of his childhood home really does show the meaning of you can't go back home. I tried to once and really understand what I think he was looking for.
Justin Case	🙏
Paragon	To make this even worse, his wife, the woman the final half of the video, died three months after the filming of this video, Cash dying four months after her
Xel	every man can relate to this. Im 36 but the part where all those flashbacks flash i feel its what ill be looking at 40 years from now if im blessed to make it that long. I just hope they are as epic. keep this comment alive , ill be back to let you all know how it went.
KANAMI YT	you can not change my mind this is the best song and music video in existence
joe simmons	Nothing tops the Nine Inch Nails Original Song. Who would of thought Nine Inch Nails Covered in Country.

Shujat Khalid	"And you could have it all
My empire of dirt

Everyone I know goes away
In the end

Really made me think about the grave, we're all going to end up in the same place. And all of our worldly possessions become useless. Best make the most time we have on this earth before it's too late."
The Juggling Riot Guy	This song hits different when Johnny Cash sings it
Frederick G.	We miss you everyday Johnny🙏❤️  the most spiritual song ever...
srujan00	What have I become, my Swedish friend?
super man	Powerful song.  It has all the words I ever wanted to say to that friendship that's now over 💔
Eternal Being33	A powerful song that never gets old. Much better than the original.

Majico Garcia	Yikes.....theres something so relatable about the lyrics.....
Thomas Board	🙏🙏 My bro John steven board aka 211 I love you bro 🙏🙏✌
John M	"Rage into the darkness of mankind’s lies and deception this earth is fraud top

ДЮХАGO69	MUSIC IN LOGAN
Jesus Paternina	La casa de papel ❤️
William Cain	Beautiful ☦️
Arka 2	Nine inch nails wrote an absolute masterpiece and Cash with his vocals just nailed his version
dennismcamara	💔
dennismcamara	💝
dennismcamara	💝💯
Cristian Rodrigo Azcurra	Una gran verdad para nosotros los mentirosos en situaciones
Catherine Reed	This version of this song calls to me when I am hurting worst.  Some days, that is Johnny Cash for me.  For other people, that will be someone  else.  He couldn't fix everyone, and neither can I.  The thing we can do is love you to bits without ever meeting you.  He did it, and I will too.  If you choose to carry on, please give him credit.
Flair Drakeyus	He makes this song so darn good!
Peter	Miss you Johnny!!!
Carla Fragoso	Mossa que voz linda nao mudou nada basta
Jesse Courtney	"I listened to this song today.
To see if I still feel."
Amar	I see my father in the heavens, looking at my son and me.
melloyello	I cry thinking about our elders. Slowly losing friends and family. Losing their spouse. You experience physical and cognitive decline. All you have is the memories.
wanderer	"Say no to drugs ! And you wont hurt,
 Thats what this song is about"
The Big Sign	Burn this world to the ground and get rid of it forever.
Mark 161	So fucking annoing how the original creator of the song, TrentReznor, did t get nearly as much attention for it as Johnny cash.
Vortex	Ill definetely listen this song If Im 80
Codex_Frog	"legit, this is the only song that i heard that makes me feel emotions. the tone, johnny cash's voice, just everything makes me feel so much for a reason i don't know.
i love this song"
Dardfrek	Thanks Johnny.  This is best.
Joern Huenewinkel	Absolut einer der besten 😀👍
Tray Daniel	Even though it’s not an 80s song, this version of this song should be the ending of Stranger Things. Hands down!
Angel	The thorns went deep and was horse whipped,do good be good love your bodies 5 a day vaccines
Bran O En	maaan this song. even after those years without you. Johnny.. thank you for all you've done for us
Reibai	véio caquetico
Lionheart Mind Explosion	.......i don't know what to say
Linda Oostvogels	Nee schat ik wil niet weg bij jou. Ik wil bij jou blijven maar ik wil een date of gesprek waarin we alles kunnen bepraten. Waarom wil je dat nou niet?
Эльдар Гараев	Ахринительная песня !
Jonas MMG	Incredible.
Adityakant Sharma	"Regards 
Gratitude"
Nate Homol	This is possibly the best remake of any song ever.  I remember liking Hurt when NiN released it, but really never thought about it much and it didn't have an impact.  This version changed all that for me.
Rach Pickle	This song was used in ad for child sexual abuse in my country. Was the first time hearing it.  Haunting.
Trav kip	This song is not good for kids it has inspired a lot of self mutilation! I was a kid.  i have burned and cut myself and a lot of the reason was music! Whether it was eraser burns, lighter burns, pencil marks, excessive knuckle/back popping! Or drinking/ smoking.
jacob bailey	"Him pouring the wine over the food saying ""you could have it all"" just crushes me to the core. People always strive for having everything but in the end when you have everything what else is there? humans are weak in the fact that we may be never satisfied with what lies in this world."
Trav kip	i should have took my own advice when i was young and first heard this. And appreciated what i was given and stop complaining. Good thing i am mid age and still able to do what i want to and done taking my life like it is a bad omen.
Shauna Valdez	The way June Carter looks at him @ 2:36....
David Masters	I listen to this everytime I want to punish myself for my mistakes
Alpha Force	"With all these views it's surprising how few of the people actually understand why Cash chose to cover this song... he covered this song because it perfectly summed up his legacy and he realized that - money, fame, success means nothing in the end. It was a song of repentance. You don't get to be a famous ""star"" in this world without literally making a deal with satan - but you can always repent and be saved by Jesus Christ as long as you do not commit the unpardonable sin. It would seem that Cash, knowing he didn't have much time left, did at least realize the error of his ways and came to repentance."
Ray Coleman	"Trent Reznor, who wrote this song, said when hearing Johnny Cash's cover, ""he owned the song"".."
kanix overdrive	This shit kinda hurt, like I cried on the inside
Lance Brinkman	I feel like there were 3 versions johnny and nine inch nails bit I cant remember the other maybe I'm mistaken?
Central Scrutinizer	"December 2nd, 2021.  Exactly 136 Million, 500 Hundred Thousand, Four Hundred Fifty views since posting on Sept 13, 2019.
This is a testament in and of itself."
Selecia Browning	I think it was a sad song he knew the end was near I love his music
wendyjensenmusic	I can't listen to this without tearing up. What a legacy he and his family left behind.
RJames Elliott	For me it reminds me to enjoy each and every day all of it.
Chris Kellison	We all have a reckoning coming.
tijuanawhorehouze	On repeat
Gregorio Mayancela	honestly I lost all my friends in I’m crying
Donald Williamson	Nine inch nails loved this more than their version cool and I can't argue as I'm a cash fan
Jeremy Lyons	How to get a million miles away? That is my question.
Michael King	The words on this resonate with me, admitting what you done wrong in life and being a let down for the people you care about, there is a spark of the original good person still there screaming out...
Popo Lélé	Just before the video, an add with a happy music... That was horrible to hear
Jorge Rejame	"That one fucked me up pretty bad...

it's like sadness and joy. A mix of feelings, it's not bad though... Thanks a lot King Johnny. You are truly missed..."
Jennifer Oloyede	I feel this to my soul
Jay sea	wow that is so powerful straight to the heart
Patrick Proost	This masterpiece, perfectly covered by Johnny, seems like it always have been written for him but then again, an image we all get see at some point...our empire of durt.
sean	Both versions are good in  their own ways and convey different messages, my opinion there isn’t better version over the other
Hicham samih	Il y a qlqs années j ai fait un rêvé.  Je chantais cette chanson en pleurant
Marija Trepic	💖💗💓🤍💜🤎
Christian Ignacio	Probably the best covered song, that's better than the original one.
MrStalkerkirya	Эхх мистер Кэш, всю жизнь обращаюсь к твоей музыке...
Adam Hale	This is no doubt one of the most haunting covers ever made. Hearing an old man with such a rich life in stardom reflect on it all before his death is a one of a kind experience, theres no other song like this in that regard. I can't even put everything it makes me feel into words.. but this song will for sure go down in history.
Josh Boggs	41 year old male here. I cried. Such emotion in this beautiful take on an amazing song. We love you Johnny Cash.
pathetiksquid 1nfinity leader	This gave me goosebumps
723dc	12-2-21 ... Rest easy Pops miss u dearly see u when I see u 6-30-77 -- 8-25-21
Light Shadow	More Painful is the LIES WE HAVE BEEN TOLD, going Against  Loveing Each other
Reginaldo Floriano	Que voz e essa mano tá doido música top demais
Rich Esquivel	"Johnny Cash didn't write ""Hurt"" but I don't care. In my opinion he made it his. Like ""Ring of Fire"" it's his and his alone. Sorry, I know he didn't write them but when he sings these songs he gives them a life nobody else does."
Brian R	So awesome
Suky Gill	Quite simply, incredible! Made me reflect.
Stephanie Handy	A rare occurrence where the cover is better than the original.
Doctor Yeetus	I had a friend since kindergarten, are bond was extreme, he was like family to me, that was 9 years ago, he was manipulative and he decided to betray me by taking away everything I had, friends, love, and the one thing that mattered the most, him. they are easily able to forget about me and move on but I cant, I have physical scars that he caused, I can never forget, people tell me to forget but I never can, every night I pray I don't wake up in the same place but rather in the playground of my old school 9 years ago so I could restart most of my life and fix my worst mistake and make my life worth living again, so i could find a way to make it better again.
Soundwave	This song and video always puts things back into perspective for me when I feel down.  Life is short and sweet.  Enjoy it and the company of those you love while you can.  Remember the good times, but never stop making memories.  Tomorrow is not promised. Rest easy Mr. Cash.
Bob Hunt	"*Investing in cryptocurrencies now should be on every one wise individual's list, in some time, you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.*
*Despite the economic crisis, this is Still a good time to invest in Stock and Crypto*"
Mr.Maka913	This song was written by Trent Reznor, But it came to life by Johnny Cash, I dont think this song would hit the same if it was sang by someone else, Johnny Cash had the perfect voice for this song
Johnty Fleming	breaks my heart this ,,but brilliant none the less
Murphy Blogs	To all have love keep yourself n have have it all lllll 👍😊😎
Betty C	Sublime
Chris Cooper	I loved the nin version but this one really drove the pain home deep and twisted in my heart so dark

Michelle McKenzie- Cruise	Self control over realistic relationships regiment
chambalguy	This is the most iconic song ever! Killing it with just 3 chords!
Giuseppe Plaitano	I love Trent...He wrote and sing this song but this version...I don’t find the words.
Henry Jordan	This is the greatest singer/song writer the world will ever recognize
43 45	Beautiful song and cover! They both represent different chapters of life. Love you both! Thank you!
Tocimah	When all come to understand what Mr. Cash was conveying, you will all weep and wail.....
Louis Martinez Jr	😔
DesignerFromMars	This must have been brought up already in the comments but the way he closes the piano cover and caresses it reminds me of when we close the casket of departed loved one. Perhaps this was his way of saying it’s time to put the music down to rest.
Proud Canuck	Love how there's isn't one single dislike! Johnny Cash is a legend! It does not matter the generation you are from, you can appreciate Cash's music!
jamie edwards	Not ashamed to have a cry  been Manley does not matter
American Husky	Greatest song(version) of all time.
tony alava	I love this  song 🎵 ❤
Steffi Sonntag	Mr Cash i Love you though you were also a Liar. Maybe WE are all Liars. Surely. But each lie has ITS weight . Your lie or my little lies Not much Not weighing heavy on ones shoulder. You never have been in prison. But you played there. Not a awful lie. I live you..respect . I lost my selfrespect CV or worth because of THE lies other creatures phantasized about me. I go under now. Maybe i can make i can make IT Millionen s of miles away from Here next Life. For this Life that IT was .
Higor Bittencourt	Beutyful song
Dan Stewart	My take away... The Man in Black shows all the things he made in his life through music and business... all broken and ending while he is at the end of his life.  This song might be saying it was all wrong to seek fame and financial success... maybe family is more important... most haunting song ever.
BISHOP	"That made me sad.
How about a mix/mash of Fulton Prison/Pinball Wizard to bring up our spirits.
Ignore the wardrobe.  The singer is awesome.

LeviTheBrute	beautiful and great, see you in Heaven Johnny
Kevin Martin	Did not know JC was such a big softball player... even as late as 1979
barry charles brebner	For YOU because WE ARE ALL in need of HELP, Jesus said  If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens, come to me and I will give you rest. Take the yoke I give you. Put it on your shoulders and learn from me. I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest. This yoke is easy to bear, and this burden is light.
Nathan Cantano	RIP Brother.
Dudo Klasovitý	the eternal wisdom of an old man being on the brink of losing the most precious thing…
Skeptical Observer	Absolutely Stunning.  Thank you Rick Rubin for helping Johnny Cash to express himself all the way to the end and for helping him finish his career and his life exactly where he deserved to be........ on top.
Bo Davis	Coming from someone who’s greatest fear is growing old and looking back at life with regret, even though this is a cover for me this is Johnny’s song
Coysauce	"0:06 - 0:23 (ostinato, vocals )
0:31 - 0:48 ( piano sustained)
0:55 - 1:05 (guitar strumming)
2:09 - 2:20 (harmonics or synth)
2:50 - 3:00 (piano pedal point)"
Brandon Rau	Even when he was old and grey, he could sing away!
Bastiet	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Neion8	"What have I become, my Sweedish friend?

Srbo AC/DC	"I`m pretty sure that the most legendary cover song is The House of the Rising Sun, written and performed by Bob Dylan, covered by The Animals.
That is also an iconic song, it`s been around forever and will be around forever.
And yet, it can`t even touch this.
This is more than music, this is LIFE, in all shapes and forms, this one hits you right in the soul and heart at the same time.
RIP, Johnny, your music will live on forever and a day."
Schadow *	sometimes the life is unfair
Aussie Drifter	"I think this song is one of his best ever, it strikes a deep emotional feeling in me & I thank him from the bottom of my heart for it.

Tevin Serlin	Playing this song to Nicholas Inch Niles omg I'm crossed. But I knew Trent, helped... Jonny Cash apparently liked it so he had to do it
Universe axiom	best part is that this is a cover song of nine inch nails song hurt, put aparantley when they found out the man in black was covering it they gave him the rights,
Weird Artworks	As a recovering addict, this song make me break down into tears. It is unnervingly familiar and unbelievably beautiful. It does more than resonate -- it transcends boundaries.
DrPeppaer DrPeppaer	We love you Chow
Matt Shepherd	Joaquin was the perfect choice for playing Cash.  at around 1:20 you can see the stark resemblance.
Kevin Ray	I cry like a baby y every time I watch this. Powerful stuff. Respect.
Gregory Bufkin	You have become an immortal musical genius remembered for a sensitivity that almost nobody got when you were alive. Giv'em hell in the Great Beyond, Mr. Cash!
Rita Legere	I hear people say this song is boring and  sad . How could they understand the depth of his loss and his need to to fond her.

And I don’t know what I did to my birth father but I can’t live with my self if I Did something wrong but I’m still standing stronger now because I’m alive and I don’t have to make sure that I’m fighting a losing battle with my dad because he doesn’t deserve to be a part of my life anymore but l hope he is doing well with his life because I’m being the better man and as for my sister even though I have a tendency to do so much to make her feel so bad I just want her now that I’m working on my own problems and I don’t want to have to deal with her drama but I love her"

Carmen Postulart	The amount of vulnerability in this song and the video is too much to process at times. Some people say that when our time comes, all illusion falls away and we are left the unvarnished truth of our lives....both beauty and pain that we have experienced and visited unto others. This feels like an accounting of ones choices and experiences.

They are waiting to help heal your hurt. You can! Be an inspiration, not a victim or statistic. You never know who you can save!

GOLDWING	I so hope there is an after life just so my old dad can hear this turn.  He turned me on to the man in black way back in the early 70s,  He loved Johnny Cash.
K	A song thatll never stop playin 💯

Lorelei Catherine	His emotions poured into this song used to make me absolutely sob as a child. Now, as an adult, I realize I had no idea how bad life would get, how much better it would be after that, or how sometimes we backslide and that’s okay too. But dangit if I don’t still sob like a baby hearing this song.
T. B.	Johnny we miss you!

funland	Kuka ei tykkää tästä kappaleesta?
Toni Suhonen	Wow
Nefuros	The pain and surreal emotion in Trent's version likely struck a chord in Cash's heart. True artists recognize others who pour their soul into the music. Hard to say what he was thinking but this was pulled from an almost polar opposite genre of music and now an entirely different story is told with the same lyrics. Both renditions are excellent. Both can be felt in a very deep way. What a song to end it all with. You'll live on forever Cash.

LoungeAct	The fact that Trent Reznor and Jonny cash teamed up to make this beauty without any attorneys or accountants or the labels involved is just weird al level

Phil Holroyd	Thank you
B e n	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Alex Thornton	never away my friend.................
Cheryle Phillis	Such true lyrics its called life and its journey for all of us the Tapestry of Life ..such a talent Johnny Cash you had it down pat..glad I saw you in concert such a dynamic voice and you sang the ballads with so much passion ..you deserved every cent you made ..RIP xxx

Андрей Ивашенцев	Он великолепнен!!!
Сергей Басалай	помогите  стране беларусь
Sven Horlemann	Play it at my funeral. Seriously.
Aldo Uriel	"The song comes out Aldo Uriel Fun Fest
in the scene when Uriel feels guilty for his bad actions by his 
friends and Sandra's while Norman's clown guards take him to Uriel to be 
chained to the theater until his death and Sandra is embarrassed and lashes 
out with Uriel for his rejection of friendship and because of his bad luck retiring to a teenage home,
and his friends Katia, Ronnie, Chayo Julio, Alejandro, Bruno, Armando, Maya, Leo and Alfred are 
entrusted by the same Norman guards on the same side as Mariela and Oliber and Uriel's other friends."
Lord Vader	This song was recorded only once, this was one of his only songs where it was perfected the first time he sung.
Matt Heller	Mid song when she starts to really belt it out, makes me smile. Every time. Then ties it up nicely with a little scatting. Never gets old
Alex 'Ferret' Voss	Just superb. Such a beautifully harrowing song of love, loss and regret. Much needed right now.
grochomarx2002	Truly one of the best covers of a song in recording history.

octav grosu	This song reflectiv on our day by day...Fact....here now and then :)
Alan Koning	When Cash ask Trent if he could sing this song he was flattered, when he heard it he was not. When he saw this video he never felt the same about what he felt was his personal song. After that he stated “I wasn’t prepared for what I saw, and it really then, wasn’t my song anymore.”

Jesse Elliott	Every time I put this song on I end up tearing up Johnny Cash was one of my dad's favorite artists I hear his voice and Johnny Cash's music. And every time it breaks me. But at least I'm still thinking about him I guess
Jason Storey	I love the dichotomy of the Trent version and the John version.. this is a great way to explain the way that art is subjective... these amazing pieces of music have completely different meanings just because of the performer and performance... it should teach people how to contemplate different meanings of songs and words. This is a great lesson in subjectivity
PeaTard	I wonder how long it took him to record his version of this song
Rohan Sreejith.	Can believe this is a cover. It fits him so perfectly
Greg Herman	how can something hurt so much an feel so good at the same time ?
Russell S Staten	As a nine inch nails fan I'm going to give the same reaction to this as Trent resnor did when after hearing this version proclaimed that it's no longer his song...it belongs to Johnny cash now...RIP the man in black
💯 ThatBee	Love you Johnny/ June cash!!! Rest In Peace ☮️
💯 ThatBee	I started crying twice watching this. It’s sooo powerfully and sooo just wow!!!! My favorite cover by a legend!!!! Amazing !!!!

sondra milam	Rip johnny cash we will miss you
Ryan Cowie	Respect to him because at that age singing lyrics like that must play with your emotions think about he’s talking giving it all and losing everyone he loves at that age your friends and partner will all be passing 1 by 1 it must be hard to live with it’s why I have always said I want to die young not very young but I’m 21 I want hmso many experiences by the time I’m 60-65 and hopefully something happens and I pass peacefully around that age I don’t think I could handle watching all my friends die off🙁 deep thoughts but I’m actually a very happy person tbh haha🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

zonta501	Jonny debitcard 👻👻👻👻🖖
Jr. Samples BR549	This song gives me chills every time I hear it.
Josh Shipley	This song was originally about Trent Reznors addiction w/ heroin and his feelings and thoughts during the time. Then Johnny Cash sings it and it takes on another meaning and both versions are insanely powerful. Ive played guitar for 30 years of my life and this song on acoustic, slowed down slightly and sang w/ passion could make Jesus weep. If Trent ever did this song in that structure it would be amazing. This song is one of the greatest songs ever written IMO and when you hear it its impossible not to feel some kind of emotion. Which is why this song is so amazing.
APPA PARANORMAL paranormal research	This song is so sad and makes you reflect on how fast life passes us by !!!
James Brown	This song reminds us all to appreciate our loved ones and true friends while we still can. God rest your peaceful soul Sir Johnny Cash.
Rume Kpadamrophe	My first time listening to this masterpiece
Das Jager	MR. Cash you shall never die, you shall live on in me, my family and everyone else you have healed with your music and life decisions.
David Shaw	My first show was this man in Toronto, Ontario, Canada🇨🇦 at the Canadian National Exhibition in the mid 60’s. It was pouring rain when the show was about start. Johnny Cash came out told the crowd that he will stay out here in the rain and continue the show if we all would stay. One stipulation was moving the rest of the band way back under the overhang at the back. Huge round of applause and the show went on. He stood out there in that rain and the show was mesmerizing. Pure class. Nothing but respect for this man doing that.

The Zamboni Master	Beautiful, 😔 I must now watch the movie (Logan) 2017. Thank you Mr. Cash. R.I.P…………..
Island_420	I can’t stand the original by Nine Inch Nails but anytime I hear cash’s version I tear up no joke. The video really makes an true impact and I feel drives the emotion of the song as well.. It’s funny how some cover’s end up being better than the original.

Яна Солях	кто от папича?
Aaron	Great song, but doesn’t come close to the original. Trent’s raw emotion and unbelievable use of tension in his composing is next to none. Huge compliment that Cash preformed it though. Has to make you feel pretty accomplished when a great like Cash covers your masterpiece.
Ricky Pisano	Remembering Johnny's life,  then seeing this video is so profound. It stayed with me for a long time. To say the least.  Trent wrote it but Johnny owns it now.  The most powerful video I've ever seen.

Ryan Cowie	I had heard this song a good few times and didn’t really listen it like it, it was a bit down for me but it came on the radio in my work the other day and I properly listened to the lyrics and now I’m hooked. Funny how when your growing up you hear songs and can’t appreciate them and then you hear music when you are at a certain age and can appreciate all the songs your mum and dad would play or you’d hear on the radio the ones you used to think were rubbish but now can appreciate for what they really are. Love it

Rocco Vanelli	Idk how a human being that has laughed,loved,and has lost. Can listen to this and watch the flash backs in this video, an not feel all flushed with emotion. I’m a 42 yr old “cis” male. An I can’t make the first ten sec without having to bite my lip and tear up. The pain in his voice is real. I wish I could find my June carter. The way she looks at him. Theirs was a true love. That transcends time.

Jim Torres	I'm done with the pain and ready to take my last ride I've lived long enough to see love die. I seen the two men who knew me better than me went away and I have nothing for anything I have done.  I've been betrayed by those closest to me now I am being betrayed by the very people I fought for.
rohan desilva	Logan...
CaptainSplash	This will make anyone tear up.  What a song.
rock racoon	Every time I see this...WHEEEW !!!
Gabriel Menezes	Nowdays this song is pretty much my reality, I've lost some friends in this year due to lack of contact, not having much time for myself to talk to them, fights, some mistakes.... way back when I was in school I started to have this empty feeling. Today i'm pretty much a loser in life, I can't find the success in what I like to do for living (being an artist and do character designs) and not many friends I have left even seem to care about me that much, even though I'm not gonna do anyting extreme to end this, I'll just live with this feeling hoping some day that this change for the better
Bode Ramage	I love johnny cash I went to his museum in Nashville and I seen that chair in the hurt video and his suits and I about cried🎙🎸📻🎤

JacQuelyn Medlock	"In my opinion he wasn't really talking / singing about past drug addiction but of the pain/ needles for managing the pain of his health issues as he was dying.
And knowing in advance, he looked back at his life& mistakes.  Does anyone else agree with me?"
Jose Rollano	Su obra maestra...grande señor Cash...

Bryan Trujillo	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Oswaldo Zuniga	the video was released on march 2003 and nothing in it exist anymore;  Cash's wife died two months later, Cash himself died 7 months later and the house was destroyed on a fire on 2007. it's not just the sadness in it but also the aura of sadness that revolves outside the scope of the video.
pierluigi biondi	Mitooooo
jaomiridle	YouTube POS
Chris Oreilly	It's crazy to think that his health was failing while singing this song. Rubin said sometime he couldn't even get the words out they'd sou d so raspy... The fact he took the song and sang it going through all the health problems he was facing, then the lyrics of this song with him singing just makes it so powerful. Especially know his life's story and what hes ben through. What a life and what a way to end it. He'll be remembered forever through all of us. Mental health is a real issue that many people ignore. Legendary cash.

Tom Desposito	"As many times I watched this amazing band playin in hthis video, I've never noticed that in the end the keyboardist moved because he was sitting right to the left of the drummer. I just noticed this lol and I probably seen this a 1000 times (at least once a day I play this video) and shows how many brain cells I have left lol, especially from all my rave/club days with ever letter of alphabet in drugs .....x...k...etc lol
P.s 
Wtf?? I dont know how i managed this, but the above comment i posted was meant for the animals video of ""house of a rising sun"" lmao. I do watch this video almost on a daily basis as well though."
Frank Smits	I'm now with covid in hospital. My oxidation sucks big time... With this I song from Mr Cash i pull myself throug. It a very very deep song En som of my friends can't even handle it.. Thanx Mr Cash! I understand the pain you were going through.

Now that life keeps knocking me down without mercy, I have no more tears to cry... I just have hands to throw 💪"

Richie not so rich	This is by far the saddest song ever when you see an old timer associating it with the end of his life and how he lived.
Terralynn Dockins	JOHNNY CASH GREAT !!!! LOVE ME NIN
I'mNotBehindYou	Knowing the story behind why Johnny covered this song makes it so much more meaningful. Johnny did a beautiful rendition of an otherwise bleak and depressing song.
akimboturbo	This keeps me off the drugs ,songs like this are a stark reminder of why I got cleaned up and thank anyone except God (that fkcer wasn't there)

jo 360	Truly a grate rip cash❤️⚰️👋🥺
Dead inside Mcgee	I will maintain this until the day I die, there is a serene yet mournful quality to Johnny’s voice. He’s always had it, it’s never lost his magic. May whatever good God’s above rest his soul.

Maik Mkm	Time is so precious, don’t waste it
me & you	Johnny Cash thought this song was about spilling a cup of Bosco,  he thought that can be so sad  but then he found out this song is about the day they took The Munsters of the  air just after two years.
Zero G	🐺🌹

Nancy Lauka	I had taken a wrong turn and was lost in my car so pulled over to a quiet spot to regain my composure. I turned on my radio and heard Johnny’s rendition of this song for the first time.I thought I must be hallucinating. I was shattered. And eventually found my way.
Cold Blaze	Now my comment doesn’t make sense because YouTube deleted the original post. Long live censorship I suppose?
Moha Kizko	♥️
Cold Blaze	He is a genius no doubt, but seriously he couldn’t write his own opus on his end ?
Cold Blaze	Oh I forgot to mention, ridicules wealth, poor guy 😭
Cold Blaze	Poor dude, a life of womanising, drug addiction and it is all summed up in the work of another artist. Man he did it tough!
Joseph A.	I don't cry at funerals but if they played this I would
Martin Mayer	Rick & Morty for ever! :-)
Graham Wright	Prior to this Johnny Cash was basically an artist who had fallen out of favour and into hard times. Producer Rick Rubin took this legend of a man and elevated him into what you see here, an incredible achievement from both of them. There's a brilliant film here detailing how some of this came to be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabwGiTWRVo&t=338s&ab_channel=Soulr R.I.P Johnny.

Néstor España	Absolutely awesome. Magnificent.
Alex_1729	"Johnny Cash was a drug addict. This song is about his regrets in life. In the 1960s, Johnny was hardly around for his wife and daughters and soon got a divorce due to his non-attendance. He was found nearly dead due to a drug overdose and had lost the most important thing: himself.

Cash's cover of ""hurt"" is about his fame, his family, and his drug abuse. At this point in his life, he realizes he has nothing. His life has been wasted and there isn't anything he can do. He spent all his time chasing fame to make him happy, but it never happened. The only thing he feels is ""the old familiar sting"" of his memories and empty shell of himself.

""Everyone I know
goes away in the end"". He has lost everyone due to his life choices, although he has remarried, his ex-wife, his children, and even his current wife are all different people and grew to be better people in their lifetime, while Johnny has nothing but an empty shell of himself.

""And you could have it all
my empire of dirt"" All of Johnny cash's fame meant nothing. He still is facing the same thing everyone else faces (old age, death, and depression). You could have all of what he had. His talent, his wealth, his popularity, but in the end, it isn't going to mean anything. He still feels empty.

""If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"" Johnny cash wants desperately to live a different life. Away from the drugs. Away from the importance. He wants to live a life where he remembers where his values should lie. Where he's there for his loved ones and himself.

He wants the listeners to know the mistakes he had made and wants us to learn from them."

Amy Quinn	Still here. Mum, Dad, John, my daughter's father, my friends - all dead. I'm an alcoholic and my GP told me I should be dead by now, four years ago. And I'd rather be. How can it be that good people die, and idiots like myself stay alive? This is so bitter. I should be dead. They should be alive. Still I'm able to post stuff on YouTube, but I shouldn't be able to. If there were a God, which I don't believe, surely he should let good people live out a happy life?
Marty Bilski	I love Johnny Cash forever

Nut Lange 	When June died, a part of him obviously died with her. It was only a matter of time before he would go to. In the end it wasn`t long. When one gets older, you reflect on life and what could have being.. I do.... RIP John/June. Great artists
Eduardo Sousa	Essa música combinou muito com o filme do Logan
scarlet	"I can't remember how old I was the morning they first aired this on MTV. But I do know it was Middle School. And I cried that morning before getting on the bus. 
This song will always hurt so good.
You can't not sing it and think of everything in your life. You can't not feel this song. He was a terrible husband, but he regretted it. And then he died not to long after this aired like months I think. And I cried so hard again."

John Loreaux	"You know, sometimes you just have to cry because.......life. You look back and wonder where the time has gone. The people that just went away. Some died but many just went away. You ponder your mistakes and wish you could do a few things over again. Spend more time with the people that touched your soul.  God knows I've let people down. Never wanted to but it happened. There is no other song that brings me to a place of brokenness like this song. A place where I just want to reminisce and go back to make it right. I always come back to this incredible, emotional, song of regret. Like these Trent Reznor lyrics say..... ""And you could have it all, My empire of dirt, I will let you down, I will make you hurt"""
Chris Saven	Great song, given away by writer after hearing this version. One of the of the finest expressions of regret, pain and acceptance in any format of human design.
undead Otter	So much emotion in this version. You can hear in his soul his sadness of losing his wife June. She was his savior in every way and he knew it 100%.  My heart breaks every time I hear him sing this, but I can not stop listening.
James Blanch	Thanks for this song it wad my brothers favourite song and we played it at his funeral and it will alwayd have a place in my heart very deep, he was a very confusing kinda guy and this song really speaks to me how he viewed things

Andrew Pataki	The most honest song I’ve heard in the last 20 years.Deep, sad as hell, I can find myself in Trent’s version, and I can imagine at the end of my story I will regret things I have or haven’t done.Beautiful, every time I hear it, my heart breaks a little bit, and tells me, do things what you wanna do, in the worst case I will regret it at the final countdown.Thanks Mr. Cash for this masterpiece, and all your legendary song in your lifetime!
Leslie Bell	It's a Sad Bastard song.
Chris Garcia	You know you’re a legend/myth when the original person who wrote and sang this song (Trent Reznor) admits publicly this isn’t his song anymore.
Wretch	Best cover song ever 😍

John Lopez	Resentment and Doubt can consume you and ruin your life and everyone else around you. If you can find peace, more than happy for you. For most people will never find it.
Riley Riolu	"I used to see this as a depressing song for when I have a meltdown, but... Now that I know the context, I feel like I know more of the context. Whenever I listen to this song, I think of these phrases... ""Was everything I've done, good or bad, worth it?"", ""Will I be remembered as what I wanted to be? Or will it be all be expendable?"", ""Will you see me as the same if you knew the true me?"", ""If I could start again... Will it be different? Will I find a way?""

I know these are extistental, but... It really wants me to think about myself... I will still live life to the fullest, but when my time comes, I will think about them... In due time."
lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Emergency, there are genocides happening like during WW2.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government* (2Corinthians4:4).  *Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries.  1John**5:19** is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.*  Hitler was a Catholic and never excommunicated.  *Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings like against the Jews, gays, war objecters(war objecters coming soon as they are starting WW3), and other perceived undesirables as in Nazi Germany.  People were rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the smell taken out (h#$%@3n)cyanide.*  Most of those rounded up were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.  *Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast when he was asking what the concentration camps they were building were for, then later they circulated that he had been fired a year before the event, even though he is still working.*  Corrupt.  Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group *if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)*  According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Cardinals),* and *Purple(Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom *(Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.*  Where are the Kings?  *The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions will come 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.*  The (cross or X) is on the shields of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs.  *Through time nations and peoples have not been able to sell their goods to other nations with out this mark.  According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the taw, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel, God put a taw(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse **13:18** says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the taw(mark) of the beast(Empire).   It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the anke, which was a symbol of power.* The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  *Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).*  Latin letters have a number associated with it, just like Hebrew and Greek.  *Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working together in self interest, not in the interest of the people.*  The earth belongs to the people collectively.  *1John**5:19** is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.  Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!*  God for warned about these things happening. 
*Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China saying that they are the ones committing genocide.*  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA   *The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!*  Some Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 nations have had war every year, in fact there has probably never been a year or probably a month where they were not in a war. 
 *Government mandates vaccine for businesses over 100 people, and then Revelation 18 Church people, sabotage, boycott and quit, thus destroying the business, and your suppressors take full control again, enslaving you.  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!* The Bible's book of Matthew mentions they would put you to death thinking they are serving God, that's how deluded they are.  Every time I see the idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica, I know that Rome is a complete fraud(Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).   *Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies.  Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.  In US it was approximately 5 governmental agencies and the President.  The President orders all businesses with over 100 people to force the vaccine on their workers.  Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy businesses.  The businesses that were trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John**5:19**.*  Amazing how all these things came a long as Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 is being exposed.  *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, just before this pandemic. Donald J. trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.(so called man of justice)* There was rioting and protests all across Europe just before the pandemic.  *Italy, the seat of Rome was the first place to long term lock down, fill their Churches with dead bodies and the first to enforce the covid vaccine pass.  The Pope had a meeting with mayors and governors from around the world under the guise of environmentalism pre-covid.*  
 Read Exodus20, Deuteronomy5 and Acts15 and see about the Bible's view of idols, and you will see that it is Rev/Apoc17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 has caused people to break God's law by using the beast's money.  *Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John**5:19** OWO.  People calling it the NWO, should think, isn't this the same as the genocide and war of WW2?*  Think! 
*Trump authorized operation warp speed to force a vaccination on Americans, but Trump took so called regeneron to recover from covid and didn't isolate when Trump and his campaign manger had covid and the manager was arrested.  Trump either faked him and his campaign manger getting covid, to hide his arrest, or America is being forced to take vaccine, when regeneron can cure with out isolation.  Either way, he is corrupt.   Alex Jones was willing to go to civil war in America and called for mass killing to have Trump be President.  Alex says the vaccines are killing people, but was willing to kill millions to install Donald J. Trump who authorized the forced vaccination.  Alex is corrupt too.*  Quit sabotaging and boycotting yourself in to poverty, remember your history 1776.  *Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?!*  This is the Pope/UK Prince Charles war on business.  *All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.*  There is two realities playing out.  *1. A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  2. Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  Reality 1 is for public consumption, where as reality 2 is for Church and State.(John McAfee, the computer anti virus software owner was put to death(in Spain) to hide this.  Read that a few times so you understand!  Think of which reality is really being talked about!*  God be with the people of the world as they unite against the beast system.  *UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia, supposedly for a rodent infestation.  Hitler killed by rat poison.  Hitler was originally cleaning up rodents around businesses, and advanced to humans.  Zyklon B extermination gas is rat poison with the fumant removed.*  Vaccine passports will be used to stop buying and selling, and those who have virus 2 will be put to death.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=993wlZ6XFSs. *English speaking and didn't react as you would expect.*   Don't bow down to what God calls an abomination!  *Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world through force until the birth of the US and the French revolution, which ended the Bible's prophecy of 1260 years of domination by Rome.  People were beheaded for observing the real Sabbath(not (Sun)day).  A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other side had an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads stacked up.  Ste Bartholomew's massacre.*  In the Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and governments to kill steal and enslave.  Plagues and wars come from man, not God.  Nothing in the darkness is from the light.  *Urgent* necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public!  Putting every thing on the line. _ nkmmk"

I always wish I would of told him how much I loved him and all because he died about 2 years later but I just didn’t want to be one of those people to him."

liftrick	"I see how everyone could see this as him reflecting on his life and how hes dieing and thats why hes sad. but i think there is a deeeper meaning. ""I wear this crown on thorns, upon my liars chair."" I think hes reffering to how he was idolized and that went to to his head and he forgot who he actually was inside. Now at the end of his life he remebers everything and all these broken thoughts are people he hurt that have moved on. This he is talking to himself because he could have had everything, but instead he was tricked into believing he was something hes not! ""If I could start again, a million miles away...."""

David Steed	"Encapsulated at the end...nearly drowned in a pitch black sky full of despair...is this glittering single hope:

If I could start again
A million miles away

Brandon B	"2 Corinthians 4
King James Version
4 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;

2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.

3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;

9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

11 For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;

14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."

Darren Kapusi	So many people/bands have done covers and absolutely blown it. But what Mr Cash snd Disturbed have done shows when you get the right people, at the right time, something amazing can happen. When i hear both renditions they go through to my soul.

Family Adventures	"This song really resonated with me after my grandfather passed. Awhile before he died I sat with him for hours and he talked about his life, regrets, mistakes, people he wronged and that he was one mean son of a bitch. 
I prayed with him for som time and when we finished he was overcome with emotions and was crying, the room felt incredibly calm and peaceful. I told him we all loved him and was happy to be his grandson. We sat for awhile then I helped him into bed. That was the last time I was ever with him."

Me Cooper	"The best thing about this cover is that it transferred this song from being relatable to mental health and drug issues into being relatable to age and just genuine humanity as you get older...

It's honestly one of the most beautiful cumulations that has occurred in my time here on earth and I am very grateful for that."

Dr. Faisel	25K people with no idea what pain sounds like.
Michał Kowalewski	WOW !!!
Remmik	"Cash said in an interview that he was very emotional when filming this video and you can feel it. He didn’t say much more but you can see this was not just acting but a true performance brought forth from his dark side. Even June seems to be emotional, seeing and hearing him do this song. Seeing her in the background and then a quick up close really added to this video. 
  Knowing that she died within a year of filming this, and Cash a few months after her, really makes it a more touching video near the end of a great life and career full of good and troubled times. 
 Not related to this video but June’s daughter also died in 2003 at the age of 45 from carbon monoxide poisoning on her own tour bus. She was barrier along side both of them."
ramon NAVARRO	Song changed my life!!
Panderjit SinghVV	Seems the longer you live the more the dead pile up around you.  If you’re lucky... I guess.
James Stewart	Such a sad song and Johnny Cash being so frail  due to his health problems, just makes it that much more powerful.
Mikey	I finally found this song. Been looking for a new while
kwc	They found away to make money on your death. And you let it happen. An abusive asshole to the end.
Bob Malloy	The first time I ever heard and saw this, a new roommate at my buddy’s house popped this vhs in. It was great..pretty powerful then as kids and now as adults .. cough lol
Halel Eliyah	Most of those who go away suck anyways J.c
Adam Kreuz	I remember hearing this at a record store and freaking out that Cash covered NIN then seeing this video right before Roseanne passed and how he made this his own. This was a perfect exit for Johnny
PolarBearGaming 123	If you know if know that old familiar sting
Carrie Cree	When I see how many legendary men have loved their wives it makes my spirit cry for the loss when death separated them.

SouthernNathaniel	"Listen to this when I'm at my lowest  rn my papa is dieing. He's got about 5 days left. I had wanted to do so much with him. I'm 13 he's in his 57 I think. I had plans out there to do with him. He was diagnosed with colon cancer years ago. Stage 4 now he's fixing to get that achievement. ""Afterlife"" I wanted to go fishing,hunting,shooting, and alot more. After he passes the family will split up and we will never see each other again. Can't wait for when I hit the finish line to meet him and hug him."
Paul Fulton	Listen to it Proper
The Nico Dem	"Is it a bad idea listening to this masterpiece just when my 5 yrs gf cheated on me ?

Stephan G.	The cool thing is that Trent has written this as a young guy realising the shit he is in... but also aging people like the version of Cash with his old weaker/broken voice (weaker than when he was young).
Stephan G.	One of the best covers ever made
Stretch Lindsay	I dis like Johnny Cash's songs bar one I fell in love with (Boy named Sue) hearing this, NO ONE KNOWS UNLIKE JOHNNY AND TRENT the meaning of this song. I Believe it is the memory of the time they spent here (on this earth) and that is MEMORABLE TO SAY THE LEAST! RIP J.C.

ToobxSox	after hearing the original this just doesn't sound the same. i get what its trying to convey but i feel its a disservice to the true message of the song
Cesar Sênior	Outch......this is a punch wowwwwwwwww

Thomson Carter	Wow.  Moving.
NachoBroRyan	Never cared for this song when I bought The Downward Spiral and didn't really see what the big deal was with this version either until I saw the video. The video makes the whole thing, especially knowing he was dead a year later.

GG Allin Tribute	He did not age well. Johnny Cash really got ugly in his old days
Truth Drone	Wow just wow
Steven Winter	Jonny made a choice early on in his life, believing that all he desired was money, fame, power. After being given every material possession that he could imagine, adulation from society, and control over many, Jonny realized that it meant nothing. I am surprised that he was allowed to give this warning to the people. This life is short compared to ETERNITY in the lake of fire, read the BIBLE and understand truly what Jonny was trying to warn you about.
Aimee' Myers	Let's take a moment for this legend.
Jeff Christian	Going through a divorce, lost everything including my kids, homeless on the streets, and I tried to end it all. I’ve done a lot of bad things in my life, and the guilt is heavy. But nothing is worth your own life. So listen to these amazing words and take it in, don’t pull that trigger, don’t take that pill, don’t shoot up. Look forward and keep your head up!!!

Michael Hughes	0:09
S Konstas	Difficult to watch.
Eyesight Journalism	Johnny Cash shows the pain and tribulation of a man. In the end of that man's days, all he has left are materials of contemplation knowing he can't always have his empire alone. For above is transcendence to face alone.

Jeffery K	"Didn’t Trent Reznor say when he heard Johnny sing the cover for the first time, that it was no longer his song anymore?  

Also, I thought Cash didn’t take any copyright for this cover as well? Out of respect to Trent?? Or was that wrong?"
Andrew Humphreys II 777	Muscke rexlaxer 100mg Norflex paxcel tramadole
michael glucksman	Amazing that Johnny allowed himself  to be so vulnerable...probably the single greatest music video of all time
Joseph Beaty	The only musician that can put that much emotion and feeling into the songs. God bless Johnny Cash. Even at his last performance in 2003 he could still make you feel the song. There will never be anyone that can fill his shoes.
Charles Segovia	Yes I did by losing my brother may he rest in peace as God please help us out here in the streets please.and you can have it all my empire of dirt

pete robbo	9 inch nails created it. Cash took it to himself. It was his life story. It's been played at one funeral I've been to so far.
Robert Richard	the amount of symbolism in this one video is something to behold , art personified. The only shameful aspect is it took  Johnny and this video for many to realize the amazing and Iconic song writing skills of the author Trent Reznor
morghoul mutilera	there are so many Johns in present past and in future ...but this one ...just nailed it
hbgriss	Both Nine inch and Cash. What a fking song! 🤘🏼💪🏼♥️🥺

DrFrankenskippy	... absolutely love this cover ...  not an easy song to cover either but alas shows a sense of how much JC had potentially lived the life depicted in the song regards to attitude and life experience
Pygmalion Aprilis	This is Johnny coming in terms with his own death, while the original is Trent coming in terms with his addiction. Both hold a spot in art history.
Андрей Ретинский	🔥🔥🔥

I know I will never forget the how I’ve just felt listening to that song that will be a memory for the rest of my lifetime thank you Mr cash ❤️🤟
Ethan Korewha	"I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything

What have I become? My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time, the feelings disappear
You are someone else, I'm still right here

What have I become? My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down, I will make you hurt
If I could start again a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way"

 I try to forget it , but never succeed.
people are not nice my parents were not nice, nothing but pain, I can identify with this man, I have nothing but empathy for him. At my age now it really is time to forget the world and be just me. My motorbike will be my coffin I will not return from my last ride."

joe mom	i love both versions    saw nin sing it when it came out both in a difernt way emotional what people dont relize  is in the music world  your only as big as what you did lately
Matthew Dingman	This is the song that ran through my head when I finished The Dark Tower series by Stephen King.
johner	Music is all I have left. I’ve drifted away from all social connections I ever had. I’ve alienated my own family. I’m a pariah. I have no hobbies to turn to. No worthwhile interests. I have no savior. All I have left is what I can take in through music, because it’s the only thing that I can truly find an answer in. I don’t even play any fucking instruments - God only knows I’m too much of a failure to even try. It’s the final defense against my own end. I probably would have taken my own life if by now it weren’t for music. It’s the only trace of my soul still left.
melanie muxlow	This song digs right into my soul and opens up every ounce of emotion held within. Truly raw the way Johnny delivers it, no one could give so much into this amazing song as much a he has. You can just see that hes not only singing this but lived and felt every word

los 301	Rest in peace #3 Saquan, 17 years old. Stabbed to death leaving school yesterday. You were on your way to a state championship for football on the varsity team.

Zigge Hed	As every year pass, I feel this song cutting deeper and deeper.
Charles C	Please talk to someone, if you need to.
J Martin	I can't help but feel a bit confused by some of these comments. The song is about heroin addiction, this song was originally written by Trent Reznor. The story goes that Cash had anxiety on the set and Elvis Presley told him that pills help to ease that. The rest is history I guess.

Super Day Day	His life was up and down and in the end he brought out this song that showed him in the past tense and today before he passed it was one of his best works, his son sings this song just as powerful as his dad, and this man Johnny Cash was one of a kind, RIP Mr. Johnny Cash, you and your talented wife will be missed and thought about.
Raoul Pinkett	very powerful very sad
Thrath Jacobs	Mr. Cash, you'll never be forgotten, I always find my way back to this song that speaks to my soul.
Horse Enthusiast	This is seriously one of the best covers in music history, in my opinion. Cash and Reznor are both fantastic artists in their own rights, but something about the way Cash sings this makes it transcend the original to such an epic, raw, real low. It's absolutely beautiful.
Heath Sands	This is amazing and hair raising on many levels…raw and real…I loved NIN…and Cash…this was the most extraordinary interpretation ever
Accidental Life	This song kills me. I lost my brain a while ago.. talk about losing yourself. 3 years ago at 34 I became a fucking epileptic, The 1st medicine they put me on I couldn't even tell you my own name for the month I was on it. Now I cannot drive or work and seize at least 5 a month.

AlexSnow5	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

The Lovely Sheri	*Johnny Cash made an obituary for himself*
Tim Davies	None of us know how long we have on this planet. The older we get the more we accept that the sand is rapidly running out of egg timer. I think Johnny knew this. What a brilliant song.
pulcinoide	Un capolavoro che tocca il cuore...
Carl Gantz	"This Song is So Powerful.  
Anyone who has struggled with anything in their life (Life and Death) can see and feel the Man in Black's Soul through this song"
spaaggetii Man	Such a beautiful song, reminds me of how we gather and buy something we cherish like a house or even the little additions like a garden gnome etc.. Then we lose a sister, friend or mother or father and it really means little. A pile of dirt compared to our love for those that have passed on to greater things. Take care everyone, and remember to tell those close to you that you love them. Sorry this song brings me to tears every time I listen to it.
RJ Murray	Vet here, when Johnny passed, a part of America passed with him, we have all been hurting ever since.
Jeffrey Renner	R.I.P. Johnny
Broken Spades	this song is goated👏👏
Mini Me2	The man has so much pain in his voice. You can see the tears he's holding back. Hits me every time and yet I come back just to feel the pain
Ichi Zatoichi	Only one word comes to mind...Legend
evulmievl	"My friends grandmother told me how whem she was young she and her friends would have get togethers where they would play cards. She told me ""you might of heard of my one friend johnny who would come over"". ""He went on to become quite well known"". 😳😳"
Andreas Christo	I lost my Dad this year, this song really helped me feel what I needed to.  I'm still in pain, but I feel he's with me when I play my guitar and this song.
seal in french	I remember listening to this song when I was around 10 years old. I was showing my dad sad music i had found on YouTube. “ you want to hear something that’s sad and real, I’ll show you this”. I listened to it over and over, it still has the impact it did when it was first shown to me.
Glenn Hall	"Best song I've ever heard. This is the song of a broken man whose beloved wife died after a life time of both Johnny and her seeking God. All he has left is remorse is for his own failures and faith toward the One that will even make those failures right. He and his wife have become one and they will see each other and co-exist as each other again.  For our Creator said that ""the two shall become one."""
ebaecity	this song still puts tears in my eyes

Selman genç 	"Lyrics :

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel

The needle tears a hole

But I remember everything

My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt

Royce Skepagny	What the current generation doesn’t have in musical genius. Feel bad for them not having “The Man in Black”. Gone far too soon, at 71. The age I am, now.
Stoopid Pursun	The only reason this isn't the greatest swan song in history is because The Show Must Go On exists. But a very close second to Freddie Mercury is a good spot to be.
LinkinParkRulz 227	My younger brother committed suicide last weekend by overdosing on something. He was found with headphones on, presumably listening to something. This is his youtube account. He made a playlist containing 6 songs that was edited the day he passed. This is one of the 6 songs. With the method he used, he was dead after about 30 minutes, probably unconscious around 12 minutes. I like to think that it was peaceful for him with his music on. I love you Darius, I'll miss you everyday for the rest of my life.
Larry Lehmann	I weep every time!
Mark Johnson	Great Song and how that represents everything and everyone in his life.  I want that song along with Amazing Grace and It is Well with My Soul to be given at my funeral.

Aaron Runk	I physical hurt myself today. Took a razor blade to my face. So broken at this point of my life. I need to learn to forgive myself from my past. One day at a time. Hitting rock bottom hurts but im going up from here. No need to repeat this self destructive pattern.
RED FOX	What a miserable life
Flyinggoatz canfly	masons didnt catch him, he was strong
John Hadley	I played this song on Loop at least 500 times in the month after my ex left me and now six years later I don't feel like it applies to me anymore. I'm proud of myself for getting the right things done in order to become the guy I am today and keep the promises I made to myself

Anders Johansson	Best!
Random Guy	"I have told my boy a million times, feel nothing.  Take those emotions and press them down so the world can not see what you are feeling.  Control yourself and you can control the world around you.    
This track will reach into your guts, grabs a hold of those feelings and twist until you buckle.......  I cant explain it but this transcends human emotion."
Jerry Money	Wow life is tragic like this 🖤🖤...brilliant sad song
ich sehe	я не вернусь обратно.
Gary Slater	"I defy anyone to listen to this with dry eyes.
A sick old man, who knows he doesn't have long to live, looks back on his life and finds nothing but guilt and regret. Regret not just for his wrongdoings and shortcomings, but also for the pain they caused his loved ones. He knows his fame and wealth cannot right those wrongs, or extend his life by a single second - they amount to nothing, an ""empire of dirt"".
In the final verse, my feeling is that he wishes he could have his time again, and would live it very differently, if he could.
An emotionally devastating performance - utterly heartbreaking !"
loren wiener	intense
Peter Choffy	Incredible... I had shivers watching this video
Athletic Geek	LEGEND
Alain Le Barang	Cette chansons fait Mal,
Randy Holder	WOW every time I hear this song it gets deeper, at the end after he closes the lid on the piano I just heard static in my brain, white noise.
R$E	Sad how no one in the comments appears to see Johnny Cash was making this song about the regret over his past sins, how they drove the nails into the hands of Christ, and how his faith in Jesus is his hope beyond the grave.
Kenneth WIlliams	viva la rasa!

daz sam	This song is so hard hitting, you can tell how perfect this song is by looking at the comments on here and seeing how this song has taken a hold of people lives in so many different ways, and has so many meanings and feelings to so many people that must be the meaning of a perfect song when you look at your own life and question WHAT HAVE I BECOME, thank you for this song.

SteakOG	"I went through 4 head injuries in a matter of 6 months, The last one I caused myself out of 'hurt' whilst sitting in the back of a cop car and not having fully recovered from the first 3 I very violently and repeatedly smashed my head into the cop seat. In a matter of moment my brain stung and I instantly lost processing speed. 
I have not recovered and now live a life of knowing what I did to myself. This song sums up how I feel."

John Galt	One of my favorite episodes of Little House on the Prairie was John posing as a Priest to bring home donations to his wife.

zep stamp	when the cover is performed better than the original
Seamus Kelly	Sad but brilliant, really 'tears a hole' in your soul at the end as it speeds up and the speed of the images/video adds to the feeling and drama. His thumbs up at 3:16 is class.  Masterful from a Master.

Lewis Robins	"I liked when Johnny sang ""you can have it all my empire of dirt"" and the video shows a collection of his awards. The message I got from this is Johnny is saying he would give anything to be young again and start over. His awards and fame were meaningless and as he was nearing death. Wonderful video and song."

My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all

I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

We had to cut ties with that side of the family for years, but    in the year before he died I my mother and I were able to pick back up our relationship with him. On my birthday we were supposed to go see a movie with him, but he was late and we couldn't. Later that day he called me telling me he had a present for me, and to call him back. I never did. I wish I could have had just one more day with him.

Seth Newman	2 weeks ago my girlfriend of 4 years left me. In 4 years things moved fast, we had 2 kids and even moved into a giant house that was ours.(rent to own) she left me for my “best friend” because she feels as though I don’t make enough time for her and the kids. I’ve never been that great of a man or dad, but she always told me and gave me notes that said she loved me and thought I was amazing. How does it all amount to this pile of dirt, and crown of thorns.

Jaroslava Vondřichová	Promítání života je opravdu hodně krásné
Coop	Clearly an attempt at closure for him with the hope that June was listening.  He wanted one thing…..to see her again and was terrified, as anyone would be when you know you’re near the end.  That cover was heartbreaking in many ways.  He was singing that for himself and June with clear pain in his eyes.  She was the only thing he wanted….and I hope they’re together and at peace.  We could all learn something about that type of love

Those who miss you will get old and pass in silence. You can see the world going forward without you. Your feet are rooted to the ground and your hands turns into dust. It's time to let loose. Good bye for the last time. I'm happy you read this, the pain you feel still keeps you here, yet the blessed numbness comes.

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Michelle Walters	Thank you so much Johnny Cash the legend you are leaving such a beautiful piece for your closing thought it gives me chills every time. I understand your struggle with addiction perhaps you understand mine with walking the same walk of Darkness. Not to mention mental illness dually diagnosed. I saw someone write on one of the comments that the closing piano piece was like closing the coffin and boy that gave me the chills too because that is so beautifully said. I sure in the hell wish I could start again A Million Miles Away. Keep myself and find a way. You can't put it in any other genius better words than that. Or perhaps I did get to start again. With my second-born child and a chance to be a mother. Anyone who is struggling with addiction can reach out to me I just Embrace sobriety and want to give back what was so freely and lovingly given to me. I don't compare I relate and definitely don't judge a single soul. This song got me through some of the darkest moments in my life. And Johnny Cash thank you for being part of my sobriety with your talent and compassion. Much love, peace and light, GODZ KID

lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Emergency, the story behind the virus.* There is a mass genocide going on.  *Police state being set up world wide to enforce subjection to Church and State.* The virus has a two week incubation period.  After two weeks isolated you are good to go according to prior information. *There was 12000000 exterminated by Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2.* Why did the so called British Royal who just died take the last name of the so called Queen?  To try to further the fraud that the British are the continuation of the Biblical line of King David.  *That is one of the reasons WW2 started.*  To distract you from the fraud.  *Women inherit men's last names, not the other way around.  Philip was a German, then he became a Greek citizen and then a British Royal.  He wasn't even a British citizen. (Search Queen Elizabeth wedding!)*  People don't realize that Britain is part of the Roman Empire. *Prince Charles was just hugging the Pope recently, and congratulating him on his war.  The head of England is supposedly God's representative and defender of the faith.  So Charles hugging the Pope, is like God's representative hugging Satan's.*  Just like Hitler started a war with Russia, so they are trying to start a war with Russia and China now.  *The Pope is (King) in control of the Roman Empire mentioned in Revelation Apocalypse 17, 18 of the Bible.   He is the King of the Vatican City/ Country.  He has his own crown and flag.  On his crown is the number 666 in Latin (a picture of the triple tiered crown(also referred to as a mitre) with 666 on it, is on the Pope's flag).  The Bible mentions (Rev/Apoc17,18) that the leaders of Rome's group would be clothed in scarlet (Catholic Cardinals) and purple (Catholic Bishops).  This group would be responsible for all the people exterminated from the earth.*  It was the Catholic Adolf Hitler who exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, so that the British side of the Roman Empire would not fall, as they had no legal heir. They imported one from Germany, but needed the war to kill lots of people that knew of the fraud and to create a smoke screen.  *The Pope rules from his compound in the Vatican, Rome Italy. The Swiss guard directly guard the Vatican compound.* The Italian army also protects the Pope, but all the nations of the Roman Empire have a covenant to protect him.  That it is why there is a coming vaccine passport in all these Countries. *This religion/ Empire siphons the money from the people's of the world to them.  Like the Bible prophecy of Revelation Apocalypse 17, 18 mentions that the great city riding the Roman Empire is clothed in all kinds of precious stones.  In fact a Roman Emperor bragged that when he found Rome it was clothed in brick, but when he was finished it was clothed in marble.*  Magna Carta proves that Britain is part of the Roman Empire. *The Magna Carta treaty deals with when people rebel against the Roman Empire.  It talks about how a nation and its overlords will be reimbursed for warring against their own people.  It dictates that the people should be locked down, and then they will go in and slaughter them.*  Britain pretended to have separated from Rome, on account of it being satanic, and the *Pope having 666 (Vicarious Filii Dei, in Latin)* on his crown, fake Sabbath etc...  People were duped in to thinking the British way was the truth.  Social media sharing sites are under attack, because 2Corinthians4:4 is trying to stop Daniel2:44,45,12:4.   *During WW2 a Catholic Adolf Hitler killed 12000000 people under the guise of a fake typhus epidemic.  Typhus still exists, but no where is it handled, like that time.  Now we have the so called corona virus pandemic, where nearly 98% make a complete recovery.  They are instituting extreme measures, just like for the typhus epidemic.  In Canada, Australia they are putting people in temporary concentration camps.* They are controlled by the British Empire.  Canada's constitution guarantees Quebec's Roman Catholic faith, so that the Country can always be divided and conquered.  If Canadians try to stop Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, then they will call it treason, for going against the Canadian constitution and kill them.  *Roman Catholic, as in the Church of Revelation Apocalypse 17, 18 that rides the Roman Empire.  At the end of the world as we know it now, the Roman empire will have 10 Kingdoms.  The Kingdom's are, or have been France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Spain, Portugal, Turkey(former headquarters of the Roman Empire, Constantinople (now Istanbul), and others, and the places they conquered.  Like Canada being set up for perpetual enslavement, so other places are also, like India is completely controlled by Britain.  Canada, Australia, India and others are Constitutional Monarchies, in which the Queen is the supreme ruler. Who's head is on your money?*  Many nations live in poverty while Rome and Britain siphons off your money and natural resources, India a prime example.  *The Bible said that the Roman Empire would split in to two, and from this two, there would be ten Kingdoms at the end.  Five Kingdom's from each leg.*  Like Hitler looted burned and exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic, so now they are looting, burning and exterminating under the guise of a corona virus, and the vaccines come from the place that orchestrated the first concentration camp genocides (Germany, or those German descended).  *Corona means crown or rulership (government).  A corona virus is some thing attacking the crown, rulership(government).*  In Britain, Canada Australia and others the justice system represents the British Crown. 
 *Some day the world's people will have to unite, to end this reign of terror.  To use a poker term, we need a Royal Flush.  (Important)Clear YouTube search and history, and browser cache and history, so they don't know you read this.  Hide copies, share, distribute them,   Be very careful!  Pray for me and you!*  Zyklon B extermination gas = corona virus?  *Hitler used zyklon b, or automobile exhaust gas blown in your window also.  Why would planes be spraying of your cities? Government sprays cities, corona virus occurs. If you have a hard time breathing from that, they will finish you off at the hospital.  Nurses blew the whistle on that.*  Why would the military be giving the vaccines?  *Military personnel have to start taking a stand.  Do you want God and history to condemn you?*  The Bible says that two legs come out of the Roman Empire, which would be Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.  *The Bible says that they would put you to death, if you did not worship the image.  The image is the cross, and it symbolizes the religious beliefs.  Canada moving towards a forced symbol of acceptance of Church and State, or no work or travel?  If you don't have the sign of the cross you can not buy or sell.  Look at Hong Kong where they were allowed to sell on international markets under the control of Britain, but when the lease ended and Britain left, they have started a war of words, political intrigue and are trying to start a physical war to stop them from selling. Christain Countries are trying to start a war with China and Russia, to hide their genocide.* They also radiate. *Donald J. Trump and about 5 US government agencies, authorized operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American population, (not Bill Gates).*  Spanish plague(1918) vaccine was for bacterial infection, but the plague was a virus.  Most Christian Countries were forbidden to report on the plague, hidding its details under war powers.  *The Pope and British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, just before corona virus outbreak.  Donald J Trump attacked the International Court via US financial system.*  A man of integrity? Virus=information.  *The first Pope(263) to try to expose the world wide conspiracy, died 6 days later.  Please help me(266) to expose this (1John**5:19**)!* 
 The Bible's 1Corinthians9:5, MARK1:30 expose a massive worldwide conspiracy.  *Australia has a police state, including militarized checkpoints and home and media searches.*  Massive poison purchase and UK contracting cadaver services.  *666 was the original number of the beast but Greek and Latin changed the Hebrew Samekh which has a value of 60 to Xi(X) which has a value of 10, to hide the 666 identity by appearing as 616.  Ancient amulets had numbers for every god, but the so called main god symbolised by the sun, had a value of all numbers in the 6x6 amulet added, which = 666.  So the Monstrance(sun icon) of the Church = 666.  And the the Pope's crown has 666.*  2 realities:  *1 is a biological virus that is infecting people, and a vaccine for it.  2 is information exposing fraudulent Government and religion, and is the real virus, and computer anti virus software to stop the information.  It is referred to as a corona virus because it attacks(exposes) the crown(government).*  (Sun)day is not the Sabbath of the Bible, but a Roman made day, honoring the sun not God. *Remember that the sun's number is 666, representing the chief god. Ask a priest what day the Sabbath is!*  Ezekiel 20:20. Isaiah 66:23 *Catechism of the Catholic Church says that you can not buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross (Church)*  Australia has concentration camps.  666 on every Roman derived barcode on products.  Military id is an implanted microchip.  These chips will soon hold health info"". Vaccine passport?    *Who is blocking North American AM radio communications?* https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WSlW8l7UvuI. Lockdowns, and vaccine passes come from governments, not Bill Gates, as Bill Gates does not control governments.  Donald J Trump and about 5 US government organizations including DOD started operation warp speed to force vaccine Americans and Joe Biden has continued that.  Governments world wide have tried to get people to boycott and attack business, as if they did it. ;((+?("

I had to learn my history from the internet, he gave my the keywords to search once the internet came to be.

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

The Horror Genre	So I would go to a kids hospital to play the guitar for the cancer kids and every Wednesday I would go and play and everyone would just sit and clap along or hum the tune. Except one kid, he would sit in the back. His name was adain. The next week or so and I get a call from adains parents and he wanted to see me, and it was getting late to. So I went and he asked me to play twinkle twinkle little star and half way through the song he asked me to give him a hug and during that hug adain passed away. I’ll never forget what he said to me  “thank you “ was all he said as he passed away

IamThe 13thFloor	I swam in shit today.. just to sea what you would say.. so you'll go away before I'm to old to play.. I pray for drunk not to cum and can safely stay.. seems nothing can buy a safe pile of dirt.. as they cart my shit away... I was born with inner crowns of thrones from accoustics wars.. that stab me everyday and way, I'm unable to become as the rib kills me.. while they have it all screaming and laughing at my fall as tears grow my falling cells into eyelids and prices walk away.  I have nothing to say as my white blood spills everyday leaving stains of smell as they ask was she even real as they stomp on me as there grass til they fire up my ass for crystal meth after the plunge to death as soldiers follow me year after year I'll take that bag of flesh pretend I'm not here.... Waiting to see if I'll serve them beer so they don't have to run to catch my ass... Naming me anyone.. sold from those I held dear before becoming the foe. NOONE knows.

Marion Wilson	Diabeties and things Manu musicians have written about. The faith shouldn't always judge they are warned about doing. Does not represent everyone in their judgements as so many are so wrong.

Сергей Беляков	Reznor wrote this song for Cash, without knowing it
sondra milam	what is the story behind this song Almost a year before his death at the age of 70, Johnny Cash would gain a younger generation of fans by covering a Nine Inch Nails song from 1994 entitled “Hurt”. The question of how did he end up covering that specific song is bound to be asked? It seemed like a strange choice at the time while also being very appropriate given his stage life.
Ed Stone	i haaate country, but this one hits different

I Do It For Me	Who says a remake can't be better than the original? This song was written for him. I can't hear it, know his story, know at what point in his life he sang this, and not get choked up. Johnny Cash suffered, and was brilliant.
zachary939	Trent wrote this for John.  He just didn’t realize it at the time.

Native 99	His voice got better with age!!!!
thenson1halo	We, of the world, mourn woefully the passing of Johnny Cash.  But he was ready to go and rejoin his beloved June.  She was his life and that short period after she was gone and Johnny remained was just a little parting gift to us.  This was his goodbye.  Even Trent himself said it.... this is no longer a Nine Inch Nails song.  This song is Johnny's.
YetiAdventures	Such horrible lyrics. What is his statement?

What, is ""Li'ljizzbuckkketFugBag"" going to cover ""XXXTentation"" in a way that can possibly mean anything to anyone? Meaning has been not just lost, but discarded. In the name of the As Holy as Useless Vax -- People today suck noise where once there was culture and fruition and truth and beauty and loss and sublimity. Now, it's just about trying to be as much as possible like a surviving sex robot. Pfizer will not let you down. Moderna will never make you hurt. According to their PR."
lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Emergency, the story behind the virus.* There is a mass genocide going on.  *Police state being set up world wide to enforce subjection to Church and State.* The virus has a two week incubation period.  *After two weeks isolated you are good to go according to prior information.* There was 12000000 exterminated by Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2. *Why did the so called British Royal who just died take the last name of the so called Queen?  To try to further the fraud that the British are the continuation of the Biblical line of King David.  That is one of the reasons WW2 started.  To distract you from the fraud.  Women inherit men's last names, not the other way around.  Philip was a German, then he became a Greek citizen and then a British Royal.  He wasn't even a British citizen. (Search Queen Elizabeth wedding!)*  People don't realize that Britain is part of the Roman Empire. *Prince Charles was just hugging the Pope recently, and congratulating him on his war.  The head of England is supposedly God's representative and defender of the faith.  So Charles hugging the Pope, is like God's representative hugging Satan's.*  Just like Hitler started a war with Russia, so they are trying to start a war with Russia and China now.  *As the Pope is (King) in control of the Roman Empire mentioned in Revelation Apocalypse 17, 18 of the Bible.   He is the King of the Vatican City/ Country.  He has his own crown and flag.  On his crown is the number 666 in Latin (a picture of the triple tiered crown(also referred to as a mitre) with 666 on it, is on the Pope's flag).*  The Bible mentions (Rev/Apoc17,18) that the leaders of Rome's group would be clothed in *scarlet (Catholic Cardinals)* and *purple (Catholic Bishops).*  This group would be responsible for all the people exterminated from the earth.  *It was the Catholic Adolf Hitler who exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, so that the British side of the Roman Empire would not fall, as they had no legal heir. They imported one from Germany, but needed the war to kill lots of people that knew of the fraud and to create a smoke screen.*  The Pope rules from his compound in the Vatican, Rome Italy. The Swiss guard directly guard the Vatican compound. The Italian army also protects the Pope, but all the nations of the Roman Empire have a covenant to protect him.  That it is why there is a coming vaccine passport in all these Countries. *This religion/ Empire siphons the money from the people's of the world to them.  Like the Bible prophecy of Revelation Apocalypse 17, 18 mentions that the great city riding the Roman Empire is clothed in all kinds of precious stones. In fact a Roman Emperor bragged that when he found Rome it was clothed in brick, but when he was finished it was clothed in marble.*  Magna Carta proves that Britain is part of the Roman Empire. *The Magna Carta treaty deals with when people rebel against the Roman Empire.  It talks about how a nation and its overlords will be reimbursed for warring against their own people.  It dictates that the people should be locked down, and then they will go in and slaughter them.*  Britain pretended to have separated from Rome, on account of it being satanic, and the *Pope having 666 (Vicarious Filii Dei, in Latin) on his crown, fake Sabbath etc..*  People were duped in to thinking the British way was the truth.  Social media sharing sites are under attack, because the oppressors want to silence information about it.  *During WW2 a Catholic Adolf Hitler killed 12000000 people under the guise of a fake typhus epidemic.  Typhus still exists, but no where is it handled, like that time.  Now we have the so called corona virus pandemic, where nearly 98% make a complete recovery.  They are instituting extreme measures, just like for the typhus epidemic.  In Canada, Australia they are putting people in temporary concentration camps.* They are controlled by the British Empire.  Rome and Britain put a French colony right in the middle of an English Country, and put in to Canada's constitution that the French would be guaranteed their Catholic faith.  If Canadians try to stop this fake Church/ Empire, then they will call it treason, for going against the Canadian constitution and kill them.  *Roman Catholic, as in the Church of Revelation Apocalypse 17, 18 that rides the Roman Empire.*  At the end of the world as we know it now, the Roman empire will have 10 Kingdoms.  The Kingdom's are, or have been France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Spain, Portugal, Turkey(former headquarters of the Roman Empire, Constantinople (now Istanbul), and others, and the places they conquered.  Like Canada being set up for perpetual enslavement, so other places are also, like India is completely controlled by Britain.  *Canada, Australia, India and others are Constitutional Monarchies, in which the Queen is the supreme ruler.* Who's head is on your money? *Many nations live in poverty while Rome and Britain siphons off your money and natural resources, India a prime example.*  The Bible said that the Roman Empire would split in to two, and from this two, there would be ten Kingdoms at the end.  Five Kingdom's from each leg.  *Like Hitler looted burned and exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic, so now they are looting, burning and exterminating under the guise of a corona virus,* and the vaccines come from the place that orchestrated the first concentration camp genocides (Germany, or those German descended).  *Corona means crown or rulership (government).  A corona virus is some thing attacking the crown, rulership(government).*  In Britain, Canada Australia and others the justice system represents the British Crown. *Some day the world's people will have to unite, to end this reign of terror.  To use a poker term, we need a Royal Flush.  Clear YouTube search and history, and browser cache and history, so they don't know you read this.  Hide copies, share, distribute them,   Be very careful!  Pray for me and you!*  Zyklon B extermination gas = corona virus?  Hitler used zyklon b, or automobile exhaust gas blown in your window also.  *Why would planes be spraying of your cities? Government sprays cities, corona virus occurs. If you have a hard time breathing from that, they will finish you off at the hospital.  Nurses blew the whistle on that.  Why would the military be giving the vaccines?  Military personnel have to start taking a stand.  Do you want God and history to condemn you?*  The Bible says that two legs come out of the Roman Empire, which would be Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.  The Bible says that they would put you to death, if you did not worship the image.  *The image is the cross, and it symbolizes the religious beliefs.  Canada moving towards a forced symbol of acceptance of Church and State, or no work or travel?  If you don't have the sign of the cross you can not buy or sell.*  Look at Hong Kong where they were allowed to sell on international markets under the control of Britain, but when the lease ended and Britain left, they have started a war of words, political intrigue and are trying to start a physical war to stop them from selling. Christain Countries are trying to start a war with China and Russia, to hide their genocide. They also radiate. *Donald J. Trump had authorized operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American population, not Bill Gates.*  Spanish plague(1918) vaccine was for bacterial infection, but the plague was a virus.  Most Christian Countries were forbidden to report on the plague, hidding its details under war powers.  *The Pope and British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, just before corona virus outbreak.  Donald J Trump attacked the International Court via US financial system.*  Multiple mass graves of exterminated found on multiple Church run properties across Canada, so Natives burned down the Churches, effectively saying we don't want this abomination on our land.  Rev. 17,18 Rome and false church riding it, kills.  Virus=information.  *The first Pope(263) to try to expose the world wide conspiracy, died 6 days later.  Please help me(266) to expose this (1John**5:19**)!*  A red headed bird was going to reveal all, but evil men seam to have caged him.  *Any one able to should break the story!*  The *Bible's 1Corinthians9:5, MARK1:30 expose a massive worldwide conspiracy.*  Australia has a police state, including militarized checkpoints and home searches.

Ralf	Auch eines der größten und gefühlsbetontesten Titel mit wunderbarer Melodie . Musikalisch so schön umgesetzt. Danke Johnny Cash.
Michael H	"The contrast between adoration and loving abundance in his relationship (looking at the picture on the wall of his deceased love) as he contemplates the brief moment of existence we get to experience and the pain and superficial, transient nature of his ""empire of dirt"" is so powerful and emotionally raw it draws you into Mr. Cash's aura of pain and despair yet contentment with a life well lived. Top five songs of all time in dealing with the human condition."

Ameliorator777	I started drinking when I was 16. I would drink at parties, but I also started drinking alone because I was unhappy, and I was in a lot of emotional pain all the time. My mom was very aggressive when I was younger, and my brother hated her and so did I. He started hanging out with shady people, he started failing all his classes, he was never home, and my parents fought all the time. I also ran away several times. I was always trying to figure out a reason as to why I was here or what the purpose of life was. So, I started looking at different philosophies, religions, and beliefs. When I was 18 after I was hungover, I got on my knees and I prayed for the first time. I asked if God was real that he would show me he was real because I couldn’t take it anymore. I was crying when I prayed for this. At that moment I felt a presence come over me like a wind. It was barely noticeable, but it was unlike anything in my life I had experienced up until that point. I was surprised when I felt it and I remember saying “what was that?” after that experience I pretty much forgot what happened and kept partying, until my senior year when I got arrested. After my arrest, my parents lost all their trust in me and I was expelled from high school. I was told never to come back. At that time, I felt afraid and hopeless. That’s when I started looking for God, and I prayed that he would reveal himself in my life and that he would give me signs. My prayers began getting answered so consistently that I couldn’t deny that God was doing something. It was mysterious and compelling. I ended up in Church and started reading the bible hours a day. I stopped hanging out with all my other friends because they were continually getting arrested. I was able to forgive my family and myself and to ask to be forgiven. I noticed how at Church people were judgmental and how they formed cliques but were afraid to be around anyone else different from them. It increased my faith because I realized Jesus was not like that and ever since I was young, I saw people as people regardless of who they were. After a while, it’s like I could see God's presence was in my life and then it felt like he wasn’t, and then he was, and then he wasn’t. One day I woke up and felt more depressed than I ever have in my entire life. I felt like I was dying on the inside. That night I prayed, and I said, God, I don’t see my life five years from now I'm going to die Jesus save me Lord, please save me. I was weeping when I said it and when I asked him to save me, I felt a presence inside of me like a heartbeat, and I felt it once like a pulse, and I said Lord please save me and I felt it again even stronger. It was like radiance. When I woke up the next morning, I had transformed everything felt brand new like I was a kid again. All my fears and all my racing thoughts everything was gone. I looked at my hands, and I said this can’t be real, it's impossible. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw a different person. I started praying, and the holy spirit became entirely real to me; it was washing over me and inside of me. It was total love and peace, and I heard a voice but not an audible one, it was an inner voice. It said I am with you; I love you, I will never leave you, it’s done it’s finished. That was May 3rd, 2009, and ever since then I’ve followed God, I have seen many things change and many things I know wouldn’t have changed without faith and belief. I know what it’s like to be lost to feel you have no hope. Don’t ever think you’re stuck, or life can’t change because it can. My mom is a Christian now, Its night and day. Some of the things that went away during that period were severe anxiety and my addiction to alcohol. I’ve seen and experienced so many things that are miraculous and seen how God has worked in my life. When we ask God to forgive us for what we’ve done and turn away from our sins and wrongdoings and we believe in Christ's sacrifice everything changes. His word says if we confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and believe in our hearts that he died and rose again we will have eternal life but not just life after death but abundant life in the present. Our sins are erased not only past, present, and future but our burdens and fears are lifted also. Our thoughts, our minds, our hearts, our souls are transformed and united with God and we know his spirit lives in us. If you seek, pray, and knock you will know JESUS IS KING!!! HE LIVES!

Mantas Juozėnas	Ema Grigaitė, kur esi?
Lucas Barnes	I'm. Gonna cry 😞😭😢😭
Jorge Ramalho	Great music
Robert Scott	The lesson here is that life without Christ is altogether vanity. Clearly their was reflection in this video towards the end of his true hope in Christ Jesus and I hope Johnny was truly saved through faith alone in the God-man Jesus Christ and His death, burial and resurrection.
Felipe	When i saw this video first time, it had 2.1 million views. Glad so much people know that beauty now.

Knee Garz	"I'm a recovering drug addict. Been fighting addiction for 6 years. Lost everything from friends, family, to material possessions, and also, my own self. Still fighting every single day, and fighting to repair all that I've destroyed. 
This song, both Cash's and NIN's versions help me battle this. 
Never give up. 
Never stop fighting. 
There's always light at the end of the tunnel."

ZxxxD	Ghost recon hurt itself today
Pablo Pulisich	"What I like about this version of the song is that it hits differently than many other songs, and the original version.

This is a reminder, to every musician who sings about partying and being young: You will age, the party will be over one day, and you will be left alone if you don't nourish anything around you other than your own ego.

This is a song that makes me feel that in the end, if you don't do things right, before you go, you will turn around to see your life before it ends, and you will find a road of regrets and dissapointments, and that is terrifying."
StrengthTraining84	🙏
J Scho	Such a beautiful piece of art.

Thebrokekidd	hope he meets his brother in a better life rip johnny cash
Trent Lomelino	Will not be a better cover of a song. Music is the strangest thing.
dezz nutz	I still remember when I first saw this video.  I honestly just happened upon it and was curious as a 90s grunge/alt rock fan to see how Cash would cover Trent Reznor's hit.  I also had heard his wife, June Carter had just passed.   I was floored by not only what I heard, but by what I saw as well.   2 months later he was gone.

David J.	Johnny Cash was a legend from the word go. He could take any song, make it his own - and completely reignite a new generation to his sound. Cash had 2 great passions in life - our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; and his mortal love - June Carter Cash. It's sad to think that we will never hear from this talent again in this lifetime.

Daniel Mota	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Doc Will	"I marched in step today, to see how it used to feel, I focus on habits that remain for they are all that is left thats real. 

The pills I swallow whole as my ears start that familiar ring,
Try to forgot those days, but I remember everything. 

What have we all done?
My dearest friends, all the brothers I knew have gone away or departed for an early end. 

And you could have them all, my medals and uniforms are worth less than dirt,
For it was I who let them down the one who was meant to stop their hurt, 

No glory can be found, for they all lied about the reasons we were sent over there.

Head now full of haunting memories which I cannot repair, 

Despite all this time the feelings have never gone away 

Many have managed to move on, here I am cursed to stay 

And you could have them all, my medals and uniforms are worth less than dirt,
For it was I who let them down the one who was meant to stop their hurt, 

If I could turn back time, go back all 3,565 days I could save them myself, I swear this time I would find a way.

An Afghanistan War Corpsman's Hurt.

Stanley Lecznar	I own this CD and purchased it because of this song. I never saw this video and it is powerful! I love the 53 second and 2:28 parts because of the simple repetition of the piano. Thank you to Rick Rubin for supporting this legends return.
Caspar Brock	Just says it best. It...
DJ Kaotic Mix	Wow. Another excellent heart felt version of that song.  God bless you Johnny and Thank You.
Bruno Oliveira do Nascimento	ETERNO LOGAN
Collin Saylor	It’s so beautiful what he created n left behind for people to reflect on
teresa strawn	"Omg this says it
 all for life"
glen cannon	The tear in his eye the whole time during this video is the emotion of knowing that this will be his last production released of a legendary career !!! Cash you are a legend and always will be remembered. the music is timeless and still inspires artists like myself!!!
Susan Lorenz	It’s like he is singing at his own memorial service while gigs is alive..the hours ticking needlessly by…all the B.S of life left behind and raw regret and hurt all that is left
Gianfranco Ghironi	Una canzone semplicemente ... straordinaria. Grandissimo Johnny Cash! :-)
MANCHAKA !	Legend
Daniel Joseph	❤
Penfold0003	I remember seeing this around the time of his death and just being blown away by it. I watch it now and I am again. The song is so powerful but the video is to the point of being overwhelming (in the most complimentary way possible). Hurt is (of course) a cover, but Johnny Cash makes it his totally. And, yes, as others have commented, that piano cover shutting is an image you never forget.
dumars	Reznor, after resistance, admitted that in the end, he created this for Cash to sing.
Caterina D'Angelo	Mito... 🇮🇹
Nathan Burshtein	24k probably deaf people. i feel sorry for you
CRAYZ33T	If this doesn't break you at some point you have no soul.

C-Luv Gaming	Man, this song reminds me of my Papa. He went through so much. Here I am growing up in a world of rap music but when I hear this song... I hear my papa who went through world war 2 and broke AF but started our family. Thank you papa and Johnny Cash!
gerardbaker1	This man is amazing it's hard to watch time take a person, time will end for everyone. Enjoy every day and laugh a lot ...
dmc44	This song just touches my inner soul. LONG-LIVE CASH!!
Holland Kroese	Guess we’ll never get a Johnny Cash cover of “Closer.”
Alex Reid	And as of today given where things are and what we’ve come through these past few years in our own lives personally and collectively…24,000 people dislike this. What have WE become?
Purse Pearl	Saw an article on this in Entertainment Weekly 😢
214 Productions	greatest song ever
Zigtavius	The song is absolutely haunting and the video they put together is an underappreciated masterpiece
TheScrappyCat	That whole last album is just heartbreaking.  Hearing him cover Bridge Over Troubled Water makes me cry, every time.  This one does too.  Brilliant video.
Jazey Haze	"Don't quote me but I'm pretty sure Trent Reznor said something like: 

""As soon as I heard this rendition/cover I realized the song was no longer mine"" What a humble salute to one of the greatest to ever do it!🤘"
Anthony Allsopp	We all love you sir xoxo
ALBARO SANCHEZ	Top ten de canciones que escuche

John Lawrence Sampelo Viloria	I'm here because of Codfish
Chri Lin	Wish I could start again, a mil miles away or at least not into, in my case; the narcissistic grip of my mothers loving claws....then I'd not cry my way through this beautiful song every time finding more aspects....took/still taking me so long/much to repair myself and I'm sorry to all involuntary victims if this journey. Never even realised how f*ed up it was...cause I had so much worse. That's no excuse. Trying to apologise n improve.
Francesca Cozzolino	❤
Pau Martínez Dalmau	"Probably I wouldn't be the same person as I am nowadays without having listened to ""Hurt"" by Johnny Cash. I love it, forever grateful Johnny, Rest In Peace LEGEND..."
Alexander Lane	What a man
W K	Please the 24K that gives a thumbs down....Why?
Mars Timä	Der beste song ever!!!!
sharon george	There's no one like Johnny
mike gossner	"Give credit where is due. 
To make a very heavy grudge song to a country song. 
Very impressive 
especially his age. 
Never quit playing music 
to those musicians playing in today’s world."
mike gossner	Johnny Cash had that bad boy effect however more to the story.
Walter Frederick	Nascar driver Dale Earnhardt Sr. was a Johnny Cash fan and shared something with him.Both were called the man in black
Ryboy1122	This reminds of The Walking Dead, was it ever in an episode and what episode of you know
ethannnnn	"My mom has always liked Johnny Cash.
Heard a lot of his songs. Now I’m finally finding out he passed away. This does really hurt."
Keith Preston	It's astoundingly ironic that such a legendary figure was able to record this one final tribute to his life and work, only seven months before he died, and three months before June died. He knew his time was running out, and this was his final reminiscence and goodbye. And it's fitting that this song would be a cover of what was then a relatively contemporary, hip tune by newly minted rock star Trent Reznor. It demonstrates the multigenerational appeal that Johnny had.
Nae Idea	"Me and my colleague sung this pretty much every day for damn near 2 years, the rest of the company got sick of it, they ignored it, let it go, accepted it.. What a way to remember a legend. Not by remembering but by living it. Every single day.

I feel like there's an immutable bond between my passion and Jonny Cash now, it's in my soul if I have one."
weavy030	Thank you retroactively, Mr. Cash!!!
liam flanagan	yes a legend gone never forgotten
Frantisek Lupinek	Tears in my eyes every time I watch this. So strong. And it makes me a better person.
Linda Bowman	Am crying so much as I hurt for Johnny!!!!
Igor	Listen this when drunk & high.
Linda Bowman	Had to finish my night with this, I would to have met this Legend! A true Person with so much emotion!  X
prime191	why did I relate to this today
FairNut	I knew this song for a long time already but I just heard it in a movie and that caught off guard so bad that I just started weeping and even now after half an hour I'm on a literal verge of crying. Guess a few years of held up emotions didn't go to waste.
Glen Jordan	Never listen without crying
L337drums	The running his hands over the piano lid at the end gets me. That's how you say goodbye to an instrument you love.
Raymond Remmington	What a man what a talent what a life.. Rip
Uygar Kılıç	i love companion to Johnny with my guitar while this song playing
Invisa bility	Хватит рожать, чтоб не мучаться.
OldTrades	The song was so Masterfully covered by Mr. Cash.  The old footage adds to the emotion of how fast life passes us by.  And what we may take for granted at the time.  The recording was thankfully top notch, even by todays standards.  Cementing Johnny Cash final work.  Thank You Sir for many great songs!
Hiram Priggott	Makes me think about all those friends and family members that I have lost.

Mohd Mulysa	this song carve out a good chunk of flesh from my heart and fill the hole with eternal sadness. :-(
Y3arZer0	I had my 99 year old grandmother listen to this today. It's been almost 20 years since my grandfather passed away.  He was a bombardier over Germany during WWII and she loved Johnny Cash. I'm just glad I could meld my music with his/hers.
SMASHVILLE6217	In the last 4 years I’ve lost both my best friends, both my parents, 11 aunts and uncles and my dog. My world has become so small and I just can’t shake the feelings. I look through my phone and half the contacts are dead ! This song hits me different every time I hear it.
EVITERNITY'S CHANNEL	Amazing song, amazing clip, amazing person!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
ROBERT	Sorry Jhonny, but Taylor Swift broke your rocord for beating the Beatles! Taylor is LEGEND!
Steve Kralik	Rick Rubin recorded and produced this track at his home where he had complete control of the gear being used. How the heck did it end up so over-compressed and clipped? How does a professional recording engineer screw up so monumentally? Seriously, if I knew nothing else about him, I would refuse to ever work with him based on this. What excuse could he have? He should have set the mic gain correctly before recording anything; a basic skill. If the recording went well, then he intentionally compressed it in post and intentionally made it sound like dogshit at the loudest part at the end.
Emilio Sanramon	Eli's crying jag song
Indigo Zen	Deep

cherelle	Man Johnny went crazy on this song one of my favs...❤❤ rip MR Cash
Joe Shmoe	I like to think that Nine Inch Nails wrote this song for Johnny Cash to sing, this was his song to send off with. The realism in this rendition is one that is truly felt through everyone. Masterpiece.
Birkin Sornberger	Holy shit how did I never notice that's June Carter Cash standing by the staircase???
Mike Hopkins	"Not to be disrespectful,
this was his swan song.
We all end up in the dirt."
Rick C-137	Greatest of all time telling his story before he takes his last breathe

Юрий Удаленный	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
John Graziano	What-a-song...
nickthefox72	The original version is good too
Sarah Irini	"Πληγωμένος


Πλήγωσα τον εαυτό μου σήμερα
Για να δω αν ακόμα νιώθω
Εστιάζω στον πόνο,
Το μόνο πράγμα που είναι αληθινό
 
Η βελόνα ανοίγει μία τρύπα
Το παλιό, γνώριμο τσίμπημα
Προσπαθώ να το εξαφανίσω
Αλλά θυμάμαι τα πάντα
 
[Ρεφρέν]
Τί έχω γίνει;
Γγλυκύτατέ μου φίλε.
Όλοι όσοι ξέρω
Φεύγουν στο τέλος
 
Και μπορούσες να τα έχεις όλα,
Το βασίλειο της βρωμιάς μου
Θα σε απογοητεύσω
Θα σε κάνω να πονέσεις
 
Φοράω αυτό το αγκαθωτό στεφάνι
Πάνω στην καρέκλα του ψεύτη μου
Γεμάτος με διακεκομμένες σκέψεις
Που δεν μπορώ να διορθώσω
 
Κάτω απ΄τις κηλίδες χρόνου
Τα συναισθήματα εξαφανίζονται,
Είσαι κάποιος άλλος,
Εγώ είμαι ακόμα εδώ
 
[Ρεφρέν]
 
Και μπορούσες να τα έχεις όλα,
το βασίλειο της βρωμιάς μου
θα σε απογοητεύσω
θα σε πονέσω
 
Αν μπορούσα να ξεκινήσω ξανά,
Ένα εκατομμύριο μίλια μακριά,
Θα συγκρατήσω τον εαυτό μου,
Θα έβρισκα έναν τρόπο."

Easy Guitar Lessons Grandpa Allen	"FYI: Trent Reznor of 9"" nails wrote the song.... and actually had success with it....when Johnny Cash covered it...it was now his song. He owned it as he introduced it to not only a dying audience but a new generation.  That my friends is the power of music."
Easy Guitar Lessons Grandpa Allen	Trust me...there will be no one brave enough to attempted to do a cover of that song.    I won't touch it with a stick...not mine can't make it mine.

Ledeya Baklykova	My former landlady told me once a story about her one encounter with JC while she was a nurse.  About a decade or so before he passed he was in a hospital for a non-emergency condition and she was explaining to him the diagnostic tests to follow.  He praised her for being so comforting in her manner, so reassuring.  He correctly guessed she was from the Philippines and asked her what motivated her to become a nurse, and an excellent one at that.  She told him that her two young sons were still in the Philippines with her husband, and she was here saving money and doing all the things needed to bring them over to start a new, better life.  At the same time both would glance time to time at the CNN report playing on the TV on the rise of white supremacy in the US.  JC said to her “ Well , May you find yourself reuniting with them here…you and your family deserve to live in this republic more than these fools do” pointing to the TV.

MCol	"Showing pictures of his mum when he says ""in the end everyone goes away"". Knowing that his wife died not long after this came and then himself passing. Then the old house he grew up in and recorded this video in burnt down shortly after that. Its such an emotional story. But he is now immortalised forever with his music."

Angel Noriega	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

21HectorLavoe21	"‘I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
'Til things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black’
-Johnny Cash

Ryan Strohbeck	Song hits so hard. The imagery is powerful including Johnny not being able to play the guitar chorus from his bad hands. Maybe he didn’t want to play it or couldn’t. Either is fitting.

John Paszek	"Very proud to say literally the earliest memory of my life was going to a Johnny Cash concert.  I think I was about 5-6 years old.  Watertown, SD high school gymnasium.   guessing maybe 1978-79?  Fortunately my parents 1) had an extra ticket and 2) couldn't find a babysitter because everyone they knew was going to the concert.   I clearly remember asking ""Mom, why is he wearing all black?"""
Robert Hart	"...Rick rubin s.. work w Cash in the 90's ..oo's...brought his Legend back StronG....I was reading ""CasH"" by Cash...when he passed..it hit Hard...then I watched this video...it hit HarD...2 months later...my Dad suddenly passed...it hit HarD....then I watched this video...

Kimberly Martin	My personal favorite that Johnny sings, it's so DEEP!
Mi Gomes	Great!
Whipplecharged Mustang	Song is masterful, it’s hard, tells it straight, full of love and hurt is who Johnny Cash is and always was, came up hard and dirt poor, he never was the best singer, and it didn’t matter because HE HAD A TALENT that was different from everyone else in his time, he wrote and played all his music, or most of it, June wrote some of it too, for me personally, he’s one of the greatest ever

Ryan Fever	I wish we could tell Johnny that even in his 70’s his singing was still great and almost 20 years later people still come back and listen to his later work, he never let us down
Brian Kady	Johnny Cash made this song his because he lived it. Trent Reznor probably had no idea that this song would enjoy the popularity it does today when he initially wrote it.

Shooting Words	Stowmarket is horrible
Shagbabyyeah	I always think about my dad, he has been alone since 2012 and whenever I see him he is so lost. I really hope he doesn’t kill himself.
Grendul	This song is a suicidal person's anthem.  When my plane gets here, this song will be playing.  It's not sad, but inspirational.  It's a reminder of life and pain.  It also reminds me that there's still one more door to open.  It's not exciting to end life, but it's exciting to leave pain behind.  JCs performance speaks to the soul.....something that I will have to thank him for in person.
Arthur Shelby	When he starts to cry, yeah that shit is heart wrenching...

Dace Bagata	Johnny made it much better than Trent.
bobhijita	You could see June Carter's sadness and dismay. I'm not so sure she wanted Cash to be remembered like this video had him. She was always about protecting the image of Cash. I'm like most others here: he is legend, and this was a masterpiece. The videography also deserves recognition for his interpretation(s).

Karen Folsom	A very beautiful and moving song. I am a Johnny Cash fan since the 60s and this tops the list. Rest in peace.
Sundown Gates	I'm  older than most ppl that will watch this. The hurt and disappointment of life in your last years is heavy. That's what kills you. It won't be your health, it will be the gravity of your life and decisions that will overcome your desire to go forward.
Steve Hunt	RIP to the MAN IN BLACK!! He looked SO SICK in this video....
Thanh Nguyen Duc	You guys just like me,knowing him only after his last song when it played in the movie that the protagonist is long gone
Tamara Roberts	❤
Ino Stiv	... E X C E L E N T... 💖
[Place Holder] Gaming	After finishing the Dark Tower series I can see why King had used the chorus in his opening. (The Trent Reznor version obvs, but I am really sorry this is a better version) It sums up Roland's quest for The Tower and what he continues to lose on his quest. The Dark Tower is Roland's 'heroin'
Alvin Wayne	I just wanna sleep forever
Eric Knudsen	Hurt never goes away just tolerable
Ayden Lindsey	Rip johnny cash legend to be remembered forever

TheEightiesareback Official	I'm speechless. BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Laraisthecroft	My gran used to write songs and sing with him. He used to jet her over to the states to help him with his music too. 🥰
Voiceofreason	Johnny Cash, one of the closest things to a saint that I have ever known, not because he is perfect, but because he was honest about his imperfection and his need for salvation!
JoeTheBot !	I like this song and I have also hurt myself so I can relate
KA C	In your endo...

Cartilla Briggs	Ive was a self cutter/burner fom 15 till 26... I had a relapse with the razor today... And as always johnny you helped me..
Andrei Gaming	When i heard this song i got so much emotional.
M W	IMO, still one of the best covers in music history and Trent's original version was absolutely amazing from the start.
Monika Williams	Ey, you´re still alive? I´m not up to date, but hey, your songs are also here in fucking Germany kulture, so, don´t we all don´t have things to tell? Yes we all have, no matter from where we are, life is for all of us not easy, so what ever people have some problems with Germans, fuck you all, do you really thing, that we, the regular people are the same, as fucking Adolf, no, we are not, that was long time ago and by now, I can only see stupid People, that has nothing to say or know anything.... time went by and knowlegd went by, was not kept, so only stupid people left, wich I hate, knowledge is importand, but passes by.. that´s just the way it is... sad, but thrue!
Charlie Kunjip	An old man saying sorry for everything he has ever done wrong to everyone.
Henry the8th	Badass.
cherryartmanu	essa musica sempre me arrepia inteira
Stephen a	"What a beautiful and heartbreaking song! I believe that he did it so well not only because he was dying, but also because had lived this song his whole life.
Paul Desmond played 'You can't Go Home Again' on Chet Baker's album of the same name. Desmond was dying and hadn't long to live and he knew it. Both songs are extremely sentimental, regretful and heart wrenching.
Thanks for posting this song."
Rosalinda Alcalá	Una canción para recordar el resto de la vida, con cariño y mucha tristeza! AB
Before the fall Humanity	"He was true to himself to the very end.
R.I.P Johnny Cash"

Biker Dave	but you never did
Tyler Gray	"I’ve been on a Johnny Cash kick lately and this song/video is so emotional.
Trent Reznor’s original was so great, but even Reznor himself says this is now JC’s song. 
God bless you Cash."
Ray Gilpin	Also I was depressed for the first time.
Ray Gilpin	This song hit me in the summer of 2020. I was depressed for a long time and I would have panic attacks because I thought I was gonna die. But what was scary is I know when you did that's it. Nothing. I was 14. I was afraid to go to sleep because you know the fear of dying. I remember I was just watching this for the first time and.couldn't breathe. I ran outside and had a breakdown. I was more scared than I had been ever. Now I have overcome it I'm almost 16 and now I watch this to bring back the times at my old house, even when I was well depressed.
Rogent X	He knew he was dying, and assumingely probably knew this might very well be his last song, but, he made sure he would give his fans and family one more piece of his legacy in this version of this song.
Nathan Giddings	Why can I never listen to this without it bringing the tears 😅
Max Power Gaming	I have listened to hundreds of times. But I lost my dad a few months ago and turned this on today and it's really rhe first time I ever HEARD the song. Man this is so dark but beautiful. The words to describe this song to someone who's never heard it before is almost impossible
Gene P	Miss them two🎱😔
Barbara Cochran	Tears falling blurring we all own this thank you JC for you timeless soul and priceless sound rip
Jan Vojtášek	Mám tě rád Honzo Penízi!!!
casey brune	"My first dog (a 13 uear is old black lab Airedale German shepherd mix) was named ""cash "" by us as his bark reminded us of Johnny's music (he lived to be 25 years old btw). 6 months from dying and Johnny blessed the world with this.. a storybook ending. Falls in line with my dogs death, he died 6 minutes after i finished dropping my brother off from school.. i held him as he died. Fantastic dog. Rest in peace johnny cash and my beloved ""cash""!"
Navid Shiry	Goosebumps. every time I watch this
Fil Banger	G.O.A.T
Mark Kane	First remake I've ever seen EQUAL the original.  Sorry, can't surpass Trent, and us old men can barely recall the anguish of youth. Trent wrote the poem.
Victoria Savaski	I absolutely love this song and of course Johnny C.  I love this philosophical song, so intense and that piano playing is like anticipating the end.
Arthur Robb	I feel that he epitomizes man
Arthur Robb	A man with a soul
Tony Stark	When you forget to put water in a bong and you hit it
N-A-M-I-A🎵	That's dope 🔥
Graeme Snell	"Ok johnny cash song  ( hurt ) is my choice for my funeral last 
Hoorah down the in isle,"
Wahidul Saheeb	The silent face summatively drag because barometer marginally scare along a fragile france. various, guttural H habitual flesh
Mané Farmer	The song is about selling his soul to build an “empire of dirt” and the regret of fleeing away from what really matters, faith Jesus Christ. That’s why he says if he could start again, a million miles away, he would because he knew what he gave up in the end was far greater than whatever early “empire” he made here
Chocolate onion	I grew up on Johnny Cash, my parents played him for my siblings and I.. I've always loved him. I do remember mourning his passing with my mother it was so upsetting, my family loved and adored him. I love you so so much Johnny Cash, you have an enormous imprint on my life. Thank you for sharing a piece of your heartfelt soul with all of us.
NienkeJoe	"One of the most powerful songs ever!
You can hear he is so old and still his voice is awesome. The emotion in his voice is so powerful.

I love that they used this song for the movie Logan. So fitting!

Rest in peace, Johnny and June. Both died too young."
Kevin Fowler	This has been my song till i was 21 and i will probably die with  it. God bless you Mr. Cash.
Brian Sutton	Another  song to be played when they gather around my casket
Rocco	Does anyone not realize he’s talking about being a junkie n how it effected everyone n around him n himself
Rocco	Being an active User while listening to this hits u differently
Luiz Eduardo Palhares	Chow-chow
Kenny Rodgers	This is what keeps me up at night. Just the thought of never being able to go back. We come from dust that's where we return
scott parker vs. the world	"The lyrics that 'hurt' the most are that "" everyone I know goes away in the end "" means friends family any support for the singer in nine inch nails with addiction(I interpret) and with cash its his family and friends passing of natural causes which is hurt in a different way"
THESUPUAJOHN	"I came here from Doctor Who and Logan.....dang Johnny Cash u sir...... triggered my despression 

Amazing song 10/10 (Sad to see him dead Couple Years ago and I gotta admit he was a good singer, not only good but a Fantastic Singer)"
Lalo Wilson	I'm sorry Trent Reznor, but this version is better than the original.

Jens Lysdal	Substantial
Keith Grant	Mutha fucking legend...#getthehellawayfrommeyouhear
Capullaceo	Masterpiece, period.
Joshua Clark	Yeah  what he said
DAVID A C RUCKER	I see the comments on this song. They are all accurate, but really apply to much more than the single song. Look up the album (American IV: The Man Comes Around) and the songs included. For years I have loved this album and feel that Mr. Cash knew his future as he created the album. And as a whole, the album is Johnny's goodbye! So goodbye, Sir!
Skid Vicious	The greatest crossover cover of all time.
nichol c	Legend always will be, his music makes me feel every single bit of emotion that he sings, this song its beautiful and depressing at same time I love his music always will Rest In Peace Johnny Cash 🖤🙏

Trevor King	"Just going to listen to this one more time and then stop....
P.s. I didn't stop, still listening to as you read this"
Amanda Pagan	This song is written by trent Reznor.  Its about drug addiction
Yossi Moz	I know it sounds weird but this song reminds me that I shouldn't be terrified of dying, but rather be terrified of dying lonely.
ironuckles	The definitive version of this song. It's interesting when an artist writes a song not realizing that another artist was really meant to perform it. Johnny Cash was born to play this song.
Tray Daniel	I just got finished watching the movie about his life and career called “Walk The Line” with Joaquin Phoenix did a great job playing him, Reese Witherspoon as his future wife June Carter-Cash, and Ginnifer Goodwin as his ex-wife Vivi Cash . R.I.P. Johnny and June Cash 😇🙏🏽🎸 and Vivi Cash
salamanca1954	I still cannot listen to this without crying.
JohnnyLightningV10	I met Johnny Cash as a kid in 80s. He was truly one of nicest people ever met and I didn't realize who he was at the time but he was shopping just like any other normal person in Eastern Tennessee.
Jon Redd	Jesus!
R T	Me cutting my toxic relatives off in the pursuit of a healthy and happy upbringing of my nephew.i want my nephew to not suffer the same pain I experienced.i feel I shouldn't be in his life either because I'm toxic as well but I was blessed with the  Godfather title.i just hope I don't make the same mistakes my parents,grandparents and great parents made.
Jordan Litz	I love johnny cash unfortunately he died a year before I was born but my dad has always been a huge fan and then it rubbed off of me.
spartygrad89	His voice still is butter despite all he is going through.  How can this song not gut punch you?   I am the last survivor in my family.  Not sure why.  I just try to carry on the legacy of good I was taught.
The Messenger	To leave a part of his soul for us to cry upon is truly a great gift, a life worth the pain he suffered, he knows that now but not then 💚🇮🇪💚 rest my brother, see you soon 🙏🏼
Asmaa Ragab	wow the song is incredible , i laterally can fell the emotions in his voice

Vivianna	"Full of broken thoughts
i can not repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
i am still right here
What have i become
my sweetest friend
everyone i know 
goes away 
in the end
& you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt
If i could start again 
a million miles away
i would keep myself
i would find, a way 🖤"

Peter Viteritti	That's dark!
Mac Harrel	Beau et triste à la fois, l'émotion est toujours présente...
M H	For how good all of Johnny Cash's body of work is, this cover is by far his masterpiece.. for me at least, this is it, this is his life in a song, so beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time.. it's hard for anyone with any empathy to not tear up when listening and especially watching the video with the song.. 😩 and 😊 at the same time..
inkvizitor	first song i learned to play on guitar bu tback then i didnt know what about was this song but now i know it. LEGEND

Thomas Baker	I’m here bc I saw this song on my HASS teachers recommended
Somewhat Damaged	The fact that this man not only sang a beautiful rendition of this song but he lived it too. RIP Johnny & June Cash
kgedeon gedon	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HokzLHiYs&list=RDMM
Tyler Meyer	You could have it all. My Empire of dirt. I will let you down...I will make you hurt!   Gotta Credit NIN (Trent Reznor) with the lyrics, but Cash's performance is SPOT ON!!!!!!!!!!
Tiago Bianquini Tres	Thats some heavy stuff...Its sad to know that dont matter what you do with your life, we are all worthless... in the end, the only thing that actually matters are what your family and friends shared with you during each one lifetime. Hug and let your loved ones know that you love them, we dont know how long we'll be around(or the ones we care about).
Coffinsmoke	Sucks when you know your time here is up.  Ending mine early. Later peps
sandp	fantastic
Ken M	I miss my old friend..Johnny, we all miss you.😥
Fat Pugg	Makes you realize how precious life is, and the people you love that come in and out your life
Douglas Dubois Barbosa	I'm Brazilian and Johnny Cash is my favorite singer
rrth556	Does anybody know the backstory of him at the white house? I always wondered.
Luciano Castillo	That he believed his empire was dirt fucked me up for a minute. Saying everything you worked for goes away in the end is a lie. He changed and influenced so many peoples lives.
Growth Mindset	Life is so precious.... thanks for reminding us of that Johnny
Kory Goodwin	I'm a 37 year old man and cried like a 5 year old girl when I felt this song. Cash is the legend.
Nathaniel O'Reilly	I love it when someone kills a cover better then the original! Bravo Cash you'll be missed!
crazy knowledge	my empire of dirt !!
Crimsonier	I dont wanna wreck the thing but the original is original. NIN version is better, but this is also kinda frickin amazing
Marc Legarreta	Such a powerful song. I feel it in my soul. RIP Johnny & June ❤️
Cam Hunt	What is the point of life? If we just die and everyone we love dies…
Master Jim	i LITERALLY AVOID THIS SONG BECAUSE IT'S SO DEEP A VIDEO AND COMING FROM mR cASH Im like who the fuck is cutting onions in here and it's like I can feel Johnny in the room.
mazen_ tarek	Every 13/9 we have to lesane to this song in his memories
NT Demireff	gorgeous
Homer	Everytime I listen to this I cry
Ralph In the Shadow Realm	It’s pretty crazy how he basically made this song his. Generally people cover songs and they can still be really fucking good too but the original is still so present and impactful it can’t really be said one did it better than the other (Disturbed’s Sound of Silence cover applies here). I think the only two example of a cover becoming the one true version is this and maybe I’ll Always Love You by Whitney Houston.
motri tri	Respects sir Cash RIP..
DudeCole110	Damn
Sean Austin	beyond words
Luciana Caón	Pqp! Essa música e esse clipe me deixam com o coração tão apertado...choro toda vez. Parece que ele está se despedindo. 😥💔

Todd Cook	Getting better
manblackpm	Trent wrote it, Johnny made it, imo. X
Kev Carlisle	This song makes me appreciate life so much, I’m only 19 but that last image of him 3:34 to 3:39 as a young man with a guitar and then his face as 71 year old only 6 months shy of his upcoming death is the nail in the coffin for me. He still grabbed a guitar and made a beautiful song that makes even a 19 year old cry from how fast life really goes by. Rest in Power LEGEND!
Tea_wit_Honey2	lets hope we see ol johnny again... you hear that? there's a train'a coming
Phase Change	Its at the end that you wish heaven is real and our wrong thinking is just that and  their is nothing you can only hope in your heart you get to meet back with your friends in this life.... a million miles away.
Christian Homesteading Biblical Gardening	what a moron, I guess he was never a Christian
clark johnston	Thank you nine inch nails for making such a great song for Johnny Cash to cover
Roman Pilots	"Make country music great again. 
Cus it has become overwhelmingly formulaic uninventive and predictable. 
This song is worth the thousands of modern crap country songs."

Jens Philip Höhmann	I simply cry – and I love it!
Eric Rosales	I get on a drunk and once in while come to listen to Johnnys cover to let it destroy me. It helps.

Mr Bogdanoff	This version blows the original out of the water!
Unhollowed _	There has never been any other song that ive really been able to connect with on such an emotiinal level like this one. I know cash didny write this song (main credit goes to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails), but cash played thisnsong in such a way that really captured the meaning behind it, and its the version that stuck with me
Kastnerzrule	One Word: Respect
Colin Johnston	Beautiful, powerful, universal.  Thank-you.
Klapps-Hill Duo	Incredible cover version!!! Makes me feel, J. Cash really felt he lived these lyrics? And poured his heart & Soul into this swan song. RIP
liliane guisset	Terrible...!
Татьяна Тарасова	Не особо хочется читать Википедию про него, в этих глазах я вижу жизнь и путь, что он прошёл.
Chaz Flemmings	This video is amazing. The way June looks at Johnny 😍
Stitchball	"Write your own shit man, I love your music but this song will always be the finale of the Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails to me. It makes no sense in this context. You take a song with powerful emotion and make your own cover of it, that’s fine I guess.

I’ll just never understand why people are obsessed with this cover. The video is powerful, deep and depressing, and an absolute masterpiece. But the lyrics make no sense in this context. It hurts to see all these young people think this is the original version. Just doesn’t have the same emotions attached to it. I do have a ton of remorse for the death of one of the best southern rock musicians of all time, absolutely. But god, this song just doesn’t work for me.

Maybe it’s because i’m a huge NIN nerd. I dunno."
Madartist2424	I’m sorry nine inch nails but this song belongs to Johnny Cash.

Clan Legio Italica	legend.
many dreams	For my soul that is still empty
Christopher Pausz	What a life Johnny Cash had. A legend among legends
Rhymes with Somethingy	He lived this song before it was written. It was unwittingly written for him.. the last bit of his soul went into performing it. If you know anything about his life,  and can watch this without being profoundly moved, you're already dead..
Greg Maier	Some people feel every note of this song until the end! 😞
Gigi	EVERYONE I KNOWN GOES AWAY IN THE END

Pao V	Those subtle shakes of his head hurts.
matt smith	In 2005 I went to get my Swiss training as a American watchmaker at a school called Wostep in Nuechatel Switzerland.  There was a little bar in the downtown center called New York bar and this song was one of the only songs on the digital jukebox that made me feel better when I’d miss home.  I found myself going to have a beer and listen to this song about once a week for the better part of 2 years.  It’s fucking epic!  I grew up with NIN but this one hit me at the core.  Texas boys feel Mr. Cash
Jose Gomez	Tremendous cover!

karan syal	You are a lucky being if it doesn't resonate with your existence
MrAchilles1984	When I listen to this song I really don't want to become old. I know it is not necessarily about that, but it sounds to me like a song of a man who he has seen all of his friends perish.

Robert Sanders	"I sat down in my chair, in front of our large TV, in our living room, with my two youngest children, when this video/song came on. I was in my early 40's & had been raised on Cash, Jones & Hagard.
I knew every old clip in the video, the clip from ""Gunfight"" the still photos from the 68 Folsom prison concert. As I watched this heart wrenching video, I could not help bursting into tears & my two children, age's 5 & 8, ran to me to ask ""what's wrong Daddy"" 
To this day I can't explain to them that my heart was breaking saying goodbye to an old friend 😢"
Matt L	Powerful song.  Something you really can't truly feel until you've experienced a full life.
Stephan Graeper	Sein bestes Werk: In San Quenton.
DreamOvDeath 	Musically this isn't a great cover because the genre jump translated oddly in regards to vocals but it's a epic cover because of the man doing the cover. If he would've had the chance to cover this song in younger form it would've been a perfect cover. But the context of this cover and its execution are perfectly imperfect and I wouldn't change it for the world.
Detroit Mckinney	What a career and glad he met a woman that pulled him outta HELL and had his back til the end. We all should be so lucky.
John S	Brings a tear to my eye what a man he was !!!!!!!!!
Abang Firman	LOGAN
BBQ Fixed	He was a very gifted man--one of the first musicians I can remember hearing at the ripe old age of 4.  Growing up I could not help but be drawn in by his music.  This video for me shows the imagery of what really is important in life--knowing the Lord.

1 Corinthians 15:2 - By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
1 Corinthians 15:3 - For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians 15:4 - And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Acts 16:30 - And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be Saved?
Acts 16:31 - And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy House.

Dan Holio	This is my Tunnel Song
Pete De	Some of his greatest work was his last.
Pete De	"I love this as well as Trent Reznor""s original but I will they have different meanings, I think original is about losing your friends and self to drug addiction and depressing and Jonny Cash's is more about aging and the regrets you have about past decisions."

Matheus Martins	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Caleb Benjamin	This music video adds so much to this song.
V Chandler	A lot of people don't know this, but this song is actually a cover....Nine Inch Nail originally sang this....but the key to a good cover is that you make the song your own. The legendary Cash definitely did this....!

P Mac	I know this is a nine inch nails song but damn JC makes this his own. emotional.
Lana Brock	A most poignant performance by Johnny Cash. I've never been much of a fan of his but there are a few notable songs of his that stands out. And this is one of his most emotional moving songs.
Novandi Novan	Respect buat engkong john....
The comenter !!!!	Rest in peace a legend!!
Weretoast	Johnny recorded this near the end of his life..He lived a life of Fame and fortune but this is a song from deep in the soul and I think he knew the end was near.
Aaron Sturgess	I was driving the very first time I heard this song. It made me so emotional that I had to pull over as I couldn't drive. There's something so painfully honest in the way he sings it that makes me cry. It did the first time and still does. Wow.!
rieks gnodde	impressive......
Jon doe	Whenever I want a good cry I just come here
Asaf Cygelberg	Johnny Cash's jaw in this clip seems a bit asymmetric. He had a wisdom tooth removed in 1990. I suspect that is a major part of why he looks like that. Speaking from personal experience, wisdom tooth removal causes problems speaking and singing, changed behavior, neck pains, various medical problems, etc. With the raise of the internet, the effects on people of wisdom teeth or tooth removal will probably become known as people would share their experiences online and discover a lot of them suffer as a result of wisdom teeth removal.

J Gallo Meio Antigo	"Life is a path, a no coming back path, it's impossible to live everything in this path, and we know it, so we make the unfortunate mistake of not trying to, then when we are at the end, everything you walked, looks just like a dot, a nothing.
Always, after the move, you see a better move, but not always you have a sacond chance.
Moral: nothing you don't already know..."
John cooper	Painful but beautiful 🙏
pageandink	That dude is telling his truth 🖤
Andre Uebbing	love from germany ....you are amazing
Danilo Junqueira	Uma das músicas mais emocionantes que eu conheço. O peso sentimental da canção, a voz, a instrumentação e, principalmente, o contexto do momento em que Johnny Cash a regravou e brilhantemente a significou dentro do que ele estava vivendo em 2003 é algo que beira a genialidade.
Rebel Dog	He was a true American Legend.
Reaper Of the North	"""You ain't ever gonna experience the way life kills a man unless you look around you and realize just why people are truly missed."""

James	Who I meant.to argue wit,,?
SkyRaider87	What makes this sadder is the fact that this was the last song Johnny recorded before he passed
James	This makes me patriotic and I'm  Scottish
Arktikos	To clear up any confusion, this song was written and performed by Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails back in 1994. To all of you younglings out there, learn to use the internet for fucks sake. It's not hard, just press the plastic thingies you use for gaming in the right order and you might learn something.

""cuz I remember, everything"""

TheCotzi	The moment he closed that piano is the most emotional moment for me in this song it ripps my heart appart i wish him back he is one of the greatest of all time
Joe V	Such a great song & video. Everyone involved - Trent Reznor for writing it, Rick Rubin for pushing Johnny to cover it, Mark Romanek for directing and of course Johnny Cash's fantastic rendition - deserves a ton of credit.

Amy Hayutin	My Dad died of covid December of 2020 after a wonderful long life. We just received some photos from someone who I never met of my dad as a teen, laughing and goofing off at a summer camp. Also a beautiful photo of my mom in her wedding dress. She is still alive. It was their 65th wedding anniversary today. Great collaboration on the part of Cash, Reznor, Rubin, others, and seeing June, young and old- very moving! Thank you to the director.
Dietrich Faust	God damnit. I can't listen to this and not cry.
LadyGrelka	There is so much pain in his eyes through out this song, and his best friend and wife June looking at him like she is going to cry, and looking like she can't stand to see him hurting. Through all their problems, all the ups and downs and hardships they held each other up, that is the kind of love I think everyone should strive for. May God bless you both and your family, Heaven gained two amazing soul in 2003.

SilliLittleGurl payette	EXACTLY.
XLiroCrazyX	me gusta esta cancion y no se ingles xd la busque en español y me pone agonico :V
Ellen Richardson	Wow 🥺😳 this song elicits a lot of depressed thoughts from a lot of people in this comment column. And we know there are several other younger artists out there that put out the most depressing stuff also! This is only the second time I believe I was able to listen to this song. Makes you want to turn around and commit suicide... 😩 Great song though but really, not a die-hard country western fan, but liked some of his more positive upbeat stuff 🤷🏻‍♀️ 💓

Todd Carlisle	Crazy thing is I never listened to Johnny cash young millennial here I somehow came across this song during a very dark time fighting addiction and depression I instantly felt attached to this song after hearing it a couple times I realized what it was about I can connect to it on so many levels now it just hits my soul so different I will get through this and not push everyone I love away!! I’m so glad I found this song, Johnny is a legend 🔥💯

TheGame Universe	"Last time I listened to this song... I watched my dad die of cancer from Agent orange that Viet nam and monsanto took from him....    as well as a wife who betrayed me...   I thought nothing worse could come...   then my dearest brother from when we were age 8 died...   and we were roomies after my love left me...      FUCK.. .life is cruel...

Find Jesus I guess..   but then again..  the world will sway you from that love too."

Jessica Curtis	This is so sad rip Mr cash.
Marcone JM	Obra prima essa música.  A vida é  um sopro,por isso aproveitemos cada segundo da melhor maneira possível.  Grande Johnny Cash
LiquidKat	I remember when this song came out when I was a kid. Probably around 11 years old and my grandfather was his age and on his way out. The feeing of loss and depression was abundant but made me stronger. Love you 🥲
Charlie Backman	"Original made a whole lot more sense. Lyrically, its nearly impossible for me to imagine a man of that age having such an immature perspective. Sure, it sounds reflective at times, but in such a rudamentary way that you can tell its within a very narrow scope. If someone with 65+ years were only able to express themselves as basic as this, i probably wouldnt be able to take them seriously. If it were a no name old man writing this as an original song, no one would care, and no one would give it the time of day.

This song works best where it originally was. The forcefully ironic give this version way too much credit. Listen to The Downward Spiral 3 times in a row today.

Rest In Peace Mr. Cash."
YoutubechannelMax	Я недавно узнал о его творчестве! И то что его давно нет с нами.... Берегите себя!

田中	"I hurt myself today
（今日、俺は自分を傷つける）
To see if I still feel
（まだ感覚が残ってるかどうか確かめるために）
I focus on the pain
（俺は痛みに集中する）
The only thing that’s real
（この痛みだけが唯一の真実であるのだ）
The needle tears a hole
（針で傷口をえぐる）
The old familiar sting ※01
（古傷の上を何度も突き刺し）
Try to kill it all away
（すべてなかったことにしようとしたとしても）
But I remember everything
（すぐに記憶は蘇ってくる）
What have I become, my sweetest friend
（俺は何者になったのだろうか、友よ）
Everyone I know goes away in the end
（皆、俺の知ってる奴らは最後には去っていった）
You could have it all
（おまえはきっとすべてを手に入れられる）
My empire of dirt ※02
（塵で塗り固められた王国で）
I will let you down
（俺はおまえを失望させるだろう）
I will make you hurt
（そして、きっとおまえを傷つける）
I wear this crown of thorns ※03
（棘の冠を頭に載せ）
Upon my liar’s chair
（偽りの玉座に座る）
Full of broken thoughts
（狂った考えで頭の中は支配され）
I cannot repair
（もはや取り除くことはできない）
Beneath the stains of time ※04
（過去の栄光にも値はせず）
The feelings disappear
（その感覚は消え去ってしまった）
You are someone else
（おまえは他の誰かであって）
I am still right here
（俺はまだここに佇んでいる）
What have I become, my sweetest friend
（俺は何者になったのだろうか、友よ）
Everyone I know goes away in the end
（皆、俺の知ってる奴らは最後には去っていった）
You could have it all
（おまえはきっとすべてを手に入れられる）
My empire of dirt
（塵で塗り固められた王国で）
I will let you down
（俺はおまえを失望させるだろう）
I will make you hurt
（そして、きっとおまえを傷つける）
If I could start again
（もし、もう一度やり直せるなら）
A million miles away
（100万マイル離れた場所から）
I would keep myself
（俺は自分自身であり続けるだろう）
I would find a way
（きっとそういう道を見つけられると思うんだ）"

Alejandro Sejas	Goosebumps! Amazing song

Hermi	wow! das Video ist mir mitten ins Herz gegangen... Johnny Cash hatte Charisma mit hohem Wiedererkennungswert! Es zeigt die Vergänglichkeit des Lebens auf traurige aber Charmante weise.

Bubba Walker	Say what you want but this told me i should never hold a grudge over someone...they are not with me forever make the best of times each other i would say this to everyone put down ur phone and make memorys with family when they pass away you will regret not doing so
Jukka Montonen	Tired man singing one of his greatest songs.I hope I will see you in heaven if you are there.
gimme dahhcookies	"""if I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself, I would find a way"""
Guillermo Daniel Tevez	muchisimo mas que un gran artista
Random Aviation	to whom the 23K people who disliked this, fuck you
Angee Day	"The sad part to me is that he seemed to have NO JOY, NO PEACE about his life, or atleast this song portrays none. 
Surly and hopefully he believed in Jesus Christ, the only way to have true and pure peace and eternal life with those that left him in the end. Death is just part of life!!!"
Jonah Frost	The rare instance where the cover is better than the original.
Kowareta tenshi	Honestly after so many years of having to control my emotions just to get myself back on track to semi mental stability it’s become genuinely difficult for me to express myself and just cry… so this song really helps me push past that and let it out
Johnny	"That's a lot of views Johnny Cash.
I only wish you were still here to see it."
Eric Pattin	That song was meant for him. thanx trent for writing that song so johnny can covering it.
R4cKz	i fucking miss her...
Suhrud Bangal	"When he says If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way- does he mean he'd keep himself distant from everyone he hurt and start a new life million miles away from everyone?"
Suhrud Bangal	I cry to this song quarterly without any alcohol.
TheSpaceDrake	Tio ben músico👍😎👍
happytownesvanzandt	Masterpiece. RIP dearest John.
Jeffrey Witt	I like the original but Johnny took it to another level, I’m thinking he does a better job than nin
1965 Chevy	Had there ever been a more emotional video and song before?  I think not.
Duncan Neave	Amazing cover, but I still feel Mr Chow did a better job.
Kaitlynn Lacombe	Heard this song for the first time in middle school,  I'm now in my 20s and this song still gives me chills.
bryan morrow	welp, here i am, rock fucking bottom.
Stengerling	He and of course his songs are legend. I highly respect him.
Nheil Marc	He made me listen to this, now this song stucks in my head.

Philippe deux	Vraiment très belle chanson !!!
Lethal slaughterband	"I read this comment somewhere




Someone doest cry because they are not strong enough its because they have been too strong"
Kevin Clark	I work on the Frederick Sound in Alaska on a cruise ship and I fell in love with this song. I have been almost in tears at times alone.  I downloaded it on iTunes and I just play over and over again. Just now we passed a town in Alaska, and we all scramble bc the internet comes and goes depending on where we are.  I am seeing the video for the first time and seeing it from that context, as it has been mentioned, just ties it all in. I’m headed back home to Nashville, TN where I also work at a hotel downtown near Broadway when I am not cruising the Mississippi and Columbia  Rivers or way out West. I recommend so many people to the JC museum and a great little diner next door called Sun Diner, (not sure if Sun is still there, it was shut down for a while due to COVID), but I love JC and but never went to the museum, bc the hotel industry is so busy there and there is never time. When I’m on the cruise boat and I play Cash, our guests just sit and listen, especially at night as we close up the bar, it’s religious. His music is just so legendary and seeing him now has really made me sad. One of my favorite songs already!
Doz On Life	THE greatest cross-genre cover of all time. Every listen makes me tear up. Some make me bawl. This particular listen was the latter.
KROGAN loves kittens and puppies	Its. Pretty I incredible Johnny Cash is known not just as a country music legend but just as a music legend in general.
Android Sam	The courage that it took to perform this. A lifetime of regrets, failing health, and unacknowledgement by the public in his later years. To take all that head on and be honest about it in song and on camera knowing that it might all be ill received by millions as he was approaching death. That's what you call artistic risk. I always liked the Man in Black, but this song and video impaled him deep within my consciousness permanently.
Beth Garner	Such a LEDGE
Bob Ajaj	At the end there's nothing left but memories....
Emmanuel Trejo	Logan..
G@M£CUBE¥	Thisns so fucking good i love it
Frogwithaflaregun	And to think, this song came out a whole year ago!
DonnyMayhem	This man means more to the music world than folk will ever know.
Mark Crew	I heard this song on Person of Interest they played it when John was getting Vengeance on Jocelyn's murder. That scene was so intense. I hunted this song Down glad I found it this video is absolutely incredible it will bring you to tears the depth of it is beyond description.
David Fitzgerald	saddest video iv ever watched!!! :(
daniel lima	q som. da pra sentir na alma a dor em sua voz
Sean B	This is the Greatest Johnny Cash Performance EVER!
Benny Badbyxa	Well what can you say - its just hit me - number one for ever !
Thanny DeVito	The only song that ever brought me to tears. Now he's playing for The Almighty, I just hope that some day I will join him in heaven.
NNGGAARRYY	Rip what a legend X
Barney Kenway	when I feel sad this helps
Running Moon Band 	Some of The most important life lessons in this song. Coming from someone who has also been in the shitter. :)
Queen Bee	Das war wohl sein letztes Lied rip mein idol
Dan S	if there was a song for the way i am now its this.
Darth Bossk	Gut wrenching. It’s remarkable that someone as iconic as Cash chose a cover- a deeply personal song written by another man in a dark moment- as the ultimate crescendo to an incredible life and amazing career. If this doesn’t move you, nothing will.
LULU	Mi hijo partió escuchando esta canción, cada vez que yo la escucho hay mucho dolor en mi corazón.
Noel Gomile	"I met my granny today, she just seems so done with life. She lost her only daughter sometime ago and then her closest relatives and friends and eventually her nephews and nieces. Now she barely has anyone that she can talk to but is happy to see me visit her occasionally, she talks about how she just wants to finally die and go rest in peace. It saddens me to see her so lonely and yearning for her friends and family, now that most of them are gone, she has us but it's just not the same. 

I really wish I could tell her the right words to make her feel right but that just doesn't cut it, it can't heal the pain inside. I dread to think how lonely I'd become from losing most of the closest people to me. Growing older is tough mostly when you start to notice yourself not really being the person you used to be and coming to understandings with that. Long story short, cherish the people around you life is short."
Jeffrey Poirier	There will never be anyone like this guy again he's a legend
amanda smith	The original by nine inch nails is about the pain and confusion of a young man. Johnny Cash’s version is about the pain and confusion of a dying man.
ichad c	"Can't figure out if I'm going crazy or not...For NIN fans, doesn't some of the visuals also pay homage to the NIN song ""Perfect Drug"" ?!. The amount of respect for the orginal artist is all over this. Two legends of different times."
K.	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
bdyt	I believe Trent said he didn't realize he wrote this song for Mr Cash. Those lyrics, holy crap
Cant Decide	Who disliked this that's what's wrong with the world
The Knave	"That is as Outlaw Country as it gets, folks.
Epic finish to his career."
Cherry Simpson	Miss Mandy says she loves you.
Joshua Dorsey	This is probably my favorite song. :(
Jacob Portnov	What have I become
Davie Dood	"I have an idea.. For all you MOVIE MAKERS out there... I don't know if some famous fn guy will see this or not. But if they do, how about this..


You see this right here? This video? They talk about selling their soul for rock and roll right? What if you got ahold of one who TRULY did?

He's old... He's thinking back on his popular YOUNG days... Give him a flash back. Not just in his ""memory"". Pull out your writers pen make a few strokes... And it happens..

They young people forgot about all this.. It's pushed back into a dusty old shelf in the back. Surely ONE of them comes forward and makes yet ANOTHER impact.

Let the old man have one more round.. #GiveHimYouth"
Evan Mattos	still here
Its qx	Logan, what did you do?
JayJay Golden	I thought of a movie idea about a billionaire with amnesia in a giant underground facility being one of the last remainders of humanity, finding out who they were and what they did and how its partially their fault the world froze over. And the movie ends with this song playing as they take one last walk around the place before opening the giant protective doors while the words 'my empire of dirt' get sang as we see the frozen wastes.
Kenny Dole	Hadn't watched this in years and I totally forgot about June watching from the stairs.  Couldn't keep it together after that.
The Saint 927	Christ is LORD, and His Blood 🩸 makes peace between man and GOD.  Johnny was not perfect, but his faith in the blood made him perfect in the eyes of the almighty.  I look forward to meeting him in heaven.  Ephesians chp 2:8-9
Paul Brooks	"Wow
Evem Trent Reznor
Said after Johhny Sang this song
It was never his again......"
Dazmeister General & MC RawDawg	"I have problems
I listen to this my problems go
The song finishes
My problems return"
StnlyZeR	damn this is from last year? feels like this video was released on 2015 or sumthing
Elder Pereira	Algum Brasileiro curtindo musica de verdade?
bigchungie lungie	"I find myself coming back to this song during many difficult times, but this has gotta be the hardest. For almost three weeks my dad had been battling covid and the problems it brought with it. It just created a domino effect within his body. It hurt hearing him beg to come home bc he was so afraid to die alone. Thankfully he was on a ventilator when he went, he felt no pain. It was the hardest decision my mom and I had ever made; keep him alive and prolonging his suffering, or to let him go peacefully. Knowing he suffered already with many demons and issues, this would only crush him if he were to somehow pull through. He had ptsd from being in the military, a messed up back, diabetes, hypertension, feet pain and so much more. We'll miss him so much. He may not have been a perfect man but he was a good man, always a fighter until the very end. Even after his ventilator was shut off he just didn't want to go until he heard my mom comfort him and tell him it's okay. Only then he finally rested. He was only 44 years old..

We had our differences he and I, but it never changed the fact I loved him and he loved me. I'll miss playing video games with him, listening to music together such as this song, telling stupid jokes, hearing him fart all the time and try blaming me. Life will never be the same ever again. But at least we can finally sleep at night knowing he went surrounded by his loved ones and finally free from everything. I love you daddy, take care and rest now. I'll see you again one day"
No Middle Name NMN	What a swan song. A legend until the bittersweet end. Thank you for giving us the words, Johnny.
Moonboot Hikes	Best cover ever! Especially when Trent Reznor says after the fact it’s like he almost wrote it for Johnny Cash without knowing it.
Schwein Schwanz	A drug addict and alcoholic it's what I have become.
Claudia Moyano	Sos un maestro ...un grande ...sin palabras ...me emocionas tanto .. bendiciones Jhony !!! en mi soledad me acompañas cada dia ...GRACIAS TOTALES !!! DESDE ARGENTINA

Praise Indeed. Proving different genre's Can Show respect!❤😎
Media Tributes: Criminal Minds Episode ""Elephant Memory"" and movie ""Columbiana"" used THIS Version as their Closing musical pieces........ In each presentation it MADE the Episode/Movie Complete!!🤙
Rest IN Peace, Mr Cash.
Jesus Has you Now!!🙏"

Evil Fluff	The sad thing is he knew that his life was at the end. His health was slowly failing. And his wife will pass first than his within months.
The Paradox Destroyer	😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
bruggetje	The comment section is full of despair, dastruction and affliction. People been put to a stop when they hear this song. People start to look negatively towards life and the path their walking. While the Holy Bible tells us to rejoice, be happy on where you are right now and enjoy every minute of it, it is a temporarily phase of your life on what you are right now. You will look back upon it and inspire others. You could be homeless, addicted or lost someone you loved, things will change. Have faith into yourself and the way life goes, as God holds you as you are a pearl in his hands. How miserable it may be, it shall be turned into something good, maybe not for you, but definatly for someone else. Keep hope, and remember that we are the children of the most high God, whatever happens in life, is in his hands. And we are all a part of it.
KiraLea Simms	🖤🖤🖤FKN BEST 🖤🖤🖤
EraserHead619	One thing I learned as I got older is that “Everyone I know…goes away…in the end” is something that’s devastatingly true. I’ve watched my friends slowly drift away, slowly move on. When we would talk every day now we talk maybe once a year if that. Hell, I’ve even been to a funeral or two for them… it’s tough but you begin to realize that it’s just a part of life and the best thing you can do is hold onto the memories and be thankful you made them.
jacqueline hauser	johnny is a legend and he rapes this song.
Jonathan Melton	Song makes me just wanna end it all😪
StrangeTimes	As it should, I hope it was Johnnys last intention to leave us with this one song  that will always steer us on the right path and keep us remembering our past.
Ethan Burrows	I may only be 13 but Johnny cash and frank sinatra are some of my favorite old artists
Katterinabellic	A legendary song sung by a Legendary Singer. He will never be forgotten, what a man.
Marshall Hosel	So powerful

V	God that’s powerful
Polterguist	NIN is better. lmao
TJack	I just want everyone to know Johnny wasn't sad in the end. He was leaving a message for those of us who new how to find it. There is a solution to your problems, but you can only find it from within. From one addict to another.
Vivian Motts	The tears flow every time.
Dania Morales	Gulp.......... Life is truly short - savor each day with those you love.
CursedFox	does this guy ever make new music? if I had to sing the same song since 1950 id blow my damn brains out
PANKZ MAGAR	This song takes you back to where you started Ur undefined life  😌❤️
Todd Connelly	"I believe that Johnny Cash has been a Christian for many years.  I have made plenty of mistakes in my lifetime. We all sin. I'm 61 years old and a musician. We, as musicians, are drawn to the darker side of life... especially when you've had a bad childhood experience like he and myself. I see where Johnny was coming from. He was saved early on, but never came to a ""relationship"" with the Lord. He realized, toward the end of his life, the time that he had ""wasted"". This is a song to warn  others of what really matters - an opportunity to redeem ourselves. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails actually wrote the song, and I think he might be facing the same demons, even though he had a great childhood - he's a messenger.  I think Johnny loved this song because he is urging others to understand what is most important in life - not fame or riches, but ""knowing"" what comes after this life. And I, for one, believe that God is the answer"
Mark Draeger	Awesome song but that fucking drug will destroy the human race!!! And that sucks!!! Johnny cash is the bomb!!! How can anyone not like him and his music???!!!
CHRISTINA DESWOOD	CAMELICIOUS IT'S DELICIOUS!
CTurtles	Trent Reznor has outright said that this song isn't his anymore. Johnny made it his own.
Vinny Griffin	I just was looking for a song i could jam to, not one that would stop me in my tracks. This is an absolute masterpiece, I'm privileged to even hear this.
Larry Griffith	Everything about this song reminds me of Leonard Cohen. A brilliant approach.
Julie Shrout	Brings back Joe times
Valentin Gloin	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Dusty B	This song came out on September 16, 2002.  About 10sih months before I was born, and even now almost 19 years later you still see people commenting. Music really does transcend time
Phitsamay79	I'm sniffling right now. Not from anything medical. RIP JC.
C LR	hey look it's every drunk hillbilly's favorite song
Kaden Peters	The nine inch nails version is about a young man struggling with an addiction, unable to get past it. Johnny Cash’s version is about an old man reflecting on past regrets, especially when he signed with a record label. It’s crazy how the same lyrics can be manipulated to create two completely different stories that revolve around tragedy.
Iván Lombardo	AGUANTE EL POSHOO PAAA
stanfordcoffee	"I can usually keep it together until I see the genuine anguish and concern on in June Carter's face.
The next in line and the song is ""everyone I know goes away in that End!"" Knowing that June past four months before he did and watching the piano/coffin close, always does me in."
Notsuspicious the judgmental	No song gives me more chills
Andrew Clayterman	Johnny's playing his autographed George Harrison acoustic.
SnapOutOfIt	I already loved his rendition of this song. But listening to it with the old photographs takes it to a whole new level. I grew up in the 60’s and 70’s and I remember THAT Johnny Cash. I’m still wiping my eyes from watching this.
superimposedtab	Only Johnny Cash could make Nine Inch Nails sound better.
Cesar Vialpando	Si la musique avait des initiales vous y seriez probablement inscrit. Merci pour votre œuvre

Hippy282	Every time I hear this it never fails to stir something within me. So many other songs can be loud and do nothing. His can come from the background and stop me in my tracks no matter where I am
Fred Cormier	This song makes me feel I'm running out of time. RIP Johnny Cash, I miss you.
Jj Jj	Its all about love and pain and they all go in the end but only one last for an eternity in another form and time
SpilledSalt 486	The symposium of him being in a museum that was dedicated to him but is now closed makes the song mean so much more. The video is as good as the music and Johnny Cash is a genius for choosing this song to leave here while he goes.
chris wadley	"To The 22k who gave this song a thumbs down..
You have no taste"
Lourival Pires	A inveja o ódio não podem destruir a terra o vento o céu e a música não sou cantor eu sou a música kkkkkkkk a kkkkkkkk shalom fui
Alex Gonzalez	Chao sing this song very good
Janice Pedroli	At thievery end of the long Serenity Prayer we say with tolerence toward all.  Have family heroin addicts. Their lives are train wrecks in slow motion.  Have held heroin babies to help care for them.  Their lives are one long scream.  They might stop for 2 hers to sleep. We all come to earth with lessons to learn.
keion edwards	This is about a man who wished he didn't sell his soul, he would trade his empire of dirt for salvation and if he had another chance to do it all over again he would choose differently, the closing of the coffin seemed like he accepted his faith
J Davis	As someone else said, I too live a fairly lonely existence and aside from work, I dont have a lot of human contact. So this amazing tune works soooo well for me!! I feel it and understand every place it takes me! This song touches me deeply and while I do love and respect NIN for their work and this song, I feel Johnny's version is soooo perfect for him!! I too feel that the video probably works to highlight his life and his last days with us. Simply to say, this is the correct song for the last days of his AMAZING life!!
Angelo Rocha	One of the greatest and saddest songs ever sang. Trent Reznor was born to write it and Johny Cash was born to Sing it
Ish	Big iron
Detroit Terrance Thomas	"Lord have mercy this song is  so real in my life
 right now!...💔😢🙏🏾🙌🏾☝🏾"
Christian Scholz	"What have I bekomme
I will make you hurt"
Victor Ankudinov	I love this version of the song, it's very sad but truthful and honest. However, after watching the video for the first time, I understood Johny's version (and especially a clip) is about aging... He's so old in the video. And the footages show him young. According to his vocal I feel he sings exactly about what has feels, sings from the heart, that's why he chose the Nine Inch Nails' song and made a cover. Because it's about him.
Hussein ali	This song is fucking dangerous
Matthias Lissel	big hug for trent
Utkarsh Kashyap	If you're watching this song in 2021, then you're a legend.
Denchello	I'm only 15, and i always thought i'm at end of my life, but after this song i changed my mind and now i think i am at beginning,but life is very short, we should live a life we will remember, rip johnny, thanks for everything

Chris Dvo	If my soul ever wrote any song.... this could have been it.... whiping tears from my eyes....
DEAD1YASSAS1N91	I'm only 30 years old but I would give it all to go back in time to where music wasn't complete shit like it is today
Between Frames Production	I get goosebumps, sadness, appreciation and some more sadness all mixed together from this powerful, powerful song.... Jesus, this song hits me hard... Aren't we all but a breeze in the wind of this existence...
Kevin Harper	This is the most powerful the most painful, it's like opening up a broken soul and getting impaled by the spirit of regret. He was always a pioneer and risk taker. This trumped everything he had ever done because of its brutal honesty and his willingness to expose those ghost in his closet that only his final call will destroy
Jay Crazy	A true legend you’re always gonna be missed
Fridge Gobbler	I watch this with a tear in the eye of a man who had it all and still looks back on his empire as nothing since it will all end up as nothing eventually.. I'm a 25yr old man, or boy what ever way you put it.. But god I wish I could have the balls to get it over with already! I have no pleasure from life as we know it.. I have no motivation to work my life away for 60 yrs and get left with a crappy pension all so I can buy a crappy house and a half decent car. Get married and have kids, just to end up wasting all our savings getting divorced once the honeymoon period is over in a few years, then have to only see your kids every other week because you don't get on well with your ex wife or something then just die a lonely old crippled man! I just want to go out into nature. Build me a log cabin with a dog and cat or two and live there until I'm dead! I have no interest in riches, clothes, cars, supermodel women. gold, silver chains whatever wealth you might want.. Me living on my own in the woods with some loyal animals and living off the land sounds like winning the lottery to me! Sometimes I think I was born 100 or 200 years too late! To many luxuries taken for granted now. It's just.. .. Sad. Life is, Sad.
YEAH OH	A song for our American Mighty Troop.
Chris	Saddest song I’ve ever heard..
John Doppleguard	"In my head I hear both of them singing, simultaneously. Every time .
It's fu king good man.

Luka Basilaia	If Johnny covers any of your  songs, it's no longer yours ))
DevAmp86	I remember in 2009 listening to this song with my good friend Murphy, talking about everyone we lost.. Murphy passed yesterday. Rip Murph til we see each other again.
Love Is Gonna Save Us *	Reminds me of my dad who committed suicide 10 years ago this month. This song breaks my heart so much I rarely listen to it but its beautiful. You were worth so much more than u thought... We miss you terribly. Love u Dad ❤

Jason	Logan you still got time
Connie Killion	This is one of the saddest songs I have ever heard. We are all in the lyrics, times are hard and dangerous, we will all go away in the end. Today is the day of salvation...Billy Graham. Rest In Peace Johnny you are finally with your Savior 🙏
John Doe	"I was a 90's kid. There were less bands then and fewer ways to consume music back then. Trent Reznor was a legend in every junior high. This song was one of his main hits. I didn't think much of it, far from his best work in my opinion - an uncommon opinion at the time. The first time I heard this version by Cash I didn't know it was a cover. Awestruck by the song I wanted to learn the chords and lyrics. And a chill washed down my spine as I realized it was a remake of NIN. Trent has always been known as a songwriter above most in the industrial metal and pop metal genre and this is pure testament to that as he was never meant to sing it IMO. He hadn't lived to ripe old age, and more importantly, he hasn't had the pain Cash had. To be a bull in a china shop his whole life, crashing his way through relationship and addiction and achieving fame and fortune to match his and desires, to be ""it's my way or the highway"" his whole life and his ability and fame enabling that behavior for decades. Only in his last moments to realize it was all for naught. He'd built an empire of dirt and it cost him every relationship he ever had -- True Regret only realized at a time of impotence, too old and weak to do anything about it. Too many years had passed since the match was thrown at the bridges he now wishes were intact. I never believed Trent when he said ""I will let you down"" but I hear the pain in Cash's voice, a final realization after sixty years, a sad revelation that he has hurt everyone he's ever known in his entire life but said with the strength and conviction of a man late in his life. Absolute fact, however sad or shameful.  I never believed Trent when he said ""If i could start again.... I would keep myself.... I would find a way"" but it feels obvious with Johnny. This song was always meant for Cash to sing and not even he would have known it in '94 when it was released. It's poetry 30 years in the making is what it is."
Joe Wagoner	I think I feel the way he feel in this song sometime and it reminds me what we can handle
Joe Wagoner	This song will make u rethink about life and everything u have
Kaio Ferreira Melo	Live Jonny cash
Rule Breaker.	NIN original
Kevin Hegwood	The best thing about this song is that Johnny Cash made it his own.  I've listened to NIN's version many times. Johnny 's version hits you in the feels.

Otakar Frankenberger	Everybody is general after the battle.
Русь	I think the meaning of the song is that whoever person is rich or poor.  Life is meaningless and empty for him if he does not accept God in his heart. But if a person has accepted God in his heart, then there is a meaning in life. Even if a person is the last sinner. God will not leave him if a person sincerely loves God and tries to correct himself.
Erik Bird	When you accidentally write songs that already exist 3.
Darlene Motley	"Satan offers the Empire of dirt.  He was lamenting on wishing who he had served his life for.  The answer is Jesus Christ.  It's never too late until you die or Jesus comes back which is very soon.  Who do you serve? Who is your Lord?
Johnny and June are with the Lord."

FallNorth	"Every so often I come back to this song but other day I was listening to Rush and realised how much of the song was the same.
If you like lyrics listen to ""time stands still"" by Rush. It's like this but more sneaky :)"
MDReflections	For whatever it may be worth..I'm not a fan of this song..both NIN and JC versions. To me, it's just too much of a 'good' thing. Idk. It doesnt get me in the feels like some others from NIN, especially on PHM and Broken. Not judging or hating, just my opinion.
StepEdits	No other song will break someone like this..
Seth Burleigh	its crazy to me that johnny fucking cash was listening to nine inch nails and was so unbelievably moved he had to cover it to put a cap on his career and ultimately his life.

Joey C	"He Speaks on the reality of Life.... There's so much Wisdom in this Song.... Something We can all relate to. Johnny cash enlisted in the United States Air Force on July 7, 1950 (Korean War) he was honourably discharged as Staff Sergeant, and he returned to Texas. Thank You For You're Service ⚔️🏆 
He began to write songs, too including the First big hit ""Folsom Prison Blue's"" this Song ""Hurt"" is one of my all time favorites where Johnny Cash express his painful suffering's highlights of his Life (He Love His Wife ❤️ So Much)
And the bitter harsh reality that everyone goes away in the end.......
""REST IN DIVINE PEACE  MY BROTHER WARRIOR⚔️ 🎖️AND FRIEND🙏"

I would keep myself

Lita Loesch	Every time I listen to this song it reminds me that our life is lived in nano seconds compared to the ocean,  the earth 🌎 , and sky.  I live with intention and awareness.  JC and his wife June were forever in love,  through all the good times and the bad. He realized when she left,  his life was complete.  I know in my heart, they are together again,  and how beautiful is that? He was authentic and never wavered.  That's what made him a legend.

Julian D	The clips of a “fallen” Christ mixed in with Johnny’s moments as he aged. Fuck. Whoever edited this, you are the man. I remember watching this on tv when it first came out. Made my whole family cry

JoNatHan K	"I love the line  👑 of Thores on My Lier's Chair.
I think of something like the Iron Throne."
Rick	Purely legendary. While Trent Reznor did a good job writing the original, Johnny owns this song now. Reznor himself even said that. It is singlehandedly one of the most emotional musical performances of all time and it hurts even more when you know the backstory of how he was near death, his wife was dying - he was saying goodbye but not in a fairytale way, which makes it all the more impactful and stunning. I hope this song leaves a mark on everyone that hears it - I know every time I hear it it gets me. It is probably the best cover ever done. Rest In Peace, Johnny Cash.
3C	Nine Inch Nails made this song. But this is Johnny’s song. The hurt, the pain, the foreshadowing of his death. Perfect. ❤️
Bois Nation	A legend...
Wayne Gabriel	The perfect song for him. Rest in peace John. You deserve to.
Shearon Fay NEWSOM	Johnny Cash miss you if people only knew the feelings that I have and had for all my patients I remember the chats we had. Thank you for CROSSING my path and being a part of my life. Rest high on that mountain.
Huw Thomas	I always loved someone and I never said anything, Shame.
Suilug Ferenthon	Oce in a while I come back here to take my medicine
Aimee- X	This song always hurts my heart, it’s so emotionally powerful. When you know what he had to go through in his life, everyone suffers at some point. Rich or poor, young or old, life’s journey can be painful! Takes nothing to be be kind to someone and nothing to be nice, it could make or break someone’s day saying hello or not. I watch “walk the line” every few months and the story always touches my heart. God bless Johnny Cash🙏🏼❤️
Paris Vergos	Not a good idea to listen to it after a break up. Just do not do it.  It will  hurts more. Just take this advice and dont make the same fault as i did. Because my break up hursts twice because i remember everything with this song. But in general this song is awesome. We love u jonny

GWB	"I’m not crying, you’re crying 😢 

But in all seriousness. I love that he reflected on his own personal experiences while covering this song. Makes me cry every time I hear it. It makes me reflect on my own life and recognize what I might be taking for granted, not appreciating, and stressing about the small shit that doesn’t matter."
CINNAMON	This is one of the only songs that has made me cry
Vanessa Caetano	I love this

 Sadly, I didn't make the choice to stop and it cost me my marriage. 
 I'm clean and sober today. And grateful.
Removed my crown of thorns and got rid of the liars chair."
Jackie Acheson	"When the NIN version came out, it was quickly one of my fave songs. When I heard that Johnny Cash was going to cover it, I was like meh, who cares? 
Then I heard it on the radio. By the 2nd verse I was bawling like a baby. I could feel what he was feeling when he sang it. The regret for the wrong doings of his life. Today was the first time I've seen the video. Bawling again. I hope he is at peace."
Mænn	"""Everyone I know goes away in the end"" that is a very sad phrase honestly, not looking forward to that"
Mr. Fun	Thank you for this great song.

Roy Stenson	discover his back catalogue, worth it
dctrex	Wow beautiful, timeless!
Vinegum	Rest in your peace and the best as you gave.
Mr. Baseball	When Trent Reznor heard this in full he said that Johnny Cash was the original curator and that Nine Inch Nails are the ones who covered this song. There will never be a song that can break your heart like this can. RIP Johnny. We miss you 🖤
Dmitry Vidarr	legends never dies.
WACOMON	Not gonna say it's better than the original but there's something about Johnny's voice and him coming to the end of the line that just makes this version even that much more powerful
Daniel S.	This somg is a great inspiration to fight on in life - against all trouble and pain!
Michael Quinn	Using this for the Logan teaser was brilliant, promotions for those peeps...
M Hartung	At a certain point in life one becomes aware of their mortality and ponders what was, what is, what's coming, the inevitable. I have come to that point, God willing I have perhaps 15 or 20 more years and they will pass in the blink of an eye. Funny how days seem  long, yet years disappear so suddenly. Never take any day for granted my friends, life is oh so precious........

Rest in peace legend...

Аскар Сыдыгалиев	9 9 = 18
Curious George	I am close to sixty. I have so many disorders that my medicine keeps me emotionally disconnected. Sometimes all I feel is pain. This song resonates so deep with me, especially this version. I find more difficulty in trying to remember. Everyone I know goes away in the end. My brother recently committed suicide and it has made me appreciate life and realize we are only human with traits and flaws. Sometimes it can be such a burden being in my own head. Our time here is not forever, nor is it promised to us. Try to be kind to one another.
xotic YT	"“Everyone I know goes away in the end”

Jesse Rocha	Mr cash did this cover better than the original
Brian Francis	I started over at the age of 42 after getting divorced because the love of my life revealed that she had been cheating on me for 10 years and 3 kids later. Devastated. Completely heartbroken, and crushed by life, I heard this song.

Candy Sandoval	22k dislikes=demented sob's this dude sang to prisoners and was an addict, he gave a shit for his fellow man so fuck y'all
John McGarry	Mr. Johnny Cash met his savior never to return to us. We however, can meet Mr. Cash if we let the savior save us. Jesus and Johnny forever.
Daniel Hernandez	Still hearing it...
chuddle	I’m 52 and I can tell you this. Your friends and family will die away one by one. Your hair will turn grey and you will lose a step year after year. Death will become less abstract and more of a certainty over time. You can fight it or be at peace with it, but either way, it’s coming. So live every day like it was your last because we are all standing on the edge of eternity.

Jack Franco	I found this song during my darkest time of depression and helped me through it. Now, I am back here once again as my grandmother, whom I lived with since I was little pass away today. This song is truly timeless. I hope it help you and other's as it help me too. Stay strong!
Tac	I'm 24 years old. The first time I heard a Johnny Cash song was when I was around 6 years old on Tony Hawks underground 2 (Johnny Cash - Ring of Fire). That song has stuck with me ever since, almost two decades on. I know sadly Johnny is no longer with us but ever since hearing this song, it's really hit me how short this trip is. This 'song' is almost not even a song, more so a cry of advice to anyone and everyone growing up. Take damn care of yourself, stop caring about money, fame, acceptance, anything. We are so caught up on having some sort of reputation and it's all a load of sh*t. It's something we've created, such as time, money, power. Just stop caring. We aren't around long enough to make a dent in time so just fkin' have fun while we're all here. I wish you all the best x

Eddie Silguero	😭😭😭 thank you Trent Reznor and thank you Johnny cash, two amazing musicians 🥰 RIP JC,
rockratt23	Not much of a fan of Cash and not much of a fan of cover songs. But for Jonny Cash to cover this Nine Inch Nails classic about a drug addict and relate to an elderly man in the final days of his life in the manner he did is truly remarkable.
Jack Plonski	i don’t think i have ever cried so hard
Trevor Perkins	When Johnny Cash covers your song, it's not your song anymore.
Luis Claudio De Souza	Maravilhoso Man in black!
Jon Habash	120 million views cant be wrong, i just sang very badly to this amazing song, wept from half way through, fucking special song, and man.
adam martin	"I know this song was written by Trent Reznor but when Johnny sings it, so much pain and suffering in it. ""Everyone I know goes away in the end"" has to be the saddest line because its true."

Cheyenne King	"I miss my daddy.  This song brought him to tears, I felt bad that I played for him. But he was happy to hear Johnny sing it.  Like everyone, he loved Johnny Cash.
My father passed away 8 years ago this December. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of my dad. 
Archie Royce King I sure do miss you. I love you daddy.❤"
quantumphaser	The best there ever was.
Lord Nemesis	Every time I hear this song it makes tear up. This is the best song he made. It makes me remember the old time I spent with my dad
S X	"Whoever listened to Trent's version and thought, ""This would be great for Johnny!"" Is truly a visual and innovative. This version is miles apart from the original. I think this one resonates with more people. Who doesn't have regrets or eventually waits for death wanting to rejoin their loved ones. At some point, what you acquire on earth doesn't matter anymore. It just takes most of us decades to get to that point. I envy those who reach that pinnacle of understanding and acceptance early in life."
Brenda Curtis	We played this at my son's funeral. Summed up his short life all too well.
Barbara Nagy	I love this song.  I never knew it existed until I watched a documentary on Johnny and instantly loved it.  Now one of my very favourites....so powerful, sad, beautiful all in one.

Elhentari 今	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
boone	I have lost the most important person in my life I hurt myself today over an over I still feel pain only if there was away s.l.f.
Keanu the Beaver 🦫	This song deserves 1 billion views Johnny cash ❤️
Bnsf wood valley Subdivision	Big fan tried not to cry at the end but had to
Steve Skelley	I remember, the songs he wrote and the real person came out.
mariano acevedo	hey que triste bello tema
Alexis Botté	Love you.
Elena Cisneros	"Angel the ""cholo"" if you could call him that the one from chula vista introduced me this song I wonder why its crazy because I swear I had a history that would relate me to this song idk I really hate him. he is a stalker"
Sabnox	We'll all end up alone one day provided we don't die too young. You might have family younger than you but everyone you grew up with in your life will be gone and you just have to live with it. No parents no grand parents.. At that point you'll be ready to die. And the cycle continues like it has done for thousands of years.
InstantSwagger	"Random dude: I bet there isn't a good singer that didn't die from drugs

Cash: hold my beer"
John Bluth	Some of you people are fucking stupid this song was written by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails not Johnny fucking cash. How the fuck did this transcend genres like that. Fucking retarded millennials. Do your research like you do on everything else and then go fuck yourself. NIN for life 🧠💣
Crovik	This song is great but I love the original version
floracer77	the voice in that song brings tears in my eyes!
YouKnowWho	"""I stubbed my toe... last night"""
Janette Martin	I dedicated this to my family
Devolutionone	Made fun of people saying they cry when listening that song, no tears on my face but my eyes are definitely not dry..
Edwin de Vogel	Repent,
drunkardjohnny	How in the hell is Johnny’s version better?   The original song was bad ass.  Man in black still kicked the originals ass.  Now onto paranoid by Black Sabbath
Ar Jay	Damn, right in the feels.
Jonathan Greene	Damn he was the best
The 82s	"One of the greatest covers of all time 

I’m not an emotional person but I could feel his pain through the song. It pulled at me."
Hal Truong	First song I ever hear of him, it touched the bottom of my heart. I have my fully family around me, but you make me feel so lonely now, the lonely you (or the character in the video) are feeling, the feeling that one day, the people who I know, was gone, I'm never repaired for it. So lonely, Johnny, so lonely.
CHRIS #INCOGNITO	"Damn...

Nothing else to say..........................."
Basil Von Nobody	This song makes me appreciate life. Seeing someone in old age talking about starting again… I realise, being 25, I am at the beginning. So make the most of it. Make a life you want to look back on. You lose almost everything on this journey of life, but pick up pieces of your final soul on the way. As a wise woman once said; youth is wasted on the young.
juan jose osorio posada	i just wanna know, what is the original song? because this is so very beautiful, so how will be the original?
Allison Kelly	What a genius. Thank you so much. Riveting melody, haunting lyrics. Just absolute perfection. Jesus lord above there is hardly a comparison.  That's all.
Don Doyle	Every day is precious live it like it was your last
music man 1970	This song represents my live I am a senior citizen.
The Big Sign	I'm the reason that I believe in abortion. My mother made the wrong choice.
The Big Sign	I used to love your world of dirt but now I hate it Amen.
Alright	damn this old man version gets real as fk
Mike Lightbourn	I wish people could read deeper into this,,,
John Wipf	"Total legend, from rags to fame and riches, at the end it all goes away.  At the end what purpose does life hold?  

I want from owning $2 and a few clothes when I left home at 18 to starting 2 companies, traveling the world, going on mission trips, and holding numerous labour jobs.  It's all empty if it was not for Jesus Christ.   You die and than what?"
Mo Bro	Lost my mother,  my best friend,  my partner in partying 4 months ago today.  We loved listening to this beautiful cover  between generations
Silvio Schröter	see you old felow i cant await !
Steve Dangerous	The Love and Pain in June's expression is extraordinary. The world was better for having these two people in it. Thank you both for showing me I am alive.

Almir Pinheiro	Que isso mo fio! nois tem Pablo vitar , Anita,  Simone e simaria e mais um punhado de coisas assim🤔
Edgar Humberto Alves Filho	"As Solomon declares in the Holy Bible, ALL IS VANITY. Cash, in the twilight of his life, has this understanding and makes this confession. Realize that everything he has achieved (and I believe it was the hard way) he claims to be his ""Empire of Dirt"". Do you know why? Because a coffin doesn't have a drawer. The reflection remains: WORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT MONEY CANNOT BUY. Know how to give the best destination for your soul."
Edgar Humberto Alves Filho	"Como Salomão declara na Bíblia Sagrada, TUDO É VAIDADE. Cash, no entardecer da sua vida, tem essa compreensão e faz essa confissão. Perceba que tudo aquilo que ele conquistou (e creio ter sido às duras penas) ele declara ser o seu ""Império Imundo"". Sabe por que? Porque caixão não tem gaveta. Fica a reflexão: SE PREOCUPE COM TUDO AQUILO QUE O DINHEIRO NÃO PODE COMPRAR. Saiba dar o melhor destino para a sua alma."
Gary Hooper	22k dislikes, I'm guessing this hit most of them harder than they would like to admit
Jean de Fleuret	you always cry when you listen to this sound
Bad Guy 	Minha música favorita dele, ao lado da solitary man
Aditya Mohanty	everyone i know goes away in the end...

j smith	Hauntingly beautiful and emotionally  powerful, it makes me cry every time  I listen this song.
Fektthis	Johnny and June. Til death do us part but not for long. Be right there with you so you're not alone.  RIP both.
Paul H	"lyrics (just for me):

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Bernardo Jimenez	Please Donald Trump make America great again
Pepper Scholtz	Bananas and jellow
PVK Oz	Johnny Cash may have let people down, but he lifted more people up than he let down. Research what he's done and he's actually pretty damn good, yet coupled with regret. No one could do this song like him.
Krehlmar	"The endling of an epoch. The turning of a page, the end of that era. A dark, black, hand reaches to shake yours. It's familiarly dry, cold, firm but gentle. You reactively end the shake with a hard grip, respect. 

You look up, the empty clothes gaze back at you and you realize. You know. You're shaking hands with your corpse. But you're not the hero or point of this story, no, you're the other thing I am describing. The other thing haunting it's own memory, the thing realizing it's already lost. You're already dead."
Spoonmeat	Over the past year I've made some terrible mistakes and lost everything;  career, wife and children. This is my empire of dirt. Beautiful yet reassuring song.
Feral Panda	Can't believe that's nearly 20 years ago :(
Dj Trixxx (official)®	When I need to be strong for others I come here listen in a room alone shed some tears, regroup and back bein strong for my wife and kids.
Petra Kann	Very raw
hombreenojado	The back story on Cash recording this is incredible.
PVK Oz	What a song, what an interpretation. Sometimes that happens. Like Hendrix's cover of All Along The Watchtower even Dylan says it's not his song anymore. And so it is with this fantastic song written by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and he says the same thing that this song is not his anymore, and that's not a bad thing, but yeah Johnny Cash just makes it his own.
raelyn111	Truly amazing...breaks my heart and brings me to tears every time I play it or hear it.
Steven Barnes	"While we appreciate the Man in Black let's also appreciate the genius of Rick Rubin for talking Cash into covering this song. Cash didn't want to make this song because ""it wasn't his style"" and Rubin talked him into it. 
Besides that this video chokes me up every damn time I watch it."
Marco Valfredi	Da pelle d'oca...bastano i primi 2 accordi  che già sogni.....
Baron Mauve	toujours des chansons éternelles et une très belle musique 💕 toute mon enfance et m'a jeunesse merci une époque formidable 💕 repose en paix Mr Johnny cash 💔👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Thank you Johnny, thank you.     R.I.P"
Chad Jones	Sadly there is times when I feel this way probably at my worst in life. Depression will harm and destroy and eventually kill you from the inside first. Just isolate on my property and leave me be. Life can be awesome and it can suck.

Sproket 202	Llevo escuchando esta canción desde hace un tiempo y siempre me hace llorar. Es una melodía que toca lo más profundo de mi ser y hace querer valorar, más de lo ya hago, a quienes amo, porque no siempre estarán ahí y tarde o temprano deberán partir. Sé perfectamente que Nine Inch Nails, el vocalista, compuso esta canción originalmente, pero ésta... hace que la prefiera más. Buenas noches.

It’s like this song was meant to be for him to sing…his voice and the way it tells this story is something that can’t be explained it’s truly fitting and to think this is a cover!!!The best cover of covers IMO.

Anne Thomsen	"Johnny Cash . I love and honor your  memory. 
His last very beautiful and touching song I hear daily.
 It hurts me incredibly and makes me cry like never before.
 The song evokes strong memories of my father who unfortunately was not strong enough to protect me in my childhood against  my dominant mother and brother. 
My father he sadly passed away in July. 
He died exploited and lonely of Parkinson's disease with deep conscience towards me and strong emotional pain.
 The wounds were never healed alive ! 
My Dad looked like Johnny Cash in so many ways. 
An authentic human and soul he could identify himself with true the music.

Anders Andersson	"All the Bible Words comes from New International Version 
You are very loved! John 3:16-18:
16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 

How you get saved! Romans 10:9-10:
 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.

You can only get saved through Jesus! John 14:6:
6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

You can not be saved through your own deeds! Ephesians 2:8-9:
8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—
9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 

God can forgive us all our sins if we confess them! 1 John 1:8-10:
8  If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us."
J Kelly	Dam I feel for June.  I wouldnt want to go on if my love died and it was just me.  This would be my last song and creedance to the young.
nellers710	"thank you Trent Reznor for allowing Johnny Cash (an iconic idol) to sing your song. 
The emotion in this song is strong. Even if you're not an empath,  or if you've never experience the hardships that Trent and Johnny has gone through, you can feel it. 

If you don't hear the ""hurt"" in their songs, then you're a lost cause. You don't deserve Johnny Cash or Trent Reznor."
ErikD 804	Eerie Premonition of his death ..repenting for his past.. lifes value is only worth the mark you leave on other people.. genius!
ben zambrana	This is one of those songs that doesn't seem to get old. There is no other song that can be compared to this one,  Trent Reznor realize this after listening JC cover his song.
pxydust80	"Wow! This is incredibly chilling. As a fan of NIN, Trent Reznor has always been protective of his music. Interesting to see Johnny Cash do a rendition of the final song from ""The Downward Spiral"". It's profound and very depressing, as it was months apart from June's death ultimately leading to Johnny's death. From word of mouth, I heard Trent was in tears seeing this."

Muftaay	"What have I become? A question that I literally asked myself today.. Wasted so much time in front of my PC. Now I'm 30 with only ""online"" friends, no gf.. basically no social life.

I lost 12kg in 2 1/2 month's and now my body looks normal, taking care of my home and myself, looking much healthier in general. I feel so much better, I can't help but smile sometimes when I look in the mirror because I'm proud of the results my efforts have shown in the recent month's. Despite all of that, I still don't really know how to talk to people and socialize.. I feel lonely man"

Michael Word	Time waits for no one.
Abner Alarcon	He made me think it was his song
Eric French	I can feel his pain..
Matthew Crome	"I think Johnny and Trent really conveyed the message of deep emotional pain in different ways. Both of them were drug addicts and were emotionally troubled, which the song definitely communicates. For Johnny, I think it was also about aging and coming to terms with his life no longer being the same as it was when he was young. I think it's incredible how the lyrics (with the exception of ""crown of thorns""/""crown of shit"") are completely the same, but the versions feel so different."

Byron Burford	Chilling.....And true  love ya johnny
Summer Hampton	The reason Johnny makes it so much more bone chilling than Trent Reznor did is because he lived it throughout his entire life. That's not to say Trent doesn't know what he's talking about or anything. No song has ever made me cry but this one and it does it every time without fail. Thank you Johnny Cash, you have awakened a new desire within me to live and stop trying to kill myself as I have throughout most of my life.

KVNG	RIP Johnny Cash bruh😭💜
21HectorLavoe21	I wish more people took the time to research and learn more about the life of the iconic Johnny Cash. There is so much footage of him here on YouTube. Concert performances, his performances at CaDOC prisons, his first ever performance of “The Man In Black” the day after writing it, documentaries, intimate interviews, late nite shows appearances, his own TV show in the early 70s. The more you watch and learn about him the more in awe you will be and the more you’ll find yourselves coming back for a rewatch of this jewel of a music video. RIP MIB🙏

joe mcguire	As long as we’re doing strange but arguably superior covers can we get Elton John to do a System of a Down song? What would that sound like?
von ha	life s................... this song makes you  felll love it
Leholen	Had to come back to this after hearing an auto tuned version. It was painful to listen to, so much of the emotion had been stripped away. This song never fails to bring a tear to my eye and make my heart feel as if it’s breaking but the auto tuned version couldn’t invoke that reaction.

Steve Freidhoff	That is haunting and sadly lot of people feel this way I for one do
Ezra Mantini	I hurt myself today…
DerpySuX	"To me the most powerful use of this song outside of this music video is at the end of the CM episode about the high school couple that lashes out against their neglectful parents and acquaintances. This song softly plays in the background as the boy is talked down from shooting an agent, being told that if he surrenders he will be given the opportunity to say goodbye to his girlfriend before he’s taken away. 
He was just a hurt kid looking for solace"

Deutschland ist nicht mehr das Land in dem ich geboren wurde. Deutschland ist in der Hand vom Islam. Macht die Augen auf und ihr seht es
Andrew Ward	I think this song hits so hard because it plays on a fear I think almost every human has. Which is when you are at deaths' door and you look back at your life and find nothing but hate and regrets, for all the wrongs you have brought upon your loved ones and yourself, to die not with a happy content but with a whimper.

Sidewinder	Love this song… my soulmate died June 25th from a massive heart attack at 52… it was our song… He spent 12 years in prison, left a broken man, we met and he changed his life around. He Started his own business in Forest Tree cutting in the mountains for the residential communities. After losing all his family to death, we both knew the pain of losing those we love and all we really have is an empire of dirt as material stuff is just stuff… moments spent together and always saying “I Love you” daily no matter what disagreement or irritation we are bothered with means nothing in the big scheme of things… We shared many a slow dance to this song, blessed we had each other

Colliding Worlds Music	That voice!!! It is just so perfect for this song. I was lucky enough to see Mr. Cash at Westbury Music Fair on Long Island when I was about 7 or 8 years old...didn't know who he was at the time, but I still remember the show. He was, of course all dressed in black and the venue is very small and in the round with a rotating stage. I have seen many other shows there over the years, but this was my first. Unforgettable. If you get a chance, check out my tunes and let me know what you think. Peace out!

Zayne Mikita	Find me a song today that tears you apart like this. I never appreciated Johnny Cash until I got older. The reason I think is because he is as real as it gets. Life can truly be brutal and beautiful too. Thank you for this.

John Smith	Each time I hear his song: Goosebumps and tears rolling down the road while smiling. Thank you 4 this masterpiece and R.I.P. my dear Johnny
Just_Jay1281	You can feel in this song, that he struggled to forgive himself for all the wrongs of his past. I think this song will ring true to anyone that has demons they have had to face. He speaks as an old man who hurt his closest friends with his alcoholism, and you feel that regret in this song. An amazing man with an amazing story, which he told in every song he wrote.
Seasalt Sanji	This man poured his heart and soul into this music whether you like it or not you got to respect it
Shane H	So moving on the inside.
Una Kennelly	I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I first heard this extraordinary interpretation. And I'd bet many others do too. My reaction was... speechlessness.

Ilya Koryavov	"I am 32 now. I listened to this song drunk on whiskey and then had this moment of revelation. I actually realised I'm gonna die one day. Be gone forever. Left without any chance to compensate for any sin I've done. I spiraled into this thought until I decided to share it with my best friend (yes, I still have one). And he told me this thing, that.... uhm, made me reconsider. He told me ""You are scared now, you are full of life. But what will you be in 40 years? Will you still want this life this bad? Maybe you'll be bored and tired of it."". And I gotta say, this thought comforted me greatly."

Justified By Faith Alone	Dear Friends: Do you believe in the true Gospel of Grace? Jesus Christ DIED for our sins; He was BURIED, and He ROSE AGAIN on the third day (1 Cor. 15:1-4). We are saved by GRACE through FAITH in the BLOOD atonement of Jesus Christ. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8-9). Trust completely, with a heartfelt belief, in the blood atonement and finished work of Jesus Christ today! If you have made this life changing decision to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, please let me know, and I will pray for you.

Bonafide Tyler	"""Pain's an old friend""
And we get along together very well."
Casperian	"Yes, this is a sad song but here it's being applied to Johnny Cash's life as if his life was something to be sad over. 

He had fame, fortune, talent, recognition of that talent to the point that became the 1 in a million who make it to the top, and then he had the things that mattered above all, a beautiful wife and family that stayed by his side. 

Yes, he had some trials in his day but give me a break, there is nothing ""sad"" about his life story. He had it all."
Limer	Our desperation led us to settling for worthlessness. We have prioritized the tyrants of our hearts, and now… well now we’re lost.

Wyatt Jones	I just went to Bristol VA, and thought of this the entire time.
Donnell W	Johnny Cash was such a passionate singer who used restrained variations of his voice for maximum effect. That's why his songs easily endure the the test of time. His work gets better with age because he's uniquely gifted.

Maria Mireles	This song hits me hard cause it's the TRUTH, MONEY, FAME, HOUSES, CARS , JEWELRY are just materials we need to sustain Our lives and ONCE we die, it is NO LONGER ANY VALUE TO US,  cause MONEY, JEWELRY or  even FAME WILL NOT BRING YOU BACK.

Ernie S	"""For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?"" Mark 8:36. Drugs, money and not changing your path much, will show you why he wrote this song. I have known people who knew Johnny Cash very well. Something to think about. The love of money is the ROOT of ALL evil. Never forget that. Only our Lord Jesus Christ can redeem and forgive your sins, and only following Him will give you eternal peace, love, hope and joy. 100 percent absolute fact."

james gordon	A technician came to my house to fix my air conditioner…he sees my guitar and proceeds to tell me how his daddy used to play with all the long ago country singers including Cash. His dad has a guitar with over 200 signatures of country stars ✨ on it as he mentions about every country singer that lived…including  how he played with Cash…then he mentioned the song “Hurt” and how it was written originally by Nine Inch Nails and how it eventually became Cash’s song…(I’m like WTF?)..so I decided to search YouTube and here it is in all its glory… reading the comments is fascinating…because an air conditioning repair man came to my house today…God Bless faulty AC’s….

Paul Dunkirk-Greenbaum	"America is a tragedy of trauma.
Are we ever going to heal?"
NOIVAS	"This is by far one of the DEEPEST covers and videos that has ever been created. Johnny knowing he wasn’t going to be here long, losing June before this video was finished, and giving us intimate details about the person he used to be and how any “empire” can easily fall and become forgotten. 

This song really breaks into your most primal sense of what it means to be human. No matter what you say about Johnny, this was his magnum opus and it will forever remain a song that he never wrote, but ABSOLUTELY embodied as his own. 

Knowing the history behind it… If this doesn’t make you feel something, I don’t know what will."

Ovidia Quiroga	Jhony cash, creador del dark country y el primer metalero de la historia. Su vida fue simplemente heavy metal. Y esta canción aunque sea un cover es para cerrar el telón e irse a casa con la sensación agridulce de saber que lo logramos aunque dolió.
Daniel McDowell	The weird thing is he did not rate it his  management  forced him to do it. Its a rare case of where the cover version is a billion times better than the original.Artistes you have got to love them ☺.

Onthewall4Yah	This song rips my heart out as it was so personal to John and to me as well.  My brother Gary would listen to this song and cry as he had the same struggles.  Sadly my brother could not overcome this demon and it took his life on May 16th.  He believes in Jesus (Yahusha) as his Saviour and I pray he is at peace and rest with Him in eternity.  I know Johnny will be there.  My prayers are with everyone struggling to overcome now at this late hour.  Give it all to Jesus, let Him carry your burdens.  He is coming for those who wait and trust in Him. Shalom
Triston Gosse	To bad he didn't realise all this before it was to late.
Aaron Meyer	Johnny Cash was a very good musician. He really captures the feelings of someone towards the endpoint of thier life or transitioning into the next phase of life reflecting. Very powerful song. His genra was country but he wrote a lot of hit songs even rock fans listened too. RIP JC.

I know this isn’t the original version but if MR Cash we’re still alive I would want to tell him that this was powerful, beautiful and heart crushing. Great respect to the man in black and hope to see you in heaven one day.

Abalam de Paimon	18 years he's been gone now :( All my idols are passing away, the things and people i grew up with and took as granted....10 or 20 years more and i will find myself in a world i don't recognize anymore...what happened ? I was just having fun at the 4 Bears park in Pontiac early 80's, listening to Footlose songs... if i got there now, there's a rotting empty park area...it closed down 30 years ago...and you know what happened to Detroit and surrounding areas.... kills me hearing this song, getting reminded of my childhood, and same time knowing it's forever gone, not just metaphorically, but also the physical reminders on this world....

Oh well	"Wasn’t even Johnny’s idea to record this song, he didn’t even write it. It was originally written about someone’s life beginning to fall apart, not the end of a life. Yet it is one of the most touching songs I’ve heard in my life.
God bless you Johnny Cash.
And everyone else who had any hand in this video whatsoever."
Alexandre De Souza Soares Luiz	what makes this song worse is that the higher the piano goes, the higher his voice goes, and it gets more end more painfull to hear.

Ino Stiv	Never will be born who can - DESTROY... YOU.., beleve me.. 💖
Русь	I understood only one thing in this song. How many people are chasing money for power for attention to themselves for popularity. And it doesn't matter who it is an actor, musician, singer or oligarch, or anybody else. If a person does not put God first in his life, then such a life is lived in vain. And no wealth and no power will benefit a person, it will be meaningless, not useful, harmful and destructive for the human soul. As this singer correctly said,  will be like dirt for the soul, which is difficult to get rid of later.  Think this singer probably realized how he lived and how other people live because he would not have been able to compose such a song without this awareness. Hope he managed to repent to the Lord to death and go to heaven.

Scott Brockman	"Wow, what a beautiful, moving  song. I actually  heard  this  for  the  first  time  in the  early  2000's as I was a  little  bit  moved to  tears. If I  could feel  like  him, it wouldn't  be  a  million, but  a hundred  or thousand miles  away, ""if I could start again, a million miles away"" knowing  that  the  majority  of  the  people  who  knew me way back  in  high  school, have  grown  up, moved away, got married  and  had kids, I honestly  think  that  they  changed  and  used to  be  cool, that and my own  ""screw you"" to those  so called  fake, foreign  women  pretending  that  they love me when  they were  just  using  me as a  penny  bag & they as some  sort  of  a  gold  digger ""you can  have  it  all, my empire  of dirt"". And for  the  record, I  have  no wife or kids, more  importantly  a wife or kids to come  back  for. It's  just  me, I'm  just  a  man. Sorry."

Every song either on a 45 or 33 or even on a cassette.  None and I mean absolutely none of Mr. Cash's song's brought me to my knees nor made me want to cry.  That is until I heard ""Hurt"" . We love and miss you Mr. Cash. There will never be another King like you"
SaveHouse	"Today I listen again to this song. 
Today I realize that soul will be fresh, but the body get old.
Today I realize that life start to hit you hard from every corner at one point.
Today I realize that there will be so much weight on ones mind.
Today I realize that there is nothing I can do.
Today I realize that I have to dealth with it.
Today I realize I will be alone on that path.
Today I realize I´am 29.

Ron Lee	I lived in Dyess Arkansas  in the 60's  . Johnny's home town and his childhood home there has been open as a museum. His brother lost his life working  at the saw mill there by falling or backing into a saw while it was running. RIP.

Robert Waters	"I've watched this video so many times. It never gets old. At 3:03 you can see June Carter Cash' look, she understands and sees John's pain and turmoil.

And those remaining maybe 70 years, will be too much of a heavy burden for myself.
Like I think is something I don't want to face, scared of how they will develop, instead of seeing a bright future.
I come to this song over and over, to drown some of those sorrows."
ThatOneGinger	"""Logan, what did you do?"""
Speed Racer	Though Johnny didn't write this song it was done by another band . His take on this is very sentimental and personal.  He had a battle with substance abuse and the video portrays that material things in life dont matter and so true we lose everyone in the end. Mr Cash lived a fascinating life and tip my hat to him .
Natsukashii Atsume	You stay the hell away from me, you hear?

Sobriety will never bee mine, for that im ok. I can control a drug, but i cant control the pain.... lost, deep in poverty, hate from my own people who hate me because the color is white & not brown. Halfbreed life...I wud wish 4 no1. My own is worse then where they point. As i sit alone with not a dollar 2 my name, I kno theres no 1 to lend a helping hand. I kno i cud go to a store & steal food to eat, & whites wud look the other way. Ive been condemned raising mine alone & loading my bag & cant pay. I kept us all together & raised mine for good to the world. But the hate still remains. My own people cant relate, cuz their so filled with this Hate. Jesus bled & So do I as im always lookn for the light.

Chris Henry	"The man came to the end of himself, in the end... What a selfless, prideless thing for a man of his caliber to cover somebody else's song. ""My empire of dirt"".. wether he sold out and took oaths to get where he got or not,  in the end I believe he realized it was all BS and vanity. The pride of life as spoken of in the Bible.. This song is anointed, and speaks deeply of repentance.. that's why if you have a soul, it brings to tears.. seek a relationship with your creator, not religion. Through all his pride and rebellion he displayed through his life, I believe he made right with The Heavenly Father in his end of days."

In 1996 he recorded the Soundgarden song rusty cage which, like hurt became a hit and in 1998 the album it is on, Unchained won a grammy for best country. R.I.P Johnny and I will never stop listening to all of your music.

me me	The added clips of him with the railroad, looking so happy, is what hits me the most. My dream is to be a railroad engineer. So seeing him happy, excitement from one end of his face to the other. Then to switch that to the sad man, pouring wine on his dinner, and wondering what he has become, makes me realize I still have a lot of life left to face, I shouldn’t worry, and I should enjoy it.

Gaurav Bhardwaj	"Trent Reznor says about the Cash version of Hurt: ""I'd been friends with Rick Rubin for several years. He called me to ask how I'd feel if Johnny Cash covered Hurt. I said I'd be very flattered but was given no indication it would actually be recorded. The idea sounded a bit gimmicky. Two weeks went by. Then I got a CD in the post. I listened to it and it was very strange. It was this other person inhabiting my most personal song. I'd known where I was when I wrote it. I know what I was thinking about. I know how I felt. Hearing it was like someone kissing your girlfriend. It felt invasive"". Johnny played this song over 100 times before he recorded it. He called it ""The best anti-drug song I ever heard."" The song was released as a single in 2003. ""One Hour Photo"" director Mark Romanek said: “I begged Rick Rubin to let me shoot something to that track” being instantly enamored of the rendition, he offered to shoot the video for free. Universal eventually agreed to the music video, but with 71-year-old Cash’s health declining and being unwilling to stay long in the cold Tennessee weather as he was going on holiday to his ranch in Jamaica that coming Saturday, Romanek had only days to make the video and after scouting in Nashville, he decided upon Cash’s home and museum in Hendersonville, Tennessee, The House of Cash. ""Arriving on Friday with no idea of what I was going to make"" Romanek said. ""I looked around the house and made a few suggestions of where we might film Johnny performing. I was making it up off the top of my head. Then I went to the House of Cash Museum and found it in total disrepair. There was no time to clean it up so I decided that I'd just film it, and Johnny, exactly as they were. He was no longer in his prime - he was fading and that was what I wanted to show. The place was in such a state of dereliction. That’s when I got the idea that maybe we could be extremely candid about the state of Johnny’s health - as candid as Johnny has always been in his songs. While I was filming the opening segment of Johnny playing guitar in his living room, his wife, June, came down the stairs and watched. The look on her face was so complex: full of love and pride and concern for her husband. So I asked her if I could film her too and she agreed. But the most important element was when we discovered a film archive in the museum. When we looked back at the rushes we'd filmed at the house we thought they were good but not great. But once we dropped in the archive footage of Johnny we realized that was the soul of the video. The whole thing was so spontaneous. It's made me realize that sometimes you can be too prepared and that there's some value to urgency."" The music video speaks about the transience of life, the gracelessness of death, the Ozymandian crumbling of an oeuvre and the decline of a genre, an era and an attitude. The ‘closed to public’ sign on the museum. The cracked platinum records. The caviar and lobster banquet with no diners. The clips from earlier in Johnny’s career. His wife June looking on. The closed piano lid. The video was so intimate that Cash's management didn't think it should be released, and Johnny was leaning in that direction. According to Rick Rubin, it was his daughter, Rosanne Cash, who convinced Johnny to let it go. June died May 15th, 2003, three months after filming, Johnny died September 12, 2003 four months after his wife. Rick Rubin said of the video: “I cried the first time I saw it. If you were moved to that kind of emotion in the course of a two-hour movie, it would be a great accomplishment. To do it in a four-minute music video is shocking. I think the hurt video is a historical document, it's like looking back across a life."" Trent Reznor was sent the video while in the studio with Rage Against the Machine’s Zach De La Rocha, and, when the pair sat down to watch it, any doubts he had about the cover were long gone. “We were in the studio, getting ready to work and I popped it in,” said Reznor. ""Tears started welling up. I realized it wasn't really my song anymore. It just gave me goose bumps up and down my spine. By the end I was really on the verge of tears…there was just dead silence. There was, like, this moist clearing of our throats and then, ‘Uh, okay, let’s get some coffee.' It really, really made sense and I thought what a powerful piece of art. I never got to meet Johnny but I'm happy I contributed the way I did. It felt like a warm hug. It's an unbelievably powerful piece of work. After he passed away I remember feeling saddened, but being honored to have framed the end of his life in something that is very tasteful. For anyone who hasn't seen it, I highly recommend checking it out. I have goose bumps right now thinking about it. Having Johnny Cash, one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time, want to cover your song, that's something that matters to me. It's not so much what other people think, but the fact that this guy felt that it was worthy of interpreting. "" by Cody Flanagan"

TISOA 1173	"God... this song was always great, but the video hits me harder now that I work in Hospice Care. Cash sitting at the full dinner table reminds me of  Mr. Chaphel during his final days, his wife already passed, his kids unwilling to visit him as they lived on the North-East Coast, and his only friends his bottle of Canadian Mist and a newly certified caregiver. It was just me and him sitting at his kitchen table while he told me stories of his time in Korea, his time working offshore drilling for oil, and him opening up his lumber business. He always asked me how do you die, what does it feel like, would he know he was slipping away. He asked me if I thought there was a heaven, whether I thought that after all his stories and antics whether he deserved to go to heaven. I was there when he drew his last breath, his priest praying over him as he left this mortal realm for his eternal reward. 
RIP William ""Billy"" Chaphel

Disco	"Lyrics

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Bence Csóri	My girlfriend broke up with me on saturday. Yesterday I confessed my feelings to her for a restart, but she doesn't feel that right. So here I am after six month with my broken heart, hopes and dreams.
Pyro D	This both saddens me and fills me determination. It’s weird feeling.

Tom C	I grew up in the '60s and '70s. My grandfather would listen to Johnny Cash. He was hard of hearing so he would turn his amplifier up to max volume. I think everyone in the neighborhood would be treated to the show. A lot of time has passed since then but it still seems like yesterday.

simone serenelli	È tutta una bella canzone
B the filmer	This song came on the television in the galley at my first duty station. I can honestly say that just about everyone watching cried at the end. Kind of appreciate it more now as I am getting older and some of the people with me in that moment passed away. Family members died, relationships failed, even myself, I came very close to kicking the bucket a few years ago. So as I reflect on my past and look towards my future, I try to live life without regrets. This song always reminds me of that.
Robert Ellis	One and Only king👑

logmeindog	Unbeatable song. Lots to unpack. I fail to see the relation to Jesus in the video however. Honestly.
mumblety96	I can't even put any song after this on a playlist.   Always deserves a moment of silence and contemplation after listening. profound performance, Mr. Cash.
Bruce Humphrey	"When Reznor was asked if Cash could cover his song, Reznor said he was ""flattered"" but worried that ""the idea sounded a bit gimmicky."" He became a fan of Cash's version, however, once he saw the music video.

I pop the video in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning – different, but every bit as pure"

If any one great man could remember and put his life and soul into one song and video knowing that when the music stops the story ends,

Janice A	"My younger brother has autism and hearing this song the first time he teared up. When I asked him why he was upset do you understand what it's talking about. He said yes and when I asked him to explain he said this:

""We still have to atone for everything before we go. So it doesn't matter if we have regrets or not.""

I never looked at it that way and I listened to it layer on my own and I see where he was coming from."

T. Ommy	"Hurt - Johnny Cash

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Le Poète a aussi bu le fiel de la femelle loup de la solitude dans la Meute de loups incommensurable des steppes des sentiments de l'Âme ! Un torrent de larmes est une cascade d'une incommensurable effusion sentimentale fervente ! Les yeux de l'âme ont des ailes visionnaires qui volent dans la motivation de l'espoir de sentiments vertueux ! L'Hiver rassemble une phalange hyperbolique et homogène d'élégants nuages ​​gris sur le fond horizontal du ciel ! Le Shampooing Nuages ​​Célestes blancs resplendit sous le soleil d'été, dans le cadre céruléen du firmament, parfumant les cheveux telluriques du parfum de la douche estivale particulière ! La Peau est la poésie des vers érotiques du soleil d'été nu ! La Beauté est dans les yeux de l'âme et la laideur est dans les yeux du cœur ! La Poésie ouvre et ferme les fenêtres des dimensions littéraires ! La fleur de cerisier au sommet de sa vie donne le cri de liberté de la nature ! L'Oiseau orange vit dans la transition des saisons, et récite un ping d'accords plombé dans l'orchestre du solstice d'hiver, soucieuse et affectueux dans les relations avec sa famille et ses proches ! Le mariage symphonique de la libido du crapaud et des grenouilles est un orchestre d'orgasmes sensuels proverbiaux ! L'Homme des Mots croit aux sentiments du cœur nouveau qui palpite à la fréquence de la saison de l'amour dans l'âme ! La Verve intellectuelle du mal est une étincelle tardive et terrifiée ! Les Arts sont des manifestations profondes d'expressions précieuses et spontanées, exprimées avec éloquence par les vertus des sentiments de l'âme !

Trey Ramirez	Logan brought me here
The Mechanic	The message he was getting out was live your life and don't do things that will hurt you or cut your life short. Truly a music legend.
Mel Fisher	You never can trust those women.
Joanne Maldonado	I can never make it to the end with dry eyes
Ronzert	Most people don't even know trent reznor wrote this song
TheNewApelles	You can see all of the personal struggles etched in Johnny Cash's face. He was only 71 when he passed, but he looked at least 10 years older.
Concurseiro agro	Algum brasileiro
Michael Esteban Gonzalez Rodriguez	esta canción me pone los pelos de punta <3

Pana_Feo._.	Dude your voice CELESTIAL
Janet Brown	This videio brings me to tears each time I watch it. It has nothing to do with drugs. Johnny beat those demons a long time ago.  He's  reminiscing  about his life, in the autumn  of his life. If we're  lucky we'll all be in the same place he's  at in this video one day.Ya Know, life doesn't  have a rewind button. Live for today !
kelly higgins	This video depicts Johnnys life in some daunting way . I really miss all the old familiar celebrities heck life back then surely was better than these days . Wherever, they are I sure hope its beautiful.. Amen 🖤🙏🏻🖤

Sectum YT	I feel like the deepest part of this video is when he pours his drink on the table full of food.
Felix	Nominated to ”Best stoner music video” on the 420 awards 2020
Robert	Beyond the fame Johnny was the typical Pisces. Pisces is represented by a symbol of  2 fish swimming in opposite directions with tails tied together. Basically Pisces want both lives, family and love, but also freedom from everything. There's a misconception that he's sad about his past because of his decisions but he was sad all along the way and his decisions were made as attempts to find happiness. He did drugs because he was sad to begin with, but it's almost as if pisces manifest their sadness in their minds first and then throughout life live to make sure their manifestation comes true. It's sad. I'm sure there are millions of pisces who can relate to his life

But I remember everything

Cody Cooper	"I was a huge NIN fan, my dad was a huge fan of johnny cash. I remember seeing this video for the first time a couple months before my dad passed away of lung cancer, when I was 18..

This video helped us bond and in some strange way I'd like to believe it might even have brought him some sense of comfort, I dunno... I remember hearing the opening chords and thinking they sounded strangely familiar, then he sang the lyric, ""I hurt myself today..."" I was so excited to share this with my dad..
(RIP dad, love and miss you)
(RIP Cash)"

Judy	"I hurt myself when I just turned 10. Why my Big Sister 13 months older than myself my rock my protecter my other wing passed after a short battle with Leaukimia in my Beautiful Mum's arm's, waiting for an ambulance,  No Morphine, No Painkillers NOTHING. She never ever complained. The Ambulance came she passed. Dad carried her out to the ambulance and to the hospital. I never saw her again I was hiding behind the couch. I lost memory that day, I blocked out Everything..After her funeral mum tried to take her life, something pushed me into mum's room gently pushed my hand under mum's mattress and I found an empty pill bottle. Dad was a licencee of a Hotel then, I ran downstairs  told dad, he called an ambulance, mum was taken to hospital. Me well I was left in the good hands of family friends, all I wanted was to be home with my mum. A few weeks passed I was back home, mum couldn't talk about my big Sister so i couldn't ask any questions, I didn't want to upset her. We moved into another home nothing there just Me alone, I couldn't cry and can't to this day. So when I was alone aged 10 I hurt Myself by promising never to cry again, Never to Remember. I don't cry, but I was left a gift from my Angel my big sister a gift called Empath the ability to feel other Human's feelings thoughts. To protect myself a gift so I could protect myself against Human's..I have come to the conclusion 40% of the Human race are kind Caring soul's 60% are just plain Evil. Yes We all Hurt ourselves in some way. Thank you for this wonderful song. Kindest thoughts from Victoria Australia ""In the Loving arm's of the Angel's beautiful Michelle"" your light will never go out 🕯🕊🦋😇"

He's looking back at his past mistakes (i know its a cover but still) This is an emotional awakening, realizing it was too late for him, because he can't change his past. I'm 32, have made so many mistakes, have some serious hardships, but only self sabotaged . I'm ready to commit to being a better man, so when it's all said in done, my empire won't be dirt. ""If I could start again"" I'll find a way. Good luck to anyone going through depression, addiction, suicidal thoughts, and overall life being shitty sometimes. You are not alone #YNWA"

Vários homens da família Cash estavam entre aqueles que serviram com honra.”

E finaliza: “para quem reivindica a supremacia sobre outros seres humanos, para quem acredita na hierarquia racial ou religiosa: Não somos você. Nosso pai, como pessoa, ícone ou símbolo, não é você. Pedimos que o nome Cash seja mantido longe da ideologia destrutiva e odiosa.”"

Chance Weslowski	Hello.🙂 Today I wanted to share something with you all. Jesus Christ is love. Before you decide to stop reading, hear me out. I, and many others have seen the love of God. He is not just a righteous judge or the one who throws unrepentant sinners in hell. He is love. He wants to save us. He doesn’t desire that anyone go to that place. He is full of mercy and Grace and all he asks is that we come to him and follow him. He is our greatest encourager and provider. Every day is a blessing. Please, never take that for granted. I hope you will come to him and see the truth and live in his new life, prepared for you. God is Good and I hope you will come and see for yourself. Give God a chance and really try to follow him and see his love, peace, and Grace for yourself. God bless you!

Givens Communications	"I still remember the first time I saw this video on MTV3.  I was walking down the hall into the bedroom and heard this familiar voice I recognized from my childhood of many years ago singing this song.

I STOPPED in my tracks; watching and listening to the whole thing.  Johnny looked so broken or ill or something.  Then they showed glimpses of June and she looked like she was on death’s door.  I could not stop watching.  All I could think of was these two don’t have much time left.

When this CD cleaned up at the Grammys, I went out and bought a copy!  This song is my favorite.  

I listened to an interview Rick Ruben did with Terri Gross on her show Fresh Air about 8-9 years ago.  He said when June’s health turned for the worst and she died, Johnny told him to keep him in the studio focused on the music because the pain of thinking about June was so overwhelming.

What a performance he rendered."

Brandon R	The power of the lyrics reznor had its own standing. The power Johnny cash brings to a song had it's own standing. Then nots not forget the video director who pulled together in days a music video that stands against any music video made in the last 35 years. It's simple, shot elequently and brings a powerful undertone. You mix all three of those recipes together and this nothing short of brilliance and a stunning example of how music is used and reach out to touch any and everyone.

Sarah's Song	"Cody Maxwell wrote about when Johnny Cash planned his suicide:
""1967, a man stumbled into Nickajack Cave. He was a man who had made his name rambling around playing a flat-top box and singing about trains and guns and prisons. He sang about loose women, drunken Indians and mad dogs. He sang about shoeshine boys and floods. Chain gangs and men swinging from gallows. Railroads and rivers. He sang about waking up in a Chattanooga jail one morning and said he taught the weeping willow how to cry. He ran with Elvis Presley through the early days of rock ‘n’ roll, singing, ‘I don’t care if I do—die—do—die—do’ from Memphis to New Orleans. He went to sing for the convicts in California’s Folsom Prison He carried his flat-top box up the backstage steps and looked out over a room full of murderers, robbers and thieves. He wore a black suit. He saddled up his guitar the right way, walked out to the microphone and said, “Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.”

But in 1967, the music men in Nashville were saying that the Man in Black was through. He stood six foot two, weighed 150 pounds and had long been strung out on cocaine, pills and booze. Johnny Cash was sick. He had been in and out of hospitals and jails for years and had cancelled countless concerts because he was too wasted to stand on a stage and sing. By the beginning of October that year he was on the edge of death. He had been awake for days and hadn’t eaten anything other than amphetamines by the handful. He was whiskey drunk and strung-out and he knew that his career, as well as his life, was near its end.

He left his home in Hendersonville, Tenn., one day that October and drove east for an hour or so. He parked his old Jeep on the side of the road then staggered through the thorns and brush down to the mouth of Nickajack Cave. He walked into the blackness of that cave until he could walk no more. He then went to his hands and knees and crawled until he couldn’t crawl anymore. Like a sick animal, he was looking for somewhere to die.

We all know of that darkness which was in Johnny Cash—a darkness that is not explained by the preachers on the old gospel radio stations he grew up listening to. This darkness came from somewhere deeper. He told of it in his songs—most famously in “Folsom Prison Blues,” when he sang about shooting a man in Reno, not over a feud over a woman or in a dusty-street duel, but “just to watch him die.” The dark brutality found in “Folsom Prison Blues” doesn’t waste time justifying itself or making sad excuses. It’s not revenge or jealousy—it’s death for death’s sake. It was the Man in Black’s murder ballad side. There’s another ballad in which a woman named Delia is murdered. The killer in that ballad tied Delia to a chair. He shot her once—it didn’t kill her, but “with the second shot she died.”

But there was a catch. There was always this catch in those murder ballads of his. At the end of the songs, Johnny Cash always tells of the guilt the killer later felt. Every time he thinks about that dead man in Reno he hangs his head and cries. When the law finally catches up with Delia’s killer, he’s suffering the jailhouse consequences and pleading for the jailor to come help him, crying that he can’t sleep because all around his jailhouse bed he hears the “patter of Delia’s feet.” The guilt is always there, and that sense of guilt is what made the brutality make sense to all of us.

Johnny Cash had lived on the road for years, traveling and singing his songs about killers and floods, jailhouses and whores. He ate pills to keep running and became “leather and bones,” he said, and there was nothing left of him. He was strung out, wasted and had no idea who he was anymore. He thought that in the black depths of Nickajack Cave he could put an end to his life and nobody would ever find his wasted body. Only God would know where he was and he was ready to let God put him “wherever He puts people like me,” as he said later in his autobiography. That heavy guilt had wholly overcome him and he felt there was no redemption for him anymore. He had no control—death was the only way to make the guilt of what he had become stop. He wanted to be swallowed in the blackness of the Nickajack Cave and of the peaceful blackness of death. He had laid himself down to die.

Then something happened. He later said: I didn’t believe it at first. I felt something very powerful, a sensation of utter peace, clarity and sobriety. I couldn’t understand it. How, after being awake for so long and driving my body so hard and taking so many pills—dozens of them, scores, even hundreds—could I possibly feel all right? The feeling persisted though, and then my mind started focusing on God. There in Nickajack Cave I became conscious of a very clear, simple idea: I was not in charge of my destiny. I was not in charge of my own death. I was going to die at God’s time, not mine.

The Man in Black then raised his head. He started to move. He had no idea how to get back out of the cave but he crawled in whatever direction he could find, feeling before himself with his hands. He soon felt a breath of wind on his back—he turned around and followed that wind until he saw a light.

When he came out of the blackness he found June Carter standing at the mouth of Nickajack Cave. She had a basket of food and gave him something to drink. She held his arm and Johnny told her that God had saved him in that cave. She drove him back home and Johnny told her that he wasn’t going back to what he was before. He had been unable to forgive himself for what he’d become but there in the blackness of Nickajack Cave he realized that God would forgive him.  

The traditional symbolism of the cave tells that those dark spaces beneath the earth are where spiritual death takes place prior to rebirth. Passing through a cave represents a change of state, or a re-entry into the womb, and re-emergence represents that rebirth or spiritual enlightenment. The story of Johnny Cash at Nickajack Cave fits this mythic symbolism perfectly. He entered Nickajack Cave as the Man in Black—strung-out, road-worn and with a deep darkness consuming his soul. He entered that cave as a guilty man but the Man in Black re-emerged forgiven and a Man of God.  

But he still had songs to sing. In his last years, Johnny Cash recorded some old gospel songs. One of those songs seems to tell the tale of what happened to him in the dark depths of Nickajack Cave. As he sang this song there was a new truth in his old voice. It was not the shaky guilt that was there when he sang about tying Delia down or watching that man in Reno die. It was a religious conviction. Johnny didn’t write the song. It’s an old spiritual that tells of the righteous brutality of God rather than of the brutality and guilt that Johnny often sang about—that age old evil guilt that is born into all men:

Well my Goodness Gracious! Let me tell you the news!

My head’s been wet with the midnight dew!

I been down on bended knee

TALK-in’ to the Man from GAL-i-lee

He spoke to me with a voice so sweet

I thought I heard the shuffle of angel’s feet

He called my name and my heart stood still

When he said, “John, go do my will....”

The Man in Black is gone now. Johnny Cash doesn’t play the flat-top box anymore and we can only presume that the guilt that came through all his old murder ballads has been washed away. A dam was built in 1967 and Nickajack Cave was flooded—no one is allowed to go inside. Johnny Cash was one of the last men in there. There’s a fence around the cave’s mouth now. The place is now home to a colony of grey bats that fly out when the sun goes down. When darkness falls and the grey bats fly out the moon rises over the river and moonlight floats on the water. It’s quiet outside the cave at night. There are only the shadows of the mountains, the moonlit river and a soft wind.

Nothing else is there.""

(Cody Maxwell is a Chattanooga writer. This story is adapted from his new book, “Chattanooga Chronicles,”)


To whom it may concern:
If your loved one committed suicide. Don't question why... why God didn't seek them in the darkness of their own cave, and lead them to the Light. Because He may have done that very thing in their final moments... In an eternal sense.
And if you are the one barely hanging on. Jesus is with you now. He is the Light."
Frank Hooker	If you can watch this and not we'll up with tears, you probably aren't human
blackhound rise	"I listen to this and I see my father sitting there looking back at me. This song got Dadness written all over it. The hardships a man goes through and he must still be the Man of his house. Be the Dad. No matter how many mistakes YOU MUST BE THE FATHER AND NEVER GIVE UP.

Now I know one day it will be me sitting there looking back at my son. But I won’t be “there”. I just be sitting and looking back at him."

PaulL _44	This is the best cover song of all time.
guitarprodigy100	I think this song was about him as a Christian and his relationship with God. The ending images of Jesus being nailed to the cross. He is regretting a lot of his life and is hurt that he did things against God. This song, I believe is his apology towards God….at least in the way he covered it.
razorramoan G	he knew it was coming and he wanted to put it into words , our lives are shaped by our experiences , trials , failures , successes , lost loves , hopes and disappointments , but we keep pushing on , and when we finally fill up our U-haul with our empire of dirt , we realize our hearst can't pull it .

Y-tec	"Hurt
 Увеличить шрифт Уменьшить шрифт
Поранил себя
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember, everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

Сегодня я поранил себя, чтобы
Убедиться, что я все еще чувствую.
Я фокусируюсь на боли,
На единственном, что реально.
Игла прокалывает кожу,
Старое хорошо знакомое жало.
Пытаюсь не чувствовать ничего,
Но я помню, все.

Что со мной стало,
Мой дорогой друг?
Все, кого я знаю, покидают
Меня в конце.
И ты могла иметь все это,
Мою империю порока,
Я тебя подведу,
Я позволю тебе страдать,

Я ношу этот терновый венец,
Восседая на троне обманщика.
Полный разбитых мыслей,
Которые я не могу собрать воедино.
На следах, которые время оставляет,
Чувства исчезают.
Ты кто-то другой,
Я все еще нахожусь здесь.

Что со мной стало,
Мой дорогой друг?
Все, кого я знаю, покидают
Меня в конце.
И ты могла иметь все это,
Мою империю порока,
Я тебя подведу,
Я позволю тебе страдать,

Если бы я мог начать все сначала,
За много миль отсюда,
Я бы остался собой,
Я бы нашел свой путь."

Scott Buckler	get right with GOD
Commander Draco	"Society: Men don’t feel pain 

Men:"
chris d	Alcohol isn’t a fair trade for entertainment. But proof that you’re willing to shoot it up rather than drink it says a lot about a person. First of all, they’re crazy. Secondly, they’re right. Smv is all it takes to know but you have to know. And don’t shoot up alcohol into your veins and don’t ask others to do it for you. It’s meant to be absorbed through the digestive system. In a vasculatory system, it’s a bacterial cleanser. Works either way but it’s meant for you to drink, nothing else.
Brad DTW	LISA THE DOLEFUL LET'S GO

Ghostfish	"""Johnny Cash was a drug addict. This song is about his regrets in life. In the 1960s, Johnny was hardly around for his wife and daughters and soon got a divorce due to his non-attendance. He was found nearly dead due to a drug overdose and had lost the most important thing: himself.

Cash's cover of ""hurt"" is about his fame, his family, and his drug abuse. At this point in his life, he realizes he has nothing. His life has been wasted and there isn't anything he can do. He spent all his time chasing fame to make him happy, but it never happened. The only thing he feels is ""the old familiar sting"" of his memories and empty shell of himself.

""Everyone I know
goes away in the end"". He has lost everyone due to his life choices, although he has remarried, his ex-wife, his children, and even his current wife are all different people and grew to be better people in their lifetime, while Johnny has nothing but an empty shell of himself.

""And you could have it all
my empire of dirt"" All of Johnny cash's fame meant nothing. He still is facing the same thing everyone else faces (old age, death, and depression). You could have all of what he had. His talent, his wealth, his popularity, but in the end, it isn't going to mean anything. He still feels empty.

""If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"" Johnny cash wants desperately to live a different life. Away from the drugs. Away from the importance. He wants to live a life where he remembers where his values should lie. Where he's there for his loved ones and himself.

He wants the listeners to know the mistakes he had made and wants us to learn from them. "" -anonymous 

Really good analysis I found online"

Roll Light Puff Pass	"I just wrote this. Its my way of expressing myself. Someting im bad at when it comes to taking. So trying to make it rythm is easier to get it out. What i wrote below needs workbut i just wanted to share it. So please read and if you understand or feel the same then your not alone. 

Where did i go wrong
How do i make it right
Feeling like a failure
Sitting on the sideline
Feeling so distant 
From every person in my life
How can i change that
How can i make it right 

I wake up in the day
Way past lunch time
Im wasting away
Like mountains on the shoreline
I try to pretend
That everythings fine
But im kidding myself
As i age like fine wine 

Negative is active
And theres demons about
Feels like there following
In or out the house
Im hoping for a saviour
Cause i can't save my self
I think i need help
Cause i can't help myself 

All im asking
Is for someone to reach out
And kindly borrow their time
To help me figure this out
There are tears in my eyes
As i write this down
I know ive got a voice
But why can't i shout 

At the end of the day 
When all is said and done
The reality for me is
Ive got a daughter and a son
One aged 2
And one aged 1
So that's the biggest reason
Why i will never run 

When i was little
I remember feeling alone
Abandonment issues
Are ingrained in my dome
How do i shake it
And stop feeling like a joke
I hope one day i wake up
And walk down a new road"

Erin Phelps	"I identify very closely with this cover of “Hurt”. It speaks of the pain and regret that an old man can feel looking back at his life, Johnny had plenty of both. 
It touches my heart the way June looks on at Johnny, she was the only person who could help him quiet his demons. 
I hope someday to find a women who loves me as much as June loved Johnny. Their love was not storybook happily ever after but it was one of the most real love stories of our time."

KidRex15	All of this life led up to this? Alone. Chemically Castrated. Penniless. Friendless. Familess. What was it that I an African American did to deserve this? Righteousness? Forgiveness? False Vengefulness? Greediness? Those that have homes, have cars, have friends, have family, have kids, not allowing one other to have even the basic sense of such? How could no one stop another from continuing what was said to would be brought to an end on Dec 25, 2015?

TorTak	Magnifique
Elvis Presley	It's all vanity..... everything.
Another User	20k dislikes???? How? Why? This song was interpreted by Cash to show an older man coming to the final chapter of his life and looking back. I think he made this song more relevant than the original because it applies to us all, one day we will be entering our final chapter and to that end Johnny Cash has opened this song to everyone, tweaking the sound and changing a few of the lyrics so it can have meaning to us all.  It is a beautifully sad song with real sentiment and meaning.  Listen through those eyes and hear a different song.
Trouble369	Someone needs to make a playlist of all the songs he’s ever made in order from his first song to his last song that’d be dope

Kenyon Heavyrunner	Played this for my mom for her to get sent home... one our best songs to listen together ❤😢 miss u
Integrity Entropy	"This is the same mood Verne Langdon's Carnival of Souls lyrics instill. Stand on the edge of the branch of life, looking back at everything you've done. How in every choice and action you lose some part of yourself you've always taken for granted, and are only able to realize from the perspective of refined wisdom.

With all the suffering in the world, living just isn't hard enough. That is why we bear all the pain and strife of the world at the end of our lives one last ruddy chuckle."

GamePapa	Why do I feel the sudden urge to don a poncho, a revolver, and ride my horse west to avenge the murder of my father?
Bastien Cornu	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Alex Showalter	I understand hurt
Lucas Ruan	Música  linda e triste
Thomas Jones	"Live your life free from addiction...and have the balls to follow through with it while you're young enough to make that decision for yourself or, in my opinion, and my own experience, your dream and whatever you wanted out of your life will disappear in misery just like good old honest Johnny Boy.  The word ""Hurt"" if your an addict ain't a metaphor, it's a reality.  My advice is, don't drag on it.   Fight for your dreams now, get FREE. or it's forever gone....or else as much as you will hate it, you can enjoy the suffering it brings.  Like broke and homeless when your his age.  That's my option, does that sound like yours?"

GADProject Techie	Thank you Cash
Guiseppi Casatelli	"I will forever find myself coming back to this song in my life's darkest moments. 

One of the best songs ever written.  Raw emotion. 

He once visited my high-school but I was not born to see it. My father was and shook the man's hand.  

I remain jealous until the end of time."
Fetus the V	Wtf is he doing with the guitar? Might as well strum it while the background music plays xD
Sky Portal Music	Jesus Loves You
Silvio Silva	Guardiões da galáxia
1ginner1	"""Carpe diem, seize the day"", The great Robin Williams nailed it. Life is for living,  this is not a practice run, If you love her/ him, tell them, what's the worst that can happen?, and if it doesn't ,move on,. In a shit job?, find something you like doing and do that instead. Most people nibble at life, instead take great big bites, sometimes you will fail, that's OK, we all do that, but we can learn from that and move on. That's the trick, if it isn't working, move on. Peace and love."

Alberto Pezzani	Dude, how many things had to happen to have this mastapiece! A great composer had to have a horrible experience to put together these words. A wonderful man had to have a life that suited perfectly these lyrics, and a magnificent team of directors and editors had to put together a killer video. It's just fantastic to witness people doing great things.
todd worthington	it's like Trent wrote this song knowing it was meant for johnny.

Moe Lester	Goosebump
Robert Bozarth	How could you thumbs down this song? Seriously do you have a heart?
Laura Katicich	One of my favorites. Thank you for sharing. His shaky, feeling voice, in his music, reminds me of Roy Orbison's style. They both speak from the heart and painful experience.
che wan saadah c. w. ahmad tajuddin	Logan, You still have time...
epic1	my BFF from kindergarten sadly had to leave us from stress,he still alive just not with us 😔
DuelZ	"Satan brought sin into this world, Jesus paid the price for our sin, Johnny reminding us if he did it 1000 miles away he would find a way. Who was Jesus, “the morning star” who is Satan “the morning star” who gave us sin? “The morning star” who died for it? “The morning star”…
Who’s the biggest star in modern times?
Johnny cash… 
What’s the  root of all evil “money”.
Who was gods perfect angel?"
DuelZ	The symbolism reminds me of eve in the garden and Jesus on the cross and the modern Satan trying to remind you that it was all him all along.
Goose810	This song has so much emotion to it you can feel sadness pain regret and probably even more it always makes me reflect on my life and makes me not wanna take it for granted
Hakuna_Matata	Live life everyday. It’ll pass by before you know it. Enjoy the moments. As my family always says it’s the little things in life that counts. So make them count!

Sylvain Charbonneau	I feel like something stuck in my throat.
Peter	Breaks my Heart everytime i hear the Song :-(. We miss you Johnny :-(.
adonian	when he covers the piano keys, it just feels like he is letting the reaper know he is ready to go.
TheThinkingStone	As a young black kid listening to JC, it truly shows how magnanimous and amazing he was.
Robert Johnson	Appreciate the ppl that you have in your life, before they become the ppl that you HAD in your life.
Janet Duncan	When I learned how this came to be Johnny doing a cover , I thought it was the other way around. This song depicted his life as though he had wrote it.  Sometimes It's a Bitch, by Stevie Nicks was written by Jon Bon Jovi.  People are connected in certain places in this world. Johnny didn't live much longer after he recorded it, so it was like his farewell to the world.
Arminius Hermann	I feel the dislikes are from those lost souls who took their own Iives as they feel the song is a remembrance to those horrible times they remember which was the final moment they realized it was over for them in their mind and all the hate comes pouring out. If only they realize that music is the voice of god trying to save your soul.
A. L.	Leslie chow ❤️
Dale Penner	A song from a man who knew he was a sinner.....BUT also knew that Christ died for him.......and LOVES him anyways.  We are a sinful people who when truly reflecting on life (hopefully sooner than later) realizes that our best deeds are filthy rags in comparison to a perfect God.  In spite of this...God loves us and sent His SON to die for us.  Give your life to Him......your empire of dirt.  He will wash you clean.

Reggae Reggae Horse	I only just learned that Nine Inch Nails wrote this song, for years i thought the Johnny Cash one was the original. Even with this knowledge Cash's is still the most powerful version to me, it can bring me to tears where NIN's version cannot.
Ben Scott	thanks.....,man
Arzu Mammadov	"Coming to the Cross of Jesus Christ. While watching this clip, I can see how all his life passes by in front of his eyes, all that he has achieved and eventually he calls all of it - EMPIRE OF DIRT - because he realizes his sinfulness. ""My sweetest friend"" ""You are someone else"" and final moments of crucifixion in this clip give an idea that in the end of his life he comes to Cross of Christ by seeking redemption and finding THE WAY -  THE RISEN ONE"
Lor Kam	Be honest y’all here from Hangover 😭
Cameron Summers	Damn man 😢 I love this song
Robert Lëwis	RIP my little brother. he died from a brain tumor stage 4 may 20,2020. I cant even express the regrets i have. I tried to keep him alive. I didnt do enough...is my pain I feel everyday and let him down as his big brother to save him. I have my first born son who was born a month before he died. Its the only thing keeping me going.
TwistedSisterX7	"After making this music video, his wife died after 35 years marriage (she was in the video gazing down at him from the stairs)... he died 4 months after her.  All within a year of this video.  So powerful!

... read the wikipedia on the his cover song and video... you'll be blown away.  For example Justin Timberlake got MTV music video of the year, but went to the podium and said Cash deserved it.  Also, it broke records.  Literally nominated as one of the best music videos of all time... in the top list.

Almost 20 years ago, and we are still talking about this video/song... Johnny goes out on top!🙏"

Iron John	Great Song, Johnny lost himself in his life with the alcohol and drug addiction and then he found the Lord and turned his life around however his life was coming to an end with his health fading that no amount of money could buy, hence you can have it all, its all worthless when your health goes, all the money, fame, material things no longer matter. Johnny stepped into a Eternity to be with the Lord and he is now in perfect peace and happiness......as will all Christians be and currently are in Heaven.......
Cold	Bom som mano, descanse em paz.
Stephen Mark	The Nine Inch Nails version of this song is good but Johnny Cash's version is a profound and unsettling masterpiece. The video which accompanies it is also perfect. Life isn't about the junk we collect along the way (the empire of dirt), it is about our relationships with people and the experiences we have. Life is about the journey and not the destination. The journey may be rich, varied, and filled with friendship and love, or it may be dull, meaningless and empty, depending on the choices we make. The ultimate destination is always the same, though some of us get there faster than others.

J Allen	Missing my brother, missing a chat, my big bro x
BC_Hunter	Spent 16 years in addiction. Have lost a handful of friends to drug overdoses, said goodbyes to some on life support. Attended to many funerals. This song is like a dagger in my heart. I can barely watch it as it brings so much pain back….why me.

Grew up with pop in the early 90s, then oasis (still my fav band) done the rap game, Eminem, xhibit, snoop etc, went onto hardcore, Darren styles etc, still love all them types of music, this song just hits in a different way.

danman6669	As of right now, over 20 thousand people have no souls. To thumb this song down, it takes an empty shell of a human.
ryanhdmc	It’s crazy how differently he portrays the self loathing of the original from trent and all it portrays is a man overlooking his life. The original feels spiteful to me, this just feels like acceptance and letting go.
Ashtyn Cliff	This song reminds me of my grandpa that died from cancer he fought so hard

Words cannot describe the man he was, other than “otherworldly” & “family man” to the lifetime of memories shared.

Hyperion	One of the greatest songs of all time. How many do not feel that everyone goes away in the end? I cannot even count how many times I have in the past 10 years. My dad just went away, he was 92 and he reminded me so much of Cash. I get so emotional every time I hear this song. And how many of us would not go back and do it again if we could? So many feel this way, but Cash has immortalized it with this song.

3 Minutes	"The Messiah (Jesus) son of Mary he is not GOD but a messenger,  God almighty can NOT have a human Mother so are they saying the GOD almighty is half Human? Search for the truth ""one message foundation""  here YouTube

Is Jesus GOD ? if your answer is YES then this mean GOD impregnated his own mother virgin marry (not sexual)so he can come out from her?

Even the the bible says

Numbers 23:19
“God is not a man, Nor a son of man, 

Numbers 23:19 New King James Version 
“God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. 
Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?


Exodus 4:22, Luke 3:38,  Psalms 2:7, and Jesus the bible states they are all the GOD first born how many first born does GOD have?   if the bible from GOD definitely will not have any error,  GOD Almighty will not make mistake."

Alexander Gaebel	Don't we all need to kill things from our memories? But this is more a message or hope than disparity
Alysm Tech	20k people disliked this video. Though I have no idea if it is due to the composition of the music or the lyricism or perhaps the message, I just don't know. Maybe they are just disgruntled and I am sure that there is a percentage that mistakenly clicked down instead of up, I just don't know. However, I do know that this song always forces me to reflect. I have served in the military for 10 years. I have served in multiple theaters throughout the world. I have seen both the lowest a man can go, and yet simultaneously the highest a man can be.... I don't understand this world. Sometimes I am quite sickened and I desire to leave it, yet sometimes this world gives me hope. I am continuously conflicted. This song forces me to reflect.
Hank Flitz	I don’t listen to Johnny Cash, but I don’t need to to know that this is clearly the saddest song he’s ever made.
Bob B	This song is sooooo true.. it touches ours hearts.. RIP jonny.. I am 36 but grew up listening to you , thankful my grandmother raised me , I understand this Era of music... RIP mom I love you !!

Jeremy Bernal	The first time I heard this song was the week it came out. I was in Nashville @ BB Kings Blues club. At the time Drunk and in pain. Saw this video and felt I would never be free from drinking. Now with help its been 5 years since I have drank and I still listen to it to remind myself to never drink again.

Feels a lil sad riding by there
Mark Matias	"""I hurt myself today, I fell down the stairs"""
Uygar Kılıç	"Lyrics : 




*I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real


The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything



What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end


And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt



I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair


Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here



What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end


And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way !*"

The times ahead hold tribulations and trials, salvation today for who knows the morrows. 

(Romans 10:9-13) (Ephesians 2:8-10) (1 Corinthians 15:1-4)

Captain Fuckface	"Fucking hell. I really really want to kill myself now. I've been depressive and suicidal for a long time... Listening to this actually helps. It's such a release.  I almost have to seek out the most sad and moving songs to make me lose my shit. That way I get it out of my system, and don't actually do anything drastic.

The NIN version is spectacular, so is the entire album. But the Johnny Cash version of this song is something special."
Alencia	I like the og better but this is amazing too
abdallaha92	"Trent Reznor was 29 when he wrote Hurt. He was a younger man at the time, and his version reflects a young suffering from addiction, depression and never able to living up to expectations.

Johnny Cash was 70 years old, a year away from death, when he covered it. He turned it into a song about lost youth, and lost life. Lines that meant abandonment became lines about the deaths of friends. The final testimont of an absolute legend"

The Amazing Guyulnevrb	I discovered this song as a kid, and was completely unaware that it was a cover until I was an adult. This version, couple with this video, is by far the most profound version of Hurt.
Andrew Bell	I always come back
Amy Kernan	This version of this song... NIN is still fantastic but this particular version is the best. Fallen Pine has a beautiful cover of it as well and it’s so beautifully done. Cash’s take, thought, will always be the most gut wrenching experience.

Different Perspective	"When I watch this video I see that this is his repentance to Jesus it begins with him in the industry going against what was asked of him from God ""you can have it all my empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt"" and towards the end he talks about keeping himself as in his soul and that he would find a way. Just the way I perceive it."
piper.spirit	It's hard to find the words to describe how powerful this song is. The world lost a great musician the day Johnny Cash passed away.
Joanna Hammond	For me this is the best Cash song ever.    Just like Presleys Suspicious Minds.   They seem to create the best at the end.
vercingetorix demir	Muhteşem!
Wretched The	I was a fan of NIN during the late 90s when i first heard this song/version WTF is this but when i have seen the vid man,i think jhonny cash owned it and maybe trent reznor feel the same with it
thewho311	One of the greatest things ive ever heard
Paul	Closing piano looks like he end plays the god's masterpiece.
Eduardo Olbeira	"PROBABLY THE MOST AUTHENTIC SONG I'VE "" EVER"" HEARD!! THERE'S MANY!!! BUT THIS ONE YOU CAN LOOK IN HIS EYES AND SEE INTO ETERNITY!!! I CAN TOTALLY IDENTIFY WITH THIS SONG!!! NO MATTER HOW MUCH ""LOVE"" WE TRY TO SHOW ... (AS MYSELF) WERE LOOKED AT AS OUTCASTS AND MISUNDERSTOOD!!!  ONLY THING I CAN DO IS CONTINUE TO BE MYSELF. AND FORGIVE THOSE WHO NEVER TRIED TO UNDERSTAND ME!!! ACCEPT PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY ARE. . AND WITNESS A ""BETTER WORLD""!!!!!!!! P.E.A.C.E."
TyTimeIsAwesome	I try not to think about it, but one day we will all die and fade into nothingness. Even the memories of us will be forgotten eventually. No one is really unique or special to the universe and its existence. You can be rich or poor. You can be beautiful or ugly. You can be male or female. In the end, it really is just an empire of dirt.

pan dulce	I think his version the song is at first it's apology to himself, then it's a apology for everything he did to everyone else and last part is him trying to say I'm sorry to his wife but he can't quite forgive himself Because he knows the damage he did to her is everlasting

VERIFIED COMMENTARY BY
Rick Rubin

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

Cash’s version of this might be the best song I’ve ever heard. Haunting is perhaps the best word to describe it.

Walter Campbell

I see this piece as a pure evocation of mans deepest dilemma -
he must be bold – be wild – be a beast to control the world but on that path the thing he hoped for is torn to shreds because he becomes one of the beasts out there in the dark that watch for the weakness’s and vulnerabilities of other men – This song is about the trap we are all in – trying to escape that bargain with the world – trying to be human when what to takes to get through to the dream is often wildly dark and cruel even if it is only cruelty done to our own consciousness – it is irreversible – the life is sucked out of us and we can never regain that feeling of wholeness and purity – because the hardness and darkness is inside us now and it means we can never be ourselves again.

The images that the director Romaneck wove into the story of the song are remarkable because they are so wildly true to the sense of the song – the stealing away of a better possibility – the demise of a grander more majestic truth

and the performance captured from Cash – pouring the wine over the table of plenty while his wife watches him from a little balcony – it is mesmerising and full of pathos.

incredible – Trent Reznor split open his consciousness to write this and Rick Rubin understood the relentless cut Reznor made and he stepped inside the wound with him – that single piano pulse is like an atom splitter.

Amazing wild and fearless work.

The fact is, this is a really sad song because it’s a reflection upon his life, in spite of the fact that he did not write it. The pain he feels singing it is evident, and even though he was rich and famous, all of that could not remedy the pain and suffering he went through – there is a certain bitterness expressed towards the world, and himself. Personally I think it’s far better than the Nine Inch Nails version, because the emotions conveyed seem more true and honest, replacing ‘shit’ with ‘thorns’ gives the song a new dimention and finally it sounds good, unlike the Nine Inch Nails version, which sounds like someone with a very bad hangover.

daniel oliveira	Where was the Blue born? In the poetic chemistry of celestial inspiration! Where did the colors come from? From the heart of God! A Where is the winner born? In the hearts of those who always believe in the victory smile! The Blue is born in the victory shout! Henceforth, Blue will be born from the faith invisible tones!   Ich bin Blau Werden, sehr glücklich! Ich bin froh, dass Blau Werden!  The fission of the poetic atom generates an explosion of the intrinsic verses from the soul, and the explosion of the victory smile in the heart! The bridges of the faith of the word unite hearts in eternal bonds of love! The finger on the poetry trigger triggers shoot the verse of wisdom! The Starlight Gardener delivers bouquets of moonlight flowers inspired by the verses open windows of the night  homes for the maidens who dream of living an unforgettable love! The Moonlight  ocean waves are the night embroidery  ornamenting the horizons of the gaze! The words are the poetic guitar of the Man of words, where he strums and makes solos of love verses!  The Book of Love is empty on the pages of the Heart Stories! The heart stage is an anthropophagist and caricatural monologue, and a sentimental theater of false and true characters! The Solitude Castle is built on the architecture of the individualistic plans of the heart! In the deep loneliness of the abyss of the storm of the heart, there is a glimpse of the rupture of thought!  The eclipse of thought happens in the interception of the sun of hope on the heart horizon! The human being is a slave to his thoughts! The consequences are the embryo, the seed and the harvest of shadows and lights from good and bad attitudes! The human numeral is an indecipherable equation through thereason thoughts!  The Algebra Angel calculates the human numeral! The harshness of days and the adversities of time, make  feelings hostage to insensitivity! The Forgetfulness is one of antidotes in the true process of repentance! The paradise of economic ciphers only buy the ephemeral things in life! If the poetic alligator spoke, It would pronounce the eloquent speech of atrocious and cutting words! The Moon is pregnant through the poet's dreamy poetry! Robeen Westt took off his poetic mask to the light of reason's glowing glabrous chandeliers, and revealed and proved to be a friend of John Doe's noble causes, John Nobody!  The rain is the sincere expression of the sky of tears firmament clouds!  The rain is the genuine heavenly manifestation of the clouds of the sky! The malemolence of  maleficence and backbiting is not in the balance of the accentuation of the lie around  and the wiggling of the dance of the curves of the retractances and recesses  and in poetic ballet of the feminine body lines, but in the irascible violence of the  reticences of the shameless heart, and in the eyes of impudicity!  The invisible seed of faith is born among the rivers of the truth of the feelings of the soul's heart!  The listlessness slander is not in the swing of the accentuation of the hump and waddle dance of deeps  verses curves , and the poetic sensual ballet of the female body traits, but in the uncontrollable ferocity of the shameless heart suspension points, and the foulness eyes!   The poetic bowsman launches the boleadeas to hold strong the brave of the thoughts of the heart! The Paratroopers Jump Poetics jump inexorably behind the lines of defense of the heart !! The filters and strainers of the percolator words coupled in the cullender thoughts promote the process of analysis and scrutiny of all the contents in the heart! The Propaganda works from the outside to the inside and from the inside out on the soul vision billboards! The rooster is the onomatopoeic harebell at dawn house of the morning; and who said that the animals company does not listen to the star symphony! Pump money into the financial coffers driven by greedy cleft is the root of all evil! The Love is the brotherhood of the virtues of the soul's feelings! The city mermaid woman comes out of the adjective ocean, adorned with shining compliments and showing her paradisiacal beauty! Hiding the truth is the favorite game of darkness! The darkness of the night and the opportunities designed and planned it is the robber's garment and the soul thief steals the souls that are in the attitudes of the darkness of the heart and practices dark behavior in the darkness of the heart! The poet does not laugh at life, much less life laughs at the poet! The body asks for and demands physical exercises from the moment that the body cultivates with dedication and disciplines the physical exercises! Behavioral composure is the correct posture to be obtained! There is no defeat for the faith!  The invisible seed of faith was born among the confluences of the rivers of truth of the feelings of the soul's heart! The poetic Looper is a flying ball of verses that becomes a hitting streak when falling out of the reach of the internal players of the literary composition! The floating ballerinas of the stars inspiration dance brilliant ballet in the petal of the equilibrium of suavity and softness on the tip of the toes of the verses of the performance! Today's Lie is the eternal headstone without tomorrow! Injecting money into the coffers of finance with a craving for greed is the root of all ills!  For women Formula One pilots of life, men's ears are their favorite cookpit! Self-motivation needs to be pulled and powered by fighter jet engines to fly the flight of inspiration! The Words are faithful witnesses to the decay of the heart!  The Envy is the reflection and meditation of evil! The mathematics of love has the perfect measure to unite the hearts that love each other, despite the distances that separate them!  The Sun has the infallible originality to publish the day light;   and the Moon has the infallible originality to illuminate the Poet's heart! The Heart does not want the armistice in the war of feelings! War and Peace play chess on the board of trenches and barricades in the heart! The poet was not always alert to achieve the verses of the world Jambo, however was always alert to not atrophy the mind in uniform of slutty and sarcasm of idiots! Who can distinguish the essences from the tears, and who knows and can measure the depth of a tear? The whole height of the attitudes provokes an action that generates a mathematical proportion of the impact of the consequence reaction! The Bitterness and heartache steal the plumb of reason's stability!  The Way of life is interwoven in countless Way! The Alcohol Autopsy reveals the sensation of the miraculous asp! There is an endless war with the Forbesco Indian of the curare zarabatana blowgun of the illusions of life! The Revanche only makes sense when it springs from the desire for rehabilitation! The helmsman of the taverns holds with the muscles of faith and with his peculiar pride the ship's ballast rope in the oceanic storm ! When the goalkeeper conquers in his soul the determination to defend the penalty, he grows in the dimension of the mountains on the horizon of life! Looking at a woman is a delight, but looking at the truth is an eternal delight! The Prestige, sometimes, depends on the hypocrisy of others! The Laws of Physics do not exist in Chinese martial arts films, and which they are undoubtedly excellent,  the only one who actually did this was Jesus Christ!!! The Rain is the sincere heavenly expression of the clouds of the firmament!  The Rain is the glossary of tears from the adventures and misfortunes of heaven! The blue princess has a lioness smile in the orchestral heat! JJJSSS

Because of this, we can be sure that everything that is had to be made where there was absolutely nothing to make it out of.  Romans 1:20 New International Version For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. So you see, there is a God. I myself have studied world religions in depth in college and much more so on my own time. I have found that the only religion that holds water is Christianity. I am no affiliate of any Christian denomination as they are called because the enemy has a very well received counterfeit in place in nearly all of them, and the condition is terminal. I am Messianic, where I find Truth to be most rightly applied and followed. The bill of rights we share is such a blessing. But I will quote TobyMcKeehan with Times are changing/With morals in decay/Human rights have made the wrong okay. I am only showing you the way as I have found it  through much study and life experience. Perhaps my best case for Truth of this is found in the book of Habakkuk 1-2:17 where he was given a vision of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. Some very strong and interesting proof is in the discovery of Sodom and Gomorrah. This is in these videos. Pt. 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QsgY115EFc Pt. 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8plh4NMoQs8 And here is where the remais of pharoes army is found in the red sea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3NuAkXUwu0   Gnesis 19:24 New International Version Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah--from the LORD out of the heavens. Brimstone found there is over 95 percent pure. The purest sulfer anywhere else is just over 45% and is found near active geothermal regions. Brimstone such as is found near these two infamous cities is found nowhere else on earth. Yet here it is still, a God-given supernatural element to warn those who would live against Him.  2 Peter 2:6 If He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, reducing them to ashes as an example of what is coming on the ungodly; He is love or He wouldn't have warned us. Here are two of the videos I found on this.

Bruno Spinelli	How many memories, how much feeling, in Argentina there are several of us who love you, with respect, Osvaldo.-
pharcyde	The saddest people I've ever met in life are the ones who don't care deeply about anything at all. Passion and satisfaction go hand in hand, and without them, any happiness is only temporary, because there's nothing to make it last

Russe France	This was the credit song on the movie Columbiana. It touched me so much I had to find out more. Of course, Johnny...
nghost1	Best cover ever.  But on a personal level I still prefer the Nine Inch Nails version but that's tied to a personal story.  A good friend died due to complications from drug use.  He'd listen to the Reznor version over and over saying it was the anthem of his life.  We played this for him in the hospital as he took his last breaths in the world.  He kept several of us in our little group from trying drugs but he could never beat his own demons.  I think he'd have loved this cover

Вадим Табаков	Можно умирать под эту песню... И это прекрасно! Готов слушать её бесконечно.
Angelina Robert	Johnny Cash is his old age reminds me of my dad. RIP. An old man with a handful of regrets. Only cause I got a Mitochondrial Disease did I stop drinking. It saved me from following in my father's footsteps. I have fewer regrets and am still married. But my wife sometimes hurts herself. I'd like to know why so I can prevent her from hurting herself again.
Pamela	"Listen too the words closely, the message is clear. 
The song is about how he let his wife down, and Jesus, it’s a song of regret of the things he did bad, the message is clear."
Andy	"i heard this on the Logan Trailer ""the last wolverines movie on the X-Men Saga"", its a good death song"
drewyn tewliss	The only people who mourn him are those who never met him a despicable individual.
David Schmidt	"As ""sad"" as this song can be, I use the idea that America could produce such a strong soul, born on a dirt road, who developed himself, who stumbled, in true human fashion and who suffered the punishment, and who chronicled it all, and persevered, and rose above and ultimately triumphed.... to keep me going. 
     I've always respected and enjoyed this man's work, and I grew up listening to his songs on the .45s that my dad bought. Even as a kid I knew there was just something different and 'special' about this guy...there was just something in his voice that I could never pin down but that always hit me deep inside. But then I grew up, and went a different way, but in HIS later years, he somehow  became more stripped-down and more down-to-Earth...which somehow made him even MORE real and accessible....and I found him again.
RIP Johnny Cash    Truly one of the greatest AMERICAN artists who ever lived."
MadMax MFP 4703	God Bless , see you on the other side👍

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

ronan mooney	How can anybody put a thumbs down to this? Idiots
Mickey Mouse	My take on this is Mr. Cash, lived a hard and fast life,  he as many can relate to what we have to face before we leave this earth. For me this is a hurt, I experienced as a child, and as, I was growing up, I swore, I would never let anyone hurt me. In that process, I didn't allow myself to feel... Using Alcohol and weed became my way to numb the hurt.  As he sings the first words..I cut myself, today... because that's what some people do, as to see if they have stopped the hurt! However, what happens is you lose the love ones, and can be successful, but inside your dead.. when the hurt is dealt with and the pain can be felt, but not to go back but to move forward, then you are able to finally be at peace..

Ziggy Marie	"I dedicate this song to my grandmother......who at 93, lifting her in and out of her wheelchair, throwing out my back every day, wiping her butt, changing her diaper, pee or poop, showering her, loving her, feeding her what I cook, and what I remake her cause she doesn't like it, constantly asking her if she's hungry, thirsty, warm enough/cool enough, pillow firm enough,....never loving or appreciating me...no matter what...getting up with her every hour, on the hour all night to remind her where she was, or why she's here....spending more time with her than i do my own children, cause I never want her to feel alone or isolated, catering to her every need,.... but she still hates me....and forever will, and when we had to finally admit her into the hospital today, she told all the doctors, nurses, and social workers that i was ""abusing"" her, just so she could go back home..where nobody is there to care for her,...I'll never recover from this lost cause, that I would never, ever, be good enough for...""Hurt""
What's wrong with me? Why am I so undesirable, so vile, so unlovable....as much as my huge broken heart can love, why can I receive no love in return?..."

Mark Kidman	"Johnny Cash managed to accomplish the near-impossible. Create a cover that not only remains true to the original but at the same time put his personal take on it. This is one of my top 3 covers of all time. 
In no order:
-Hurt, Johnny Cash
-We can work it out, Stevie Wonder
-Killing me softly, The Fugees."
Woody boy	Who ever dislikes this don't truly understand pain.
Kenneth Williams	Trent Reznor is an amazing lyricist. Brought to an even higher level when sung with the voice of Cash. One of the best covers I've ever heard. 2nd best to be exact.

Jay Best	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here"

Bobby Jan	U know, Mr Cash, if u ever read this; i feel your pain. You are an example for expressing it. Beyond the pain there is reflection. A release to be found. The pain is only temporary once you've found an escape; whether in addiction or in redemption... thank you <3

Lucas Mendes	Jhony cash monstro sagrado
Josiah Cain	Cash for most of his life was a joyful man who enjoyed his music, was close to his faith, but most of all loved his family. When his second wife June Carter died and all he had was his music, Cash continued to work despite his painful diabetic condition. In the end, when he died, Cash left behind enough songs for one more album release but his career wasn't anything that could support his family after his death and his children aren't well known and ultimately had to make their own careers to survive. The song fits well with Cash's later life as he felt pain, only continued on because of his work, and left little behind except for his children. I love Johnny Cash's music and it's sad that he's gone. If you want to pay respect to him and his legacy, look into the work of his children and keep listening to his songs.

Prat	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Made me reflect on some choices I regret. Rest easy Mr. Cash

OMAR FERNANDO BOLANOS DELGADO	No debí hacer eso.
sherry0079	So beautiful. The look on June's face and the footage, magnificent. She died not long after this and then Johnny Cash followed.
DomTheBomb	One of the best songs about life right here 🙌
Andrew Adams	Listening to this beautiful song is i have been there, drugs and drink, my husband died 1 7th April and he died of cancer and 6weeks i had him home and he died at home with me 💔 had this at his funeral 💔 breaks my heart, all he wanted to do was start again 💔💔🙏💯
Mister Ree	I always sing ''What have I become, my Swedish friend.''
Muhammad Yasir	"There's something turbulent and different when the piano's notes start to ascend in the song ..
it's almost like a sense of urgency, a warning .. maybe Cash is telling others to live life to the fullest before it fades away forever"
SaintMace	"Reznor said he was ""flattered"" but worried that ""the idea sounded a bit gimmicky."" He became a fan of Cash's version, however, once he saw the music video.

I pop the video in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning – different, but every bit as pure."
TheStrmcliffae46	RIP Johnny Cash you were amazing
Literally Satan	Mental breakdown time 🤪
Evan Faust	"This was Johnny’s swan song.

The swan song of the greatest musician of all time."
M. Josef Wolfe	I, like so many others just had to learn to play this song. Reznor and Cash... what an amazing collaboration.
Shakir Smith	The disagreeable chicory phenomenologically preach because felony dfly tease between a living battle. shaggy, spiffy theory
Atlanta Northcutt	"This song always makes me cry because I played it for my mom as she drove me to rehab.
It felt like the only way I knew how to begin to apologize because there were no words I could physically speak that would express my gratitude for her never giving up on me, continuing to love me at my worst, and knowing how much I had hurt her with my actions while in active addiction.
I wouldn’t wish addiction on anyone. The guilt, depression, suicidal thoughts, lies, selfishness to those who never gave up on me. I hated myself so I would get high all over again and continue to repeat the cycle.
I’m so glad I never have to lie to or worry my mom or myself anymore.
Tough song, man."
Bedtime Stories	Cash's version of this song is great, but the old footage interspersed throughout the video just enhances the meaning and pushes it over the top. Like life flashing before his eyes in his final days.
Emmanuel Botello	This song and how Johnny performs it takes music to the next deep level, much more profound feelings than NIN's, it's all because he is singing in the most sincere way possible
Zuhan Mohammed	This song suits Logan so much
The Metal Mag	great

Ivan Guban	I don’t know why, but I can’t stop crying.
WhileMyGuineaPigGentlyWheeks	This is one of those songs that are just so moving. It’s Hauntingly Beautiful, Eery in a beautiful way I guess you could say. It really gets you thinking about Life & Death in General. Rest In Peace, Johnny Cash. I Love His Music. Life is precious. And I just want to say, I send my love out to you all. I Hope You All have a blessed Life & That Love follows you. I Personally Think Love is the most important thing in Life, and so I am sending my love to anyone who’s reading this. Life is precious, don’t take it for granted. Sending Love ❤️
Saint James	"Luke 9:23-25
And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. 
For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. 
For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?"
c l o u d	this is the most depressing song ever
Chris Regan	I cry every time I listen to this. My favorite part about this isn’t even just the song, but the fact that Johnny Cash was listening to Nine Inch Nails is cool as shit.
Bud Weiser	i care to much  and thats my down fall ...and if it was back in the day with no internet  they would be lost   not  knowing how to survive
Wikeizando	maravilhosa canção
StankB0mb	"I cannot listen to this without thinking about Trent Reznor's reaction to first hearing/seeing this cover:

""I pop the video in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. Like I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone.  Then that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning – different, but every bit as pure.""

What an honor for a musician to have Johnny Cash bring so much depth to it by retrospectively reimagining his entire career through the lyrics, on his practical deathbed no less.  That's an artistic validation people search for their whole career."
Sock Owe	Jesus CHRIST!!! This song is SO DAMN AWESOME!!!
adrew martin CD	Quem cañta sempŕe encanta

RenildoJr	My favorite song of all time. When I first heard it (fan-made Last of Us trailer) I went completely crazy ‘cause I couldn’t speak a word of English and didn’t know how to search for it. Spent weeks on forums looking until I finally found out the name of the song. Been a fan ever since

László Kezi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqaPaL21syA
David Palmer	Any pain and destructive behavior anyone goes through in life, drugs, alcohol, vices, etc., are caused by themselves. If you had  a shitty childhood, shitty abusive parents, it certainly sets you up for these things you can do to destroy yourself, but some of us had inner strength and vowed we wouldn't hate and punish ourselves because life wasn't fair. I feel the least compassion for people who gained fame and wealth, then chose to destroy themselves from the inside out. Don't count on other people for compassion, it starts from within. At the very least, don't hate yourself... life will be less torturous, and maybe, just maybe... quite enjoyable.
Rob Ashton	"I remember Johnny Cash playing at Glastonbury in '94. He was up on Sunday in between various indie rock bands and he said later that it was the first time in thirty years he'd been worried about how he'd be recieved. He needn't have been. All it took was ""Hi. I'm Johnny Cash"" and he had us. The man was effortlessly cool.
 He did an interview for TV after he'd played, and he was asked what he thought of the festival. 
 ""Well, these young people, they ain't...they ain't like me. But they're doing their thing. An' that's cool. Their havin' fun and they ain't hurtin' anyone."" 
 Total legend."
Ryan	"Gave me ""Logan vibes"""
mr del	Everybody hurts thanks Johnny cash a legend love this song

HoneyBadgerUSA	Did he alone? I know his wife died several months before he passed. Did he have family with him until he died. This song got me so choked up and with the feeling that he didnt have anyone.
Sokar	"Think of it. In the endless noise of ""modern music"", these are the murmurs of a paste that had a soul.

We have lost our way. All of us. We use to aim for the stars, and now we are dominated by the simplest of society. Where we once had hope of progress, love and community, we now have despair 
and victimhood. I pray, even though I'm an atheist, for the recovery of American, and the guardianship of the west they use to represent. The world will be a darker, and a lesser place if you don't recover. Love Denmark."

Corrina	Seriously I don’t mean to be cliche to say this but who gives this a thumbs down? An old man singing about losing his loved ones. A song of loss and sorrow. Johnny Cash once asked “what is truth?” - here it is.

zeke garza III	Rest in peace Johnny you left a legacy behind.
Baden Claassens	sometimes listening to the depths is enough. If you have tasted the path then you can emphasize with the message. If you swallowed the pill and ate the sunrise until your early demise we understand
Kirk Lockwood	https://youtu.be/AN-CFnII4Z0
Tim Poole	The most powerful music video I have ever seen.
floating away	rest in peace
The Mad Machinist	This song helped me in my battle against depression. Knowing I wasn't alone meant a lot. Listening to it now, over a decade later takes me to a dark place. I think that's a good thing. It takes a taste of dark to appreciate the light I think.  Once you've looked into the void of suicide and turned back you realize life is precious. In its glory and its pain.  Knowing that level of darkness is in you keeps you focused. If anyone out there relates to this song the way that I do I only have one thing to say. I love you and yes life is worth the fight.  Don't stop fighting.
Paper Princess	There are no words... Thank you Johnny Cash and your beautiful wife and her family and everyone for all the music
Jan-Wolfgang Artur Bütow	UNTOUCHABLE
Pedro Alves	This is the greatest music video of all time.
damian anguiano	We have all been through this. At one point .
Mrinal Kaushik	"hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Ino Stiv	Only one - THANK YOU... 💖
TimeandMonotony	He took a great song and made it a masterpiece.
Jake Stewart	"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.
 
1. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
2. Do you think there is an afterlife? 
3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? 
4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?
 
I'm definitely not good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness: 
 
1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? 
2. Have you ever stolen? 
3. Have you ever used God's name in vain?
4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? 
5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? 
6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?
 
The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell? 
 
2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus' death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. 
 
What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, ""No one is good — except God alone"" (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. 
 
When are you going to do that?

King of Thorns	The greatest cover of all time. Rest in Peace, man in black.
steven klopatek	I think everyone can relate to this son sung by someone who felt both tragedy and elation. Johnny Cash is as American as George Washington. The man embodied all of the feelings and spirit of America. June knew the beauty of a man with passion and my hat is off to her.

Uriel Hans	"Bleed for the stars
Dreams of a world that's ours 
It's all mine
One of my greatest lies
The moment the music fades
What have I become
Another broken note
Fading away
Lost in a vision of lies
Wasting my time
In the end
No goodbyes
One step away from paradise
I just close my eyes
Shout another prayer to the sky
I can't find my peace of mind
As I watch it all
Fall apart
Dust to dust
In God we Trust
Just another tin man
Built to rust
Lay my grave
In the twisted thorns
I felt the world pause
For a moment 
I heard death call
On The pursuit 
Of lustful pride
Greed to hide
The lies
Wayward soul
Searching for my eternal home
Dear lord
Would you free my soul"

Warrior-for- God-of-Israel	"I am so completely overwhelmed, by the combination of the video as well as the song. I have been clean for 37 years, from drugs and alcohol, and the struggle is real, always some well-meaning person offering ""just a little..."" whatever that little bit is, it guaranteed to empower Satan, and a stepping away from the real and saving grace of Jesus keeping me on the right, clean, path."

S.M	I have been listening to this song since I found myself hooked into Dante and Beatrice 's story and of Virgil's poetic methods and  my mind just so wandering about things and my life now. I am so back to my old self who always listen to theatricals dripping soul into the realm of the early centuries. I don't know who hears me out with all my poetic soul too. But whenever I joined this line together with classical music and as those of Mozart's, just so so. I feel great listening to these kind of stuffs.❤
paul waul	now you back with her Jonny
James Bodziony	This song shows how everything you try to get on earth will all be worth nothing in the end when you die and go to heaven it will all be vanity, so spend your life doing something that will matter when you go to heaven by helping others and caring about the world then trying to have it all.
Victor Perez	Well...Youtube is closing the comments of this videos...sad

HEAVENLY	I hope I am happy to leave.

Every one of us can relate to it to some extent or even fully. It makes me think of my life, my deeds, my sins... total cleansing.

I, I'm grateful to be able to  experience Johnny's music with all heavy baggage it comes with. Great Man, Great Musician. Long may live his music in our hearts!"

John Carmody	Johnny the g.o.a.t of country music. His career starts with rock and roll and gospel veers towards folk and then country and then alternative. His soul was in every genre he sang. He wore his heart on his sleeve when it came to the poor, the imprisoned, the marginalized, the addicted. A flawed hero but a hero and role model none the less. R.I.P. Mr Cash, I hope you found the peace you always deserved.
Sepp BARBETTA	I like this song...Greetings from Luxembourg :-)
Marco Arvin Modestini	How the fuck someone can put dislike to this? Fuck troll, respect for Cash. The shit he’d trough by you cannot judge. Go away listening your fucking Justin Bieber Holy God!
Mr. Haze & Cherish Hils	"I love this just because the pain I feel is exactly how he describes it.

It’s like I’m doing harm to myself just for pleasure or because I’m not good enough and in the end the only thing that’s real is the pain. The pain I can feel and I can’t compare it to anything else. Nothing touches me more than this pain. 
I am lost and I will probably die soon, but that’s ok, because living is hurting me more than dying."

daniel oliveira	The Modernity does not buy the flavor of the fish of life! The Freedom is independent thinking from the dark empire! The Desire and distorted pleasure is a country that has no border with heaven! Erotic brainwashing is in the activities of the visual underworld! The Guilt is the bridge of the suicide's gasp! The clocks walk, at dawn, with footsteps and footprints heavier and deeper than the night! The Thought unfastens and unbutton the behavior of the decadence's interior wardrobes! The Paper tears only tell superficial stories! The Night is the alibi of the Man of words and the stars are accomplices of his immortal love for the blue Princess, in the diaspora of the outcasts! The country of autumn has brilliant nights that illuminate the butter-colored mountains with the splendor of the constellations! The Philosopher loves wisdom, however, he became unfaithful and espoused madness! The crazy Libido of passion shatters the heart! Lie will always be a substrate of darkness! The Castle of Reason has a moat and deep labyrinths around it, in which the intellectual and erudite thoughts of reflection pass through, and are related to! The Castle of Reason has a moat deep and labyrinths in its surroundings, in which it transits, and relates the intellectual and erudite thoughts of meditation! The Wine is the supreme idyllic essence, and the telluric poetry of the arteries of the vines!  The Philharmonic of the human organs is a perfect orchestra tuned to the tone of heavenly music! ! Is The Poetry the beautiful aesthetic with a depth of literature, or the melancholy revolt of the soul? How many doors does the thought have? The roaring bonfire of criticism is a deep throat of words! The outfit highlights and accentuates the deep sonnet of female anatomy! The expression of the rainy gaze reveals the nuances and shade of the winter season of the soul! The eternal sentence of the sepulchral tacit epilogue is the resounding apotheosis of posthumous lips! The poet's First Nature is in crisis of existential identity, because he cannot take life's verses anymore! The Man of the Words put on of the Überzeugung soldier in the war for the heavenly immortal soul! In the game of positions, the thoughts simmer boil! The erotic and sensual gravitational shield breaks the barriers of bodily manifestations! The Poet has the diploma of tears, because it overflows the river of the soul's feelings! The Goal within the rules, justifies justice in a football match, because it is the supreme eminence! The poetic congruence is the harmonious conjunction of the verses in line with the coherence of the conscience! The verses of the eyes are the poetry of the soul in color! The heroine of the violet mask of desires inflame he tthoughts of the heart with burning hallucinations of virgins chimeras! Do not postpone,  and do not prorogue  the readings of love in the feelings of the heart, because hatred is the ego of evil, and life passes quickly, and the night comes with stars and without stars in life! The Palace of the Blue Moonlight was built with fictional architecture at the end of the horizon of poetry! The eyes of the heart do not see hope when thoughts are in the dark! The Nose is the facial sculpture that suffers the persecution of the soul imperfection! The Purity is the flag and labarus of the sanctuary of the temple of the soul tabernacle! The Man of thw Look  wept in the port that lacked fear and inspiration! The Poet has the poem written on the skin clinker of the soul with the lavas of the celestial volcano! The Flowers of the garden of lucidity fade in the sun of time! The tumultuous Flames of thoughts ignite the fire of suffering in the soul! I lived a life in 1one minute thinking, however, I lived life without thinking! I lived a life in a minute thinking, but when I lived life I didn't think!  The Poetic rubber ducks do not sink into the deep waters of life verses! When thoughts are erected on the chantry of materialistic conglomerates, the soul feels the Mist of death's death algidity! The Heavenly Carpenter builds charity houses with clapboard of the attitudes of love, in people's hearts! The Firmament is a chafariz fountain of planetary lights decorating the universe of poetic inspiration! The Thought is the bridge for the utopian communities of the future! Only a sun shines on the elegiac night of death JJJ SSS

RAIDEN	"Lyrics

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"
Angela Vaughan	Legend.

Kay Hughes	The longing bead postauricularly kill because spandex spectroscopically lock beside a thoughtless snowman. bumpy, noiseless downtown
Starpartyguy	This is a song that totally slipped my attention until Deadliest Catch played it as a tribute to Phil Harris. To be honest, I didn’t even recognize the voice because I was so affected by the emotion of the situation and the song. When I realized it was Johnny Cash, I realized it was his confession.

Taha iftikhar Needs attention	Everyone he knows going away is his loved ones dying, the feeling that goes away means you get numb over time, him hurting you is him dying, his empire of dirt is all his loved ones being dead theres still things i dont under stand like crown of thorns in a liars chair full of broken thoughts i cannot repair and you are someone else i am still right here and him hurting himself to see if he still feels

Joe Greene	I lived within walking distance to his home in Tennessee.The front faced the street and had a guard shack that was never occupied. The rear of his house was on the river. I saw him checking the mail one day and I waved. He waved back while looking at his mail. I never appreciated it. I was young. I am 50 now. Things are different.

Erik Truchinskas	"Ugh this makes me miss my grandpa, he was an amazing person a true ubermensch. He was bedridden his last 6 months and wouldn't let anyone change him but me and he would break down crying and apologize for having to be taken care of. I used to tell him that he changed my diapers when I was little so I'm just repaying the favor. On his last day I was going to the gun show and for some reason I didn't feel right going and I kept asking him ""are you sure you will be alright for a couple hours?"" And he just smiled and said ""I'm not an invalid, go have fun"". I gave him and big hug and a kiss and left. When I got back he was in the process of dying. He was just conscious enough to nod when I asked him if he was alright. He was a tough sonofabitch it took him almost 12 hours to shuffle off the mortal coil. I can't wait to see him someday"

Gammer Man	Johnny Cash, the man in black. The man who represented everyone, the poor, the old, and the tired. It’s rare to find singers who can sing with as much meaning and soul as Cash did. It’s Cash when I need to get rhythm. It’s cash when I need to be reminded of that ragged old flag. It’s cash when I need a place to reflect, cry and laugh.

A very deep sadness came over me and I told my (then) husband, and his brother, that Johnny would be dead in 6 months... 6 months later June died and about 6 months after her Johnny passed...

My brother-in-law said I thought you said Johnny would in 6 months. I looked at him and said, if you stop and think about it...When June died, so did Johnny.

Rest In Peace, June and Johnny. You are missed."

Gi_Palu	"mi sono fatto male oggi
Per vedere se mi sento ancora
Mi concentro sul dolore
L'unica cosa che è vera
L'ago fa un buco
Il vecchio e familiare pungiglione
Prova a uccidere tutto
Ma ricordo tutto
Che cosa sono diventato
Il mio più dolce amico
Tutti quelli che conosco se ne vanno
Alla fine
E potresti avere tutto
Il mio impero di sporcizia
Ti deluderò
Ti farò soffrire
Indosso questa corona di spine
Sulla sedia del mio bugiardo
Pieno di pensieri spezzati
Non posso riparare
Sotto le macchie del tempo
I sentimenti scompaiono
Sei qualcun altro
Sono ancora qui
Che cosa sono diventato
Il mio più dolce amico
Tutti quelli che conosco se ne vanno
Alla fine
E potresti avere tutto
Il mio impero di sporcizia
Ti deluderò
Ti farò soffrire
Se potessi ricominciare
A un milione di miglia di distanza
Mi terrò
voglio trovare un modo

Virginia Just	This song is sad, but I take some comfort in how old he is in this video. Lots of great musicians didn't make it that far. Curse of 27 and such.(Joplin, Hendricks and Morrison) At least he found a way to make it to an old age. He also had his girl by his side. In the world of famous musicians, Cash did well over all. Here's to you the man in black! I drink a beer in your honor!!!!!

Slev	"Cash definitely did a better job at making the song about himself like the selfish junkie he was :D At some time i liked both songs but the more you listen to them you just hear how bland and lame cash is, it's not emotially sad it's just depressingly bad. A already good song with alot of emotion that he just stole and stepped on. cash ver got no lyrical value, he's just singing a stolen song and sobbing about his ""ohh so sad life"". The ONLY reason this ver became big was because of pop culture AND ofc becasue it's a really good song already. he just stole it and took the credit because in pop culture that's ok because we got so many little fb/twitter tards like the comment section here ^^"

CrypticMaster	This song always makes me think of my father. He was a mechanic and owned his own shop for 40+ years. He had 11 kids, 5 boys and 6 girls. I am one of the boys, second youngest of the bunch with a younger sister. He got Parkinson's and slowly fell apart. I was away at college when he died and besides my younger sister and my mother ever one else was gone when he died. His legacy crumbled around him as he slowly decayed, my mother lost the house and garage he had worked for for so long and now nothing is left of his legacy. When he died everything got taken away. Thinking about how he died while I and so many of my other siblings were gone... this song always makes me realize how lonely his ending must have been.
Stephen Weiss	Everyone can apply this to themselves differently and equally valid, but for just me, and maybe for Johnny if I get his video right, behind all the ones we hurt by our selfish sins, the One behind them all that is ultimately hurt is Christ on the Cross, and yet also as our ultimate sweetest friend, out of love for us He willingly takes it all, all the hurt we both dished out and received over the course of this broken life, this empire of dirt, and in so doing, He atones for it all too, erasing it all, expiating it....redeeming and recreating us anew in the end by assuming all that destructive hurt as His own.

Ryan Byrne	"Most people don't really get what this song is getting at.  It's about relapse.
Quitting drugs is hard enough, trust me, I've been through years of addiction to heroin and other drugs.  But the worst part, and why most people end up relapsing is because as you start to move on from the addict lifestyle of lying and stealing from everyone in you're life, you start feeling major guilt about all the things you've done to them to support your habit.  Once that feeling hits its tough to keep going, and very easy to slip back to what you're used to so the guilt will go away.
No matter how many times people will say they forgive you, or they're proud of you for getting clean, you always feel the resentment they hold for you.  Their true feelings often come out in arguments and eventually you just dont feel like it's worth it anymore.  
It took me years to get my head on straight and deal with those issues.  All you can do is just stay positive and take it one step at a time, one day at a time.  People may Harbour bad feelings in silence but you can't allow that to stop you from being what you want to be. Good luck to all"

Matthew Cain	I like to think that Johnny Cash just really liked this song and did a cover of it. Is that what happened? It fits him and his life so well.
Eva Elfie	"In 2002, Johnny Cash covered ""Hurt"" to commercial and critical acclaim. The related music video is considered one of the greatest. Reznor praised Cash's interpretation of the song for its ""sincerity and meaning"", going so far as to say ""that song isn't mine anymore."

Jon mo	This version is 🤴
Bloodyrebel	Trent wrote this song from the perspective of a young man battling to keep control of his life over his drug addiction. Johnny sung this song from the perspective of an old man who has battled his whole life with drug addiction, and the mountain of pain/guilt/regret it's caused. I like both perspectives of the same painful struggle, but God this version makes me cry.
Colin	Time is a harsh mistress and watches over all of us xxx
Officer Malloy	"We came here for one reason, to learn to love one another, and with love all else will come. 
Life is like a roller coaster, we will have ups, and downs, some scary corners to go around, but in the end, we all get off at the same station."
Terry Hoffman	The song is so emotional and at first I was saddened because of my age. I love Jonny Cash and his songs.  His life was a life of experience. Noone gets a free ride. We all have trouble, all see heartache. And he at the last of his earthly life didnt pull any punches. He sang it just like he lived, honestly. Being 73 years old I definitely am having these feelings. Losing my wife, child and grandchild and having adult children never call can make you bitter. But why not me or Jonny Cash . Noone gets a pass on unhappiness or grief. He sang it as I am living it. I cant sing it but I certainly will get through it. Thanks J C for the insight.
Marcelo Moura	Cansado desse mundo  ....
Jab Hutt	Rest in Peace TITAN. Thank you from a person that is great grand child of yours!

E B	The song was practically built for his life. Hurt himself, hurt others and in the end his empire of dirt. Its like the success was tainted by the hurt, and he knew it. Everyone goes away....in the end. Such beauty to hear him sing this, its unreal. RIP Mr. Cash.
High as fuck	"I stubbed my toe, last night.




                     - Daniel Thrasher"
Julio Cezar Espindola Junior	"I lost my father five months ago. I was unable to save him from alcoholism. I held his hands while he left, I heard him ask not to let him die, his last words were to take him to his bed.
 In that hospital room I feel the deepest sense of incapacity, since then I live as if I were trapped in that room.
 Condemned to relive that every day.
 In a way, this music makes me understand my father's life."
Ed Mendoza	🌅📆🍃
Ed Mendoza	I remember the next day I woke up and the sun was coming up in the morning I turn on the radio and all I can think about is my friend who I known for 2 years moving back to California hearing this again remind me the good times we had

JeromeB dit Djédjé	"I hurt myself today
Je me suis fait mal aujourd'hui
To see if I still feel
Pour voir si je ressens toujours
I focus on the pain
Je me concentre sur la douleur
The only thing that's real
La seule chose qui soit vraie
The needle tears a hold
L'aiguille déchire une emprise
The old familiar sting
La vieille piqûre familière
Try to kill it all away
Essayer de tout oublier
But I remember everything
Mais je me rappelle de tout

(Chorus )
(Refrain)
What have I become
Qu'est-ce que je suis devenu?
My sweetest friend
Mon ami le plus doux
Everyone I know goes away
Tous ceux que j'ai connus ont disparu
In the end
Finalement
And you could have it all
Et je vous l'offre de bon cœur
My empire of dirt
Mon empire de saleté
I will let you down
Je vous laisserai tomber
I will make you hurt
Je vous ferai du mal

I wear this crown of thorns
Je porte cette couronne d'épines
Upon my liar's chair
Au dessus de ma chaise de menteur
Full of broken thoughts
Pleine de pensées brisées
I cannot repair
Que je ne peux réparer
Beneath the stains of time
Sous les tâches du temps
The feelings disappear
Les sentiments disparaissent
You are someone else
Vous êtes quelqu'un d'autre
I am still right here
Je suis toujours ici

(Chorus)
(Refrain)

If I could start again
Si je pouvais recommencer
A million miles away
A un million de miles plus loin
I would keep myself
Je me préserverais
I would find a way
Je trouverais une solution"
Chris Depalma	true in the purest form

Seppe Meulemans	Only ever hearing the hurt myself line in other video's and then hearing the song for the first time, idk it just does something. This doesnt feel like a song that was made with a big team behind it, it just sounds like he had something to say in an artform he knew and send it to someone to put some finishing touches on it.

Danielle	"Someone I respect alot once said - ""We are all precious pieces of shit"" If you feel like a piece of shit, just know that probably unbeknownst to you, you're precious to someone else.  We all have a purpose, even if it's just being pointlessly silly, or randomly interjecting useless facts into conversations, etc.  And as long as you're giving these people a reason to smile and carry on my wayward sooooon lol but for real, as long as you are making someone smile on the inside, and inspiring them to continue their journey, yours is worth continuing too."

Ricardo França	🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 alguém?

Dorothy Speaks	Love to see June in the video! My sweet girl June
Dylan	This world,  it will only get worse believe it the bible litteraly prophesied all this would be happening and still many prophecies will be fulfilled please turn to Christ my friend we are all guilty of sin the 10 Commandments are called the moral law, you and I broke God's law and are guilty of sin this is why Jesus said there is none good but God but one thing you must know well Jesus paid the fine for us brekaing the law hence why he said it is finished before he died in other words the depth have been paid he died for all of us all you have to do is repent which means turn away from sin forsake it and trust in Jesus for your salvation not your goodness or anything but Jesus because according to God goodnes is morally perfect and unless you are perfect you cannot enter his kingdom for it is a holy place without sin hence why you can never earn your salvation Everlasting life is the grace of God his gift and that not of works lest any man should boast

YadV	Both Trent’s song and Johnny’s song are sad, but Johnny’s evokes hope, while Trent’s evokes dread, and they are both indicative of what living on this planet has to offer. I mainly listened to Trents but thought I’d give this a listen, and it’s a completely different message.

Storm	It is sad to know that in the end life is meaningless. In the end, you should work and get paid to pay your salary just to live and then eventually become an old person who is left alone without anything and finally die. Your only purpose is to transfer your genes to a female so she can make a baby with both half of your and her genes that will do the same for generations. I wish I could die a peaceful death alone without anyone noticing and without suiciding.

Scott	You can tell in Johnny Cash's eye and the way he treated this song... it meant more to him than it ever did to NiN. There is a lesson here for those of us still young. What it is, I do not know. But I do know I need to treat my life, others life, the experience on this earth, more serious and with more respect. Enjoy it all, respect it all, soak it all up.

Steve S	Tough song, true grit, appreciate the depth of it. I hope folks noticed pictures of Christ in it. It hurts to lose people we love - but death is not the end! Because of Christ - I know it, I know it, I know it! I think Johnny was sad at the realization of what was paid for his mistakes and wishing he would have done more/better. I feel that every day. Christ's Atonement heals ALL pain. I know it.

Benjamin Davis	Just toured his boyhood home (2:00) in Dyess Arkansas. His humble beginnings living in depression era and how his family struggled is what gave him his passion for his songs. Makes me appreciate him and his music even more. The 80 year old tour guide that was close to the family made the comment that Johnny worked very hard on the family farm as a young man, and that’s what separated him and Elvis.  There will never be another Johnny cash. R.I.P. Mr. Cash

I cry. Every time I hear this. 
I apologize for everything. To my children... I've been all over the world....but haven't been in your lives....and I've wanted to. 

I speak languages....but not to you....and I regret it. 

My ex wives. To the first.... My infidelity. To the 2nd.... My intolerance. 

To my wife of ten years....that I didn't do everything right since my childhood....so that I could have given you more. (Edit. you've given me more than I'll ever comprehend....and I love you deeply. I will be waiting). 

I wish I had been a better man. 
Even when I do my best... I wish I had been better. 

The way it is.

Jesus.... I'm sorry. For every lash I caused."

Thiago Conti	"lyrics
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

Compositores: Michael Trent Reznor"
Gay Justin Bieber	Cash breathes life into this that Reznor, the creator of it, didn't. It becomes more than just a Gen X junkie tale in the nimble hands of Cash.
Slev	im sorry but nine inch nails does this in a whole other level of intensity and emotional. it's clear who wrote the song and who just made a cover. maybe cash can relate to this song but still it's a big difference. This ver is ok but tbh compared to the original, this version really feels stiff and bland.

ZoneDevil Gaming	"April 27th, 2021. 2 days ago. A close friend of mine just died of cancer. I'm in 9th Grade, and so was she. Listening to this song made me cry for the first time in that time. Her death is very hard on me. Not only because of how young we are, but because I knew her for 6 years. Just wanted a place to vent.

Edit: Hey everyone, just wanted to say that its been 3 weeks and everyday I've thought about her. I've been mad and sad, and there is now a hole in my wall from where I punched it out of anger. I'm doing fine tho, and thank you all for the love and support. Thank you."

Denis OC	Mi mamá se suicidó hace 20 días, yo, no pude salvarla, decidió irse en silencio, llegué muy tarde. Si escribo este comentario aquí es porque ésta es una de las canciones que he estado escuchando mucho desde hace unos días, no tengo ninguna respuesta, solo sé que debí hacer caso a las pequeñas señales, las cuales tenía muy escondidas. Ya es tarde para ella y para nosotros su familia, pero si puedo ayudar a alguien contando al menos en un pequeño comentario lo que ocurrió, lo haré. Espero poder ayudar a alguien, la depresión de verdad te mata y los que nos quedamos, no tenemos ninguna respuesta, tenemos sentimientos horribles de culpa y dolor. El suicidio sigue siendo un tema tabú, por favor no se callen si se sienten tristes, deprimidos o si han tenido alguna idea suicida, denle la oportunidad a algún amigo, a algún familiar, a alguien, de ayudar. Por favor, acérquense mas a su familia, a sus padres, mamá se guardó mucho dolor que tenía, a pesar de que no estaba sola, mamá era una persona alegre, tenía muchísimos amigos, familiares que la amamos, no vivía sola y sin embargo, me doy cuenta tarde de lo mal que se sentía para decidir irse así. Por favor, nunca, pero nunca minimicen la tristeza ni el dolor. (Si alguien pudiera ayudarme a traducir esto a Inglés, correctamente, se los agradecería mucho).
DJ Digger Jonez	There is something very hidden about this song. Like there is a whole  movie trilogy of adventure, horror, and story to share, but it can only be squeezed into one last song.

April Reneé	Relatable... All of it. Watching those around me move through this thing called life like they have it figured out, as if any of us know what the hell we're doing. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Sheldon Metler	Of course Trent Reznor wrote Hurt. Johnny chose to record his version which I think hits harder to the core of the song.

S Pinson	And at this moment of my life, I’m losing someone else😔
Rainier Ray	"... I just watched this song twice in a row and I am so moved I can barely type... So powerful, so meaningful, so heartfelt! If only we took this one song, broke down its meaning, and sought to apply this to our own lives so many of us would stop grinding and striving for what others have already found worthless. Money, fame, power--an ""empire of dirt""... What then is the meaning of life? How do we find forgiveness? Where are we going after we die? And then flashes pictures of Christ, the cross, and the answer becomes clear! As the Apostle Paul said, ""To live is Christ and to die is gain..."" What an amazing music video..."

Sik Chopper	My father was literally the toughest man I ever knew. He grew up in a broken home, with extreme poverty in the streets and everything that comes with that.  Then became a fear gangster from 70’s-80’s survived being gunned down by two hit men, then heroin addiction loosing everything. Then grow old To watching him lay in a hospital bed witnessing this tough rugged man become so frail. I felt his last heartbeat in my hand felt his last breath.

Lēvī	Johnny cash has been my all time favorite singer-songwriter. Despite his record companies limiting his creative freedom he has produced one of the most classic country sounds that is distinctive. Rip you legend.

daniel oliveira	Je regarde dans les yeux de ma mère, et je vois les yeux de toutes les mères, je regarde dans les yeux de ma mère âgée, et je vois les yeux de toutes les mères âgées, et je pleure des vers inconsolables!  La racine du Soleil d'amour naît des mots du monde de la perfection! L'étoile naît d'en haut pour briller aux yeux des cœurs! La Sonate du lyrisme des romantiques est éternelle à la lumière la du récital des versets inspirés par des baisers, et la surprise du bouquet de fleurs offertes à elle dans les étoiles tombée de la nuit!  Le romantisme naît chaque jour dans les idylles poétiques du clair de lune, car dans les carrés de tous les cœurs chantent l'oiseau d'amour! Les enfants voyagent sur le toboggan des couleurs fantaisie dans l'invention de la pensée, la découverte dans les arrière-cours de la vie, la fontaine du printemps de l'imagination! La musique Rythmes orchestre la poésie des strophes du corps féminin, secoue et berce fantastique fantaisie de l'anatomie des pensées! Les poitrines féminines sont des jardins de fleurs de nectar ornementés par la royauté de lingeries! La femme est le chef-d'œuvre de l'homme dans l'art et la sagesse de l'inspiration divine! Ses cheveux sont une source inépuisable d'expressions faciales et de traits, dans le monde transformant et magnifique de miroirs! Le Bonheur est une constitution composée et homologuée par la volonté de l'âme! Celui qui achète le bonheur a acheté le chef-d'œuvre du mensonge! Le sourire est la révolution pacifique de l'âme, et la tristesse la dictature de l'ombre du cœur!  Les rideaux de la symphonie orchestrale de la nuit ont la couleur du clair de lune, et les clochetons des constellations apaisent le tumulte des sentiments! La scène de la symphonie orchestrale de la nuit a la spectacle et performance du firmament, et la musique des Pléiades calme la pagaille du cœur! Si Dieu était déprimé, il aurait rendu le monde noir et blanc! Les couleurs de la révolution des lettres sont peintes dans les rues du cœur du poète! Pourquoi ne pas peindre les cimetières avec l'arc-en-ciel et les sourires des gens avec l'immortalité céleste? L'histoire du salut a été écrite avec des mots vrais, et faite avec de vraies attitudes! Les empreintes du temps sont des pages indélébiles écrites par l'histoire, et sculptent les empreintes digitales des civilisations! Penelope est une course folle sur la tête du poète! Qui a mis dans la mémoire de l'odorat, le scénario de parfums, la capacité de percevoir et de distinguer les odeurs? La princesse bleu est dans l'étoile de saphir, à la lueur des contes de fées des étoiles, souriante comme les tournesols de Russie! Le vin philosophie brille de mille feux, dégager dans les caves du crépuscule du soir, débordant du calice de mariage! Le vin Philosophale brille proprement, dans les caves du crépuscule de la soirée, avec le calice débordant de mariage! Le Vin Philosophe poétique a un terroir divin qui éblouit radieusement, dans les caves du coucher de soleil du soir! La Segóia est la Dame âgée des arbres naturels du monde, une magnifique demeure d'améliorations!  La sirène de l'amour prend aux châteaux de sable, les cœurs noyés dans la mer de l'onirisme des passions!Je montre ce que j'ai à l'intérieur, étant profondément vrai et sincèrement viscéral avec moi-même, et avec les autres, dans le cérémonial poétique du lyrisme sans sang!  Les mauvaises décisions et les mauvais choix détruisent le futur dans l'âme, et renversent et abattrele soleil à l'horizon des perspectives! La bourse du cœur est instable dans les sentiments de l'âme! Le Marginal trace une ligne droite selon les propositions de concepts de design individuels! Le Marginal délimite une ligne rectiligne elon les propositions de concepts de conception individuels! Le mousquetaire bleu du clair de lune est sur le rebord de la fenêtre de la nuit étoilée, obéissant aux versets, et ne craint pas les flèches du malheur lancées contre lui, comme il a l'âme de l'ouragan Phoenix!  Le regard coup de vue de l'automobile brille, scintille  et se reflète aux luminosités des ordre de grandeur, et des excellences électroniques, accélère au vers de la vitesse, déclame le son philosophique du grondement des moteurs, brisant la blindage de la tacidité et de la solitude des rues et avenues nocturnes somnambules! Qui a construit des gratte-ciel planétaires sans fondations apparentes? L'apothéose de la nuit ne scellera pas du rideau des ténèbres le cœur de ceux qui témoignent de la splendeur des étoiles d'amour! L'Oiseau orange se nourrit de vertu dans le nid d'automne, dans la placidité de l'aube du matin, solfège dans le ton érudit les accords de la partition familiale! Les oiseaux orange sur prospère vertu dans le nid automnal, dans la placidité de l'aube du matin, Solfège dans le ton dialectal les notes de musique de la partition de larégional! Les mots portent une armure de lumière et des casques de feu dans le contexte du lyrisme au clair de lune! Sans espoir n'existe pas demain! Sans 'Amour n'existe pas lumière de la vie! Le chien est un intellectuel familier dans la savane du lion! omicron ominous s'est enfui et est devenu anonyme dans la foule! La Vérité n'a pas de propriétaire, elle naît et s'épanouit dans le cœur qui accepte la vérité, ou votre conscience est l'otage de vos folies! L'Aigle sent le parfum de sa bien-aimée dans le fragrance sensuel et l'odeur du vent des rochers! L'Oiseau noir mange de la marmelade, dans le ciel étoilé de fraises rêveuses qui croient en la vérité, même si la vérité est inébranlable!  La splendeur du soleil de la vérité brille plus que l'obscurité des pensées des ténèbres de la mort!  Le Semeur sème la graine attendant dans l'attente d'espoir dans le mariage et la fécondation de l'utérus tellurique de la terre, et et la visite de la main de la lumière du soleil dans la main avec les larmes de joie de la pluie! Le semeur sème l'attente des semences dans l'attente de l'espoir dans le mariage et la fécondation de l'utérus de la terre de telluriques!  Le pêcheur dans étoilé est un semeur de graines d'espoir dans les yeux perdus! La langue des pensées parle la langue des mots! La langue des mots parle la langue des pensées! La guerre se déroule aux frontières et confins   des pensées du cœur! Le pont et  plate-forme du cœur est toujours en émeute! L'être humain ne se connaît que face aux tempêtes et aux ouragans des pensées! L'être humain ne se connaît vraiment que face aux tempêtes et aux ouragans des pensées! L'Homme de Pensées affirme péremptoirement que les discours défaitistes sont conçus et articulés, dans le système du mécanisme de la pensée, à la lumière de la réalité apparente! Le sentiment d'amour est infini dans les sentiments humains finis! La racine carrée de la raison ne multiplie pas les sentiments d'amour! L'Amour est né dans la vraie relation des cœurs! L'amertume de l'esprit peut-elle marcher avec le soleil de la vie? Le signal du satellite est intercepté par les tempêtes comiques, cependant, le signal du satellite de poésie illumine les cœurs de vers!  La Cigale portait la toge d'automne pour juger de la folie de l'être humain! La fourmi macroscopique poétique a dévoré le scorpion et l'aspic, dans la fourmilière de l'obscurité étoilée de la nuit!

Sky McGaw	whats written on his guitar?
Scumbagjohn	This is God.
Gonzalve de Cordoue	Once in a while I watch and listen to this song, so powerfull.
Dude Bro	This song is sad but it reminds me to get up, battle my depression and live. The pain is real, but so is life
bakedbeansface	"Reminds me of Percy Shelley's sonnet, ""Ozymandias"": 
I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: ""Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away."""
bakedbeansface	This is brutal.

Peter Marcus	One of the most powerful, beautiful and shattering songs and videos for all time..
Emma Strange	"I used to not like the change from ""crown of shit"" to ""crown of thorns"" kina felt like it was done to just tone down the language characteristic of Reznor. For some reason on my listening to it today it clicked why actually it works so well. The Christ imagery feels undeserved, he was a drug addict who was the cause of many of his own problems However it was he that put the crown on his own head, hence the liars chair. The original lyrics is self deprecating, the changed lyrics still is, but also adds the additional context of being self aware that he wasn't always self aware.

Amazing how lyrics written by and about a 30 year old fit so well for an old dying man generations apart."
ednan ahmed	Sums up life
Ram Setab	Great song but his first wife was his biggest fan and remained that way till she past. Before you get mad read the bio.

MajesticFirebird	"We did it, lads. 101 million views.

R.I.P Johnny 😔"
barkingspider2007	"Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor  found Cash's cover beautiful and meaningful, going as far as to say ""that song isn't mine anymore"".     
I have to say the song feels like it was written for Cash, his life literally bleeds into the lyrics and the pain in his voice.  Trent Reznor and NIN did a great service to all of us by letting Cash cover the song."

Colin Ritter	My grandfather is dying this weekend and he was a mean, ornery old man who was hard to be around and I was one of the few who could put up with him. Last I saw him he was in a bed, helpless and unaware of the world. It hurt to see him like that. This song makes me think of him.

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

hippieJOSH420	He knew he was on his way out when he made this. I look at this as his final goodbye. So much emotion
Sweet Pepino	This song is a testament to the power and fluidity of music. Cash was able to take a song from so far out of his stylistic wheelhouse, and make it his own. This is the most perfect storm of tragedy and beauty coming together to make one of the most haunting tracks ever.
jesse balboa	Try David Bowie’s “Blackstar” album if you enjoyed this. Written months before his death, and after he was given a year to live, it’s a beautiful reflection on life, fear, and the unknown. I Can’t Give Everything Away makes me cry every time.
Diego De Vita	Best version ever, even better then the original! Miss ya Johnny!!
MIKRØ	Me hace acordar a mi abuelo, es su cantante favorito. Te quiero mucho abuelo gracias x todo 🙏🏻
Energetic Fox Studios	This brings me back to the good old early 2000's cash days, no iPhones, social media, or silly useless gadgets, everything was straight and forward. This song was playing in almost every other store or mall during closing hours. Gosh, I miss those days.

Charlie Valvo	Trent Reznor said he was born to write this song and Johnny Cash was born to sing it. Beyond a shadow of a doubt I was born to live out this profession of absolute truth. The only thing that I can offer is to pass on a bit of wisdom that I learned about in the hardest way. Gold and Silver, Diamonds nor Currency have a fraction of the value of Time. Time is now, was then and will forevermore be the most valued intangible you can manage. It is far to valuable to waste whence it has passed you can never replace it when its gone. So please for you young folks discovering this song and happen upon this comment take it to heart remember it always. Live in gratitude for all you have Treat people the way you would expect to be treated and just maybe you will not be staring at 65 saying I wish someone told me this when I was young.  Peace Always.........cv.

Robert Levy	I will let you down.
Just Jeff	"It must have been so sad for him to see the lost of interest in the House of Cash.  Same for The Burt Reynolds museum in Jupiter, FL. Closed down and decrepit.  The collective message to these once-stars - ""We once loved you but we don't care about you anymore"".  It must be crushing.  But nothing lasts forever."
Steve M	Gets me every time
Nithin Jawali	😢
Ken Swan	The video is as much art as the song and performance itself. A broken man's last love letter to life before he finally lets go. I can watch this over and over again.

Xxwehere ______________________	Beautiful 🎼
Vintage 30	As i think about my life turning 55 tomorrow which some would say thats not old but as I grow older i find myself looking back on life and things I’ve done. I have a few regrets but i have had a wonderful life so far. I only wish that we had the ability to know certain things for instance when we were children one day me and my friends went outside to play together for the last time and nobody knew it. Things like that so you could take it all in. Simple things like this is the last time you will ride your bicycle so enjoy it or this is the very last neighborhood baseball or football game you will ever play. So to all you young people just remember time flys there are no do overs. Don’t be in a hurry to grow up. In school you get the lesson then the test follows thats not the case in life. In life you get the test then the lesson follows the out come of that test.

Los	This is a complete cornerstone of the cornerstone of a song. My respect to all who understand.
Yeshuah de Nazareth	"This song is mesmerising because it lays bare two concepts : ownership and inevitability.
Ownership as he accepts responsibility for his behaviour.
Inevitability because if he were to do it all again he wouldn't do it any differently.
The fateful need to hurt will no see its end because the seed itself is polluted.
He couldn't be anyone else but Johnny Cash. Had he been or would he be any more reasonable, he'd have been someone else.
The lyrics, the music and the voice all merge to simply write an epitaph, his epitaph."

TheCrying Poet	"The knife pierced my skin,
I felt the trickle of blood down my weak arms.
But I didn’t feel the frail skin being cut,
I only knew of the outcome.



I cut more,
I don’t feel a thing
I cut my arms,
My legs,
My face,
My neck.


They will only know me for what I have done today.
The only thing that is worth remembering about me,
For I have made everyone bleed,
The cutting and slashing of my awful words.
I know now what they feel now.
I am Hurt,
From my words,
From what I have done,
From the cuts on my body.
I feel them now.
A red, stinging pain."

Then what was real? The moments and memories of our life or the love we shared?
I believe it’s the love, and when all the love ones in our lives have gone, we then find ourselves In a strange world that we no longer recognize filled with loneliness and every material thing we own is linked to a memory as we find ourselves spending more time in our thoughts and we begin to live inside ourselves which is where our happiness now lies until we die..."
phyzik	Cash was such an OG... SO Underrated... Surpasses, or at least equals, Elvis IMHO... He wasn't the live performer Elvis was, but you could feel his soul in all of his songs. Legend!

Jorge Olan	Papá de texas

Grifter	i think the dispute on style of NIN vs Cash is probably mute. I love NIN but don't really like Cash, but the visuals in this video are harder than trent's words, although brutal themself. I just kinda hate music remakes too. I don't think Cash would write something Trent would.
FugginRambo	I'm so glad he covered this before he left the earth. It's eerily epic and moving at the same time. I wonder if he's on that starship he sang about in Highwayman. Look up the live version
TrueB0SS	When you leave your 6 year clan in warframe.
Daved Richard	thanks to LOGAN (the wolverine) trailer movie, one of the best movies ever.
Henlee Kleckner	100k views away from 100 mil letssss goooooo
Collin Marshall	Reminds me time continues on
BiggestBungus	"this just goes to show, life is temporary. People seek things to satisfy themselves before their inevitable last breath, and always come out with regrets. The things you chase after on Earth are so fleeting and vain. I dont know if the person reading this is religious at all but I am. two years ago i got in a bad car accident and could have lost my life. All that commotion happened in just 30 seconds and it could've been over for me. that was the biggest turning point in my life that pushed me to believe in God.  But I understand that people can have similar experiences and have complete different outcomes. Your worldviews have to be viewed from a lens of ""everything is temporary"". Then you will see others as just as mortal and weak as you and it will be easier to love people. No one knows the time or place they are going to die, seek what is eternal and not going to end up being dust in the end."
Liz Wilson	The lighting in this video is gorgeous.
Bradley Buckminster Jones	Ight, big mystery solved, Johnny Cash is really Jesus.

Kasielle Caulrion	"Lyrics:

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

C38P0 1996	Wonder what June was thinking in this video.
Casey Carpenter	I swear this song really hits reminds me all of the stupid stuff I done to my family and friends and years and years later I finally started to repair everything with my family
Jacob Booth	Ive listened to this song for years, i was raised christian but i never believed in god, i believe in what i see. But this song has taught me People turn to religion for an escape from what we go through in life, they believe in religion because to them it makes all the pain, the suffering, the losses and the regrets all worth it.
Hayden	“If I could start again” hits me every time. Hurts

21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
I Expose The Fallen	Did you know a camel going through the eye of a needle is more likely than a rich man entering the kingdom of god it must have been so hard to be Johnny Cash...the bible is real and theres only a few that would sacrifice there own materialistic gain for a relationship with the savior
$aintAna	This shows is that we don’t last forever one day god will come for us and our time on this earth will be over we are not here forever our youth is slipping away and we don’t even realize till it’s fully gone and we look back and what we accomplished and what we did and we just see a waist of years we had, don’t be a slave to the system I’m not saying disobey the law but don’t waist ur time in school to get a piece of paper to work at a shitty job you hate and to get paid 15-20 dollars an hour our life isn’t worth that little do what you wannna do follow your dream if your dream is to hunt then grab a truck and explore the world and hunt do something you wanna remember when you sit down in your 60s and makes you. Smile and say “I lived my life to the fullest”  and just be ready for the lord to take you up in heaven where you will be able to Rest In Peace for life

Jimbo Morrison	I don’t know if this is the saddest or greatest song and video i ever seen.
Darth Wadim	Good song! Correct!
Jordan Hasch	While I didn't cry like Reznor did when he first saw the video, I WILL say it made me get goosebumps.  Hearing something so bare, so sparse and barren is quite moving.  And to think all it took was a cover from a country legend of a song by an industrial (soon to be) legend.  You can tell by the look on his face, the way he rarely looks at the camera, the way he plays with the songs' simple, direct melodicism, that this might well be his epitaph.

I know probably no one cares, and they shouldn’t, but I just wanted to post this somewhere anonymous to get it out of my system"
Blae	The emotion of this video damn near brings me to tears everytime
i Galaxy	"Was listening this before I went to sleep at about 6am today. Quite fitting really given that a few hours later it would be announced that His Royal Highness, Prince Phillip passed away this morning. I feel like this song could be associated with the Queen's life as it did for Johnny, with all her beloved friends and family from when she became Queen all going away in the end... 

She is the last remaining, God Save Our Queen."

James Festini	How the hell can more than 18,000 people give this song a thumbs down.? Is there really that many people trolling the Internet?Maybe it’s just they’re having a hard time describing how they feel and so they use that and it’s not that they actually hate the song it’s just that they feel down after listening to this song. Which totally makes sense. But I am inspired to live my life to the fullest when I hear this thing especially after watching the scenes. Maybe you too can add a happy face and a sad face to describe the feelings.

FostGamerGaming YT	😢😢😢😦
Bryce Hayes	"This is one of the best country songs ever made. What makes it unique is it moves away from traditional country music where usually talks about God, trucks, love and nostalgia. This song is very dark. It's not the only one like Trace Adkins - Till' the Last Shot's Fired or Mitch Rossel - A Soldier's Memoir, this one tells the viewer how fast life can go and every sin or incident will come back to haunt you. You will indeed regret missing out, you will lose family and friends. This message says ""Don't waste your life, I did."""
LHAV 89	A lot of pain and regret in the world and if everyone could sing like him we would have a lot more of this.

Chris Fox	"This had to be the 20th time I've seen this video and the 20th time it's brought tears.

I've long been scared of death, its called thanatophobia. The thought of losing your partner and then dying of heartbreak... it just destroys me. Even typing that gave me a lump in my throat because the reality of it hurts, that we are stepping ever closer to death. I just hope my partner goes first so she doesn't have to deal with the loss. I know I'll die of heartbreak at that point but that's fine by me, as long as she doesn't have to go through the pain herself."

Claudia Schelfhout	omg im dying here because this song is so emotional LOVE JOHNNY 4everrrr i try for hold on my cry emotions
Gwyn English Nielsen	This video has a lot of symbolism in it, maybe too many symbols. It is a tragic song as the man had a difficult life. But that being said, he had June, a woman who knew how to love him. She was a blessing. Not too many men are as lucky as Johnny was.
dojo dorito	I,ve listed to this song 6 times now but every time It brings a feeling of sadness to me, Jonny was the true king of country

Hentai Sama	Thank you. Mr. for a long time ...
Josué López	Remember this, johnny cash was a really big star in his time, modern pop stars and rappers should listen, he's their ancestor and he's telling them to not get lost with all the superficiality, and he's telling us to choose wisely who we idolize.
SMBShippuden4	this is sad.
Inayat Bin Sulaiman	He died fucking 19 years ago. WTF are you all talking about ?

Willian Gustavo	Alguém do Brasil?? 🇧🇷
Victor Novaes	Essa música é inesquecível.
gihan liyanage	❤️
Alda	essa música é muito boa, pela sinceridade passada nela e como o Johnny Cash abriu o seu coração nela, arrepiando a quem ouve ela, contando o seu arrependimento por não ter vivido e feitos certas coisas e como em seu pensamento, agora é tarde demais para isto, muito sad a musica, no entanto, uma obra de arte e uma mensagem a nós jovens, que vivamos cada dia como o último, que  a gente dê mais sorrisos, abraçe mais os nossos pais, trate melhor os nossos amores uma vida melhor ao lado de nosso senhor criador, Boa música a todos e que tenham um bom dia, vivam a vida, aproveitem, mas cuidado com os prazeres vazios que são fantasiados de felicidade S2
Beautifulhand10	I will never not watch this video without fighting back the tears
SEDA SEZER	Country müziği yeni keşfetmeye başladım. Bunu sağlayan  birazda Anna With An dizisiydi. Ama şimdi geçmişten günümüze şarkıları dinleyerek şarkıcılarıda tanımaya çalışıyorum. Dikkate alırsanız eğer ve yolu düşenlerin  bilmediğim başka country leride önermesini bekliyorum. Sevgiler

Nolan9	We're all addicted to a certain kind of pain.
TheBeast	Truce is life is shit
david hollyfield	His version of this got me listening to Cash. I have an extreme prejudice against country music, but this transcends any genres. It's so painfully raw and honest. He makes this song his own. And the clip showing his age and vulnerability so openly is impossible not to be moved by. What a great note to leave us on. Vale JC
Bumpydane	Really slaps after losing a match of TFT
Jhonel Cordovez	Men, I cried for this song 😢 and I wish that this song will play if I die
PallasAthene12	One of the very rare examples of how a cover version absolutely obliterates the original. Johnny Cash totally made this his own, and respect to Trent Reznor for recognising that.
pokemon club486	Don't waste a life
ROCKIN ROY	great song. he did a fantastic job doing the video and song.
MrGekoon	18k people prob missclicked

Cyprus Cats	the only cat thats real
KevNar Music  (2t Kanal)	I thank U for This!
Ronny E	sry y didnt
aussiefaraday	Even Trent Reznor said he didn't think much about this when he heard the first demo. It was only when he saw the video that he could process and take in the magnitude of it. He wrote it as an arrogant youth, about the pain of living. Johnny sang about the pain of life at the other end. Truly the magic of music and how interpretation can change it for the listener.
Richard Carew	wowy
barbara Thibodeau	Iwantjohnnycashtoplayonherebarbara
Colin Davies	I feel every chord in this song when I play it

Nirav Shah	"The lines ""Everyone I know goes away in the end"", ""What have I become, my sweetest friend"" and ""I would find a way"" suit ""Wolverine"" so much that it seems like the song was made for him only."
Jan Seidl	awesome...  crawling...
Dmitry P	A wonderful song. It turns out that we have the same values at the end of life..... No one remembers what he drank, ate and how beautifully he lived. Everyone remembers how little they traveled, and how / why they loved little...... Wisdom has been pushed back for several decades, despite the acceleration of new generations. Everything is lubricated by the transition period, diluted with instructions and flavored with consumption. We get porridge. And in the end - What have I become?....
Diana Dazai	Trent Reznor really wrote a masterpiece, I don't know why, but when Cash sings it, the song's meaning takes on a very different form than the Nine inch nails.
Vicktor Tarasov	good man
Craig Johnson	This is great art.
Ian Davidson	The Human condition in lyric. Thank you sir.

Martin Kojour	The original Nine inch nails version is much better
john hannibal	"A choice lyric changes (crown of thorns vs. crown of shit), this song always sounded like it was Johnny's anyway

Having Roseanne appear and have her death so close to follow, makes it really haunting and Yair Sasson Art's comment below, ""Closing that piano was like closing his coffin."", is spot on"

Wolfi 2004	"Where is the Lirycs? Now it,s Here 

I hurt myself   To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting

Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

I listened to this song Everyday because I thought I would not be ever able to walk again, even I learned on my old's dad guitar, this song helped me in my darkest moment.

S	My cat 🐈. The only being that has ever showed me so much afection. Was brutally murdered in front of my own eyes by a pack of dogs. The only thing I could do was stare and scream while I made my way down to the street. I found him mauled and masacradred. I picked it's body and between tears I hold him tightly against me saying I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Then to my horror I found he was still breathing. He was lifeless trapped in long seconds, maybe minutes of painfull agony.  I said sorry one last time and also I loved him. I Twisted his neck all in tears and put an end to his pain. I listen to this song and every word is a knive to my heart I should have been there I should have never allowed him to go out on the street, i should have found the keys sooner, i should have jumped out the window and save him. I didn't. I let him down , I made him hurt and now he is gone.

Ken Tackett	I went to the Johnny Cash Museum in Nashville Kentucky and they had this playing where you could hear it at the entrance. I felt really bad for the people working there as they had to listen to it for 8 hours a day. Good song, but that would drive anyone crazy. Seeing the display with the ring he's wearing in the video was pretty cool, though.
Travis Jones	Sitting here drinking mellow bourbon to feel the pain of my stomach burning

Charlie Sager	Every crease in this American icon's face betrays a life as fully lived as surely there has ever been.  Sadly, the American culture isn't as practiced in seeing all the beauty to be found in such a face.  So please look again.  While most could sing this song, unless you're as well-journied as Johnny Cash, you'll never be able to perform it.

Sérgio Damásio	"almost 1am here, and this song is almost like a mandatory stop before i go to bed, something like a permanent remembering of all the demons i personally ( and all of us at some point in our lives..) face every single day, ever since my father passed away 17 years ago this next april 23..demons that won't go away..but demons that my wife tries her hardest to keep at bay..even though she carries her own as well...this song along with say...metallica's fade to black work like a ""ventilation shaft"" for all the pain and anger..

Frederick Mazza	I believe that Trent Reed from Nine Inch Nails wrote this song. I grew up in the seventies on Johnny Cash music from my father I've been a punk rock member of the system I'm so early 70s I've been through over a thousand shows and I have tons of vinyl all my experience in music the man in Black is the only one that deserves to sing this song through the pain and the struggles that he has indoor Johnny rest in peace always the man in Black
Tom S	I wear this crown of thorns, upon my liars chair.
Tina Issa	When 9 inch nails put this song out, I was so haunted by it. So attracted to the raw real emotion not often heard so purely in music. This song is so honest. I believe Johnny Cash heard that message and it spoke to him. Absolutely love both.

Jeffrey Fitzgerald	God I grew up with him.  I remember my parents old 8 track, the clunky sound as you put it in.  You could take it out of the living room consul and plug it in to a steel one in your car.  That big red plastic tape of him.  Times were hard for my family then, and it I knew the songs were appropriate even as a kid.  Today it's this one that gets to me.
Matthew Hall	"If Anyone could help it would make me happy.. In the video there is a split 2 seconds wherein it looks like a young Johnny cash says 
""stay the hell away from me ya here""
Please if you can would you let me know where I can find this movie/show or just inform me If it was just for this track? Thank you..
Just to me it looks like it's from a movie and a movie that I am interested in watching is all.."
Good-riddance-PROPAGANDAtube	"I never got to see him live.   Tickets were $500 his last shows and I was young and broke.

Barbalbero nda furesta	A masterpiece
Wally Leatherwood	"This poignant song, in Johnny Cash’s version, is truly about hope in Christ. No matter the sins or regrets Christ can heal.  The Bible is full of failures who “have fallen short of the glory of God” including David, Paul, Simon Peter, Jacob, Solomon., etc. (Read Ecclesiastes in which Solomon laments life but in the end sees hope.)   Hebrews 4:15 states,  “For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.” 
If you only see what is maudlin  in this song you aren’t seeing Christ as salvation. The crucifixion on “Good Friday” brings resurrection on Easter.
Johnny Cash was a Christian and for all his of his pain and regret in this life he knew he would be with Jesus wholly or holy recovered in the next life."

Darryl Wilson	What a beautiful and haunting song, so emotional. Last week, I lost my mother after a 19-year battle with Parkinson's. This song came on the radio as I was driving home from the store yesterday, and I had to pull over and compose myself. It was an emotional punch to the gut.

Mark Conlan	"Johnny Cash took a great song and made it even greater (much the way Tina Turner did to Creedence's ""Proud Mary""). British record producer Walter Legge wrote, “There is in the last works of nearly every great artist a strangely luminous quality, as if the creative mind had already seen the world beyond death and were conscious of things infinitely greater than the emotional experiences of this world.” That's what I hear in this record."

Sgt. Pepper	I want to thank Nine Inch Nails for writing this song.  Johnny wants to thank  you, too.  Arguably, the best song he has ever done... it is for me.  Johnny was true Americana.  Thx for celebrating America, Johnny.   We miss u, my friend.

rmgravis	Rick Rubin is genius
Vania Lima	Que voz incrível
Rodney Sauveur	That is great!
atamagashock	This song has had a huge impact on me since NIN released it in 1994 I believe. I’m pretty sure It was my freshman year of high school, or maybe a few months before. Anyway this song has always been emotional for me, but Johnny took it to another level, and this video made it even harder to watch and listen too. Especially since it was evident a legend was in his final days, at ultimately a pretty young age considering. But thankfully he left us with his masterful rendition.

Sanne	Immer wieder schön..eine liegende.
JB Storey	First time I heard this song, was while watching the TV Series, Smallville. A show that was normally heavy  handed with it's more emotional moments... but for the scene they used the song in... it was heart-wrenching. I didn't actually know it was a NIN song until about a year later. Hearing the original, I was totally blown away by what Cash did with the exact same song. It was already heavy duty. But Cash really extracted the very meaning of the lyrics in his version. I believe even Trent was blown away by what he did. A haunting song, that is a fitting last hurrah for a very complex man.
Danillo Ruffus	Is this music is perfect
Terry Gilmore	best song ever you could feel his pain with this song

CHIVALROUS VILLAINS	Reflect on your own life.  Even if you've lost the one you love, be thankful for what you've had.
Triippy...	"it's not even the song for me,
nor is it seeing John so feeble and frail and close to the end of his life.
Rather it's seeing June having that realization in the video, knowing her best friend is ready.
That part is what fucks me up, as twisted as it may sound, I'm glad the neither of them had to live without each other very long, as John passed shortly after June. 
even ""Til death do us part"" couldn't keep Johnny away from June"

Ronnie Mac	Grew up listening to NIN and always connected with hurt. As i was seriously depressed and would get fucked up on any kinda drugs to mask the pain. Got into country later in my teens, Cash, Waylon, all the Hank Williams and many more. Anyway I've struggled with heroin addiction for the past 6 years, I've pushed away that many people who i loved and loved me, most couldn't watch me destroy myself. This always hits me hard, its a fucking masterpiece. I hope one day soon to be done with all drugs and stop hurting the ones around me that I still have.

Black Night	I remember when NIN came out with this song. It was so good but then when this came out...it was like a ode to Johnny’s life. Makes me cry every time. Beautiful remake. I’m also happy he didn’t say crown of S. I feel he’s come to Jesus here. At least I hope. God bless him n his family.
Dr Chuy	A Legend born too soon. A world we would be with him again. Johnny cash voice. Bless easy.
R M	You got to listen to it, when you are feeling happy. So full of sad emotions, it makes me cry and I think of my father and mother and all the friends I lost .Afterwards I feel whole.

All my friends are dead or in prison and theres nothing left of who I once was....I always knew...and thats the hardest part.... finally understanding im not fixable or savable....all I got to my name is an old Z28 and a .45.....thats all I got in this world and its not enough anymore :/ Everyone I know goes away in the end...often I wonder why

I said...Jacob i don't know how to answer...i just pray you never know.
He said why do you listen to these songs that make you cry...in my head im thinking your killing me kid.
I said its not a bad cry...its comforting to me. 
You know ive had struggles and thats what he's singing about. 
We have something in common and it helps me like therapy. 
What the heck ...how could i possibly explain to him. I always tell him the real truth about life but not this truth."

MiryValeGabryDidin	"Oggi mi sono fatto del male
Per vedere se ero ancora in grado di sentire,
Mi sono concentrato sul dolore,
la sola cosa reale
l'ago fa un buco
la vecchia solita puntura
che cerca di eliminare ogni cosa
ma io ricordo tutto

Cosa sono diventato?mio amico più caro
tutti quelli che conosco
vanno via alla fine
e potresti avere tutto
il mio impero di sporcizia
ti deluderò
ti farò del male

Indosso questa corona di spine
sulla sedia del bugiardo
pieno di pensieri spezzati
che non posso riparare
sotto le macchie del tempo
i sentimenti scompaiono
tu sei qualcun altro
io sono ancora qui

Cosa sono diventato?
mio amico più caro
tutti quelli che conosco
vanno via alla fine
e potresti avere tutto
il mio impero di sporcizia
ti deluderò
ti farò del male

Se potessi ricominciare
milioni di chilometri lontano da qui
manterrei me stesso
troverei un modo"

I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Ellebi	How can even one person dislike this masterpiece?
Robert Argetsinger	Ok so just my opinion(could be not what cash was going for) but is this a video about a man who just all life struggles with addictions left and right, grieve and guilt about his past(with the death of his brother jack, poor father, and how he wasn’t there for his children), and overall how we lack the ability to do what’s right. The song honestly is so hopeless until the end when it shows Christ being crucified for our sins and how though we are all struggle greatly there is redemption found in Gods grace in his son. Idk that’s just how I like to see it.

J	"The message in this song is so damn...human, and what it means to be that in our temporary existence. I am always moved to tears by this song. J. Cash was obviously very religious, and a large part of the iconography came from those beliefs, but it remains to me a broader, secular message, that we can all feel. What is life? Why is their loss? Why so much pain? Excluding religious folk (of which I am not any longer), this is up for debate. Even though I can't believe in a God like he did, I sympathize with that need to believe. I still feel it now and again when my reasoning fails to answer these existential questions, my mind wants an ""answer"" and I feel that is why people pick up religion. When I think of my eventual death, I find myself like J. Cash, thinking about a time and place where ""I found a way."" The tragedy and pain of this soul searching is beautiful... I wish we were a species that thought about existence (and our eventual death) more, beyond religion. I feel like it could help focus our energies better. Instead of deluding ourselves that death only happens to the unfortunate, until the absolute last possible moment. Doing this has drained me. Perhaps to far to come back from. But I'm trying to find ""a way."""
Conny Malmgren	Amazing how this song has a new meaning everytime I listen to it. The video and song together just makes it even more amazing. NME is not wrong, probably the best music video ever made.

Peter Grinham	The most haunting song that I have ever heard. No human being could fail to be moved by that.
Jonas De Waegenaere	"Good songs are timeless. He wrote this song at the end of his life before I was born.
I like the song because it is very soothing and peaceful.
But as the title suggests, the song is about pain, about being hurt and with every word, this song is breathing that pain. After all, it's sad because he has lost many people in his life and he has been through a lot."
BinkB	If you didn't know, you'd think this was written by or for him. Johnny Cash breaks your heart with this ballad. There's nothing more to say Johnny, RIP

Ricardo Williams	"Hello, I am a Spanish speaker, my English is not very good, I just want to tell about my uncle's death.

Today, my uncle who I loved very much died, he died of Covid.

he was a hardworking man and well, he was the happiest person in the family. At every family reunion he always had a joke to tell us



One day before his death, He fought with all his strength, he had a gallon of oxygen, during the morning his saturation was 48%, that meant certain death. But he kept fighting, in the afternoon, he had a saturation of 80%, that made me very happy. But unfortunate the next my uncle died, his lungs were 80% damaged.

My uncle left children, he fought for his life with all his strength until the end because he wanted to live to be with his family but unfortunately that he died but he will always live in our hearts and memories.


If you are reading this, if he has a family member with fighting this disease. Fight to the end. There will always be a chance that his loved one will recover :).



Post data: For those who do not believe in the coronavirus and do not have a family member fighting this disease, for the asymptomatic who believe that wearing a mask is annoying and useless. You do not care about your life and less about the lives of others, a person does not learn until he loses a loved one.

muh C	"As someone who was taking my life down a twisted path. This song has an extremely deep meaning to me. If ever I lose my way, if I'm ever to stop appreciating those I have, what I have. I ask those around me to play me this. For all the fame, all the money, all the things we use to numb ourselves. We can't blind ourselves to the life we live. It's real. It's going to be hard. But the thing I fear the most, is becoming an old man who looks back and regrets not doing more. Not telling my family I love them every day. Every time I've argued over something stupid. The friends I've left and the precious time I've wasted. I spent so much time moping and complaining about my life. Yet I never appreciated those precious things I had until I heard this song.

Live your life, love those close to you, make as much happy memories as possible and avoid bringing negativity. Some people believe that hell is a creation for the after life. Yet the truth is, if you live poorly it'll catch you up in the end. Make sure you have things to hold onto, make sure you'll have people holding onto you, make your mark on existence as beautiful as possible because you can't go back and change things, and when the bell tolls for you. You'll be trapped with everything you've missed out on. You are precious, life is precious. Never stop appreciating how sacred this world is."

The Knights	"Full Lyrics :
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

He (like myself and MANY others WHO  ADORED YOU) would have  wished you would have been around to serenade my new grandniece or nephew into this world.   Thank you.  Thank you for everything."

splunkism	"Anyone reading this, I'm going to be completely honest and not blabber on about how everything is going to get better, because it isn't once you hit that peak in your life that point where you only go down is only going to get worse and I cant help you with that nobody can that's something we all have to deal with ourselves. And its going to suck for a long time but soon you'll hit the bottom and you can finally rest not in death but in joy maybe in tears I know I will. One of my biggest fears of growing up was dying as the last surviving family member of my family having grandkids but not having my mum my dad my brothers my sister my cousins my Aunties my uncles to be that last speck of dust of the past, I feel like this is how Johnny feels when he was singing this song and its how I feel every time I listen to it like I'm going to end up as some lonesome old man in this world I cant comprehend with this completely fucked society that cant get over themselves.
I just wish that nobody goes through this and that I don't.."

Emerization	One regret I have is never watching this video with my Memere. She was an amazing woman and the reason I even know who Johnny Cash was. This will forever be the definitive version of this song and I wish I could have shared a NIN song with my favourite gal.

lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Will this Country put up with the killing of their people passively?  In the United States approximately 1 out of every 80 Americans is gone forever, and in other Countries.*  The exterminations continue on.  Is Myanmar the only Country who's people have balls?  The only Country where there are men?  Men who will put it on the line for their women, for righteousness and truth?  During and before World War Two the Catholics Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini started an extermination like now, for the Pope of Rome.  They used the guise of a typhus epidemic to round up people in to concentration camps and exterminate them using zyklon B gas.  When the powder is exposed to atmospheric air, it causes people to suffocate.  That is the same symptoms of the corona virus.  The Pope is being exposed as the king riding the Roman Empire.  He rules the Vatican City State from his compound in Rome Italy.  The Pope rules over the kings of the earth.  Look at the history books and you will see that his representatives anoint kings to their throne.  There were 10 kingdoms he ruled over at the beginning, but 3 were eliminated, and then there was 7, plus the Pope's kingdom is the eighth.  The Pope is chosen from those 7 kingdoms.  The Pope has his own crown, flag and government.  Check the United Nations listings of member Countries!  On his crown is written in Latin, vicarious filii dei, which has a value of 666.  Like the Roman letters on a clock I=1, V=5, X=10, and so on.  *The Empire is also represented by the cross or X.*  As already mentioned it represents 10, the ten original kingdoms.  They will say that it is the Taw of the Hebrew Bible as mentioned in Ezekiel 9, but that is not true.  The last letter of the Hebrew alphabet represents a mark both literal or figurative.  People were getting a Taw put on their foreheads who were sighing and crying over the disgusting things happening in Jerusalem.  God was going to do a cleansing and the Taw did not represent salvation, as People were being marked, Ezekiel said, if this continues that none would survive.  How can the Taw(mark) be for salvation, when he said if it continued no one would remain?  Revelation-Apocalypse 18 says that in the church /government riding the Roman Empire is responsible for the slaughter of all people on earth.  Nazi Germany for one(Hitler still considered a good Catholic), Herod the Roman governor of Judea, Israel at the time of Jesus(real name Yeshua) put the children of Bethlehem to death trying to kill the Messiah,  Herod beheaded John the Baptist, the slaughter of the Native American peoples, all slaughters on earth.  Revelation -Apocalypse 18 mentions that the colors of the people who run the city above the Kingdom of Rome are Scarlet (Catholic Cardinals), and Purple (Catholic Bishops).  It mentions a future time when no Bride or Groom, would be heard in her again.(Where do Brides and Grooms get married ?  Roman Catholic Churches and daughter Churches.  Rome tried to say that America was the great city above the kings of the earth, when it started this war on the US and world.  The US has no king, they fought a war to get rid of kings from their people.  The Roman Empire tried to destroy the US, once it was being born.  Time has passed and people have forgotten.  Around the year 538 the Roman Empire decreed the death penalty on any one observing the Biblical Passover or the Biblical Sabbath.  Sunday is a fake Sabbath called the Lord's day, so people will assume that it is reffering to the Biblical Sabbath.  The Bible for told these events happening, but ending 1260 years later, which was the time of the birth of the United States of America's beginning and the French Revolution.  The Pope's kingdom was overthrown from Rome Italy, and moved to Constantinople.(Now Istanbul Turkey). The  Roman Empire's rulership from Rome Italy was restored by Benito Mussolini in 1938, which was the beast's recovery from it's deadly head wound, mentioned in the Bible.  Rome was the first Empire on earth to constantly have a military wage war continuously in perpetuity.  They are either waging war on their own people or other nations and peoples.  Any who think that the Roman Empire is God's Kingdom should think, would God's kingdom decree the death penalty for observing the Biblical Sabbath?  Revelation -Apocalypse says, to come out of this Church/Empire alliance if you do not want to receive her plagues.  She kills by plagues.  There was the Spanish influenza which killed a large part of the population, the typhus epidemic that killed 12000000, in the America 100's of millions through disease laden blankets and things like that.  Every time that there is a plague, the media comes out with a story about removing Indian names from sports teams, which is to distract you from the real removal of the names and lives of Native Americans.  They exterminate under the guise of epidemics and pandemics.  They are trying to say that this corona virus started in China, because they have to focas your rage some where.  Like Hitler turned Germany against Russian Communists, even though the early Churches had a form of Communism.  Attacking Russia made no strategic sense, but it makes sense, when you realize, that they don't care how many die to protect their fraud, they will fight tooth and nail to distract you.  They must distract people from the reality with lies.  Donald Trump said that America was being invaded from the south in order to get people to do drastic things.  He lied.  Trump's friend was telling Americans that Communists were going to kill them, and they should kill them first.  America bombed a Chinese embassy not long ago, and said it was an accident, but China has not bombed or violated the US.  They are being attacked to cause you to hate them, just as Hitler unjustly caused the German's to hate the Russian Communists and people.  The Pope says that he got His authority and traditions from the Apostle Peter of the Bible, but this is a lie.  The Pope says Peter was celibate, so that is why he and his priests are celibate, but according to the Bible, Jesus (Yeshua) healed Peter's mother in law.  The only way you can have a mother in law is to have a wife.  There is no other way to have a mother in law.  The Apostle Paul remained single, and he said, I have a right to take a wife, just as Peter and the Apostles did.  He chose to be single, but was not required by God to be.  The Pope's foundations are fraudulent.  The Roman Emperor was killing the believers of God in the Roman Empire and some people accepted falsehood over death.  The Roman Empire used it's continuous military power to spread the false system.  I think the guy who started that idea of a continously warring army had a name some thing like Marya.  So when Catholics-Romans talk about Marian tradition, they are not talking about Mary(Miriam, of the Bible Jesus's mother) but are talking about the war doctrine.  The Church became a way of controlling the conquered peoples.  Like the Bible said, *you would not be able to buy or sell, with out the mark of the beast.  The cross symbolises the mark / teachings of the church,* false Sabbath, Easter instead of Passover.  *In the Catechism of the Catholic Church it mentions that any one leaving the Church, can not be spoken to, and you can not buy or sell from or to them.*  They have been trying to pin a pandemic on China, but that is fraud.  Canada shut down planes from Mexico and the the Islands below America for no reason.  Britain and Europe have supposedly multiple strains of virus in people and animals, but there is no shutdown of planes from there, and no stoppage of animals or animal products.  There is an extermination like that of World War Two happenng.  *Please pray for me, copy, record, distribute and remove all traces of your encounter with this!  Clear YouTube search and viewing history and browser history and cache!*  Not long ago no one had ever seen a virus, nor were there any vaccines.  Scientists say that it would take decades to create a corona virus vaccine, if even possible, yet right now every one and their dog is creating one.  In fact my dog came up with a cure 100% effective.  My dog urinates in a glass, and then he has you drink it. You are so disgusted that you quit eating for an extended period of time, (which is called long term fasting) and then you make a complete recovery.  In his words he says,""Ruff"". It's a little rough, he means, but you can do it.  In fact some times my dog urinates in to the wind, so probably just going outside will expose you to some of that, so you can skip the drinking part.  We are living in a time where my dog is smarter than most. You know what my cat says?.....nothing, cats don't speak.....lol Accountability.  The Bible says, by justice is a kingdom firmly established, and many governments are teetering on complete collapse. +There was genocide going by the Roman Empire, so they intervened to stop it, unlike the United States where 1of every 80 people are dead, and they debate whether Trump should be impeached.  Medical staff have revealed the systematic killing.  A Politician revealed the falsification of hospital information, sending sick people to nursing homes to increase deaths, and extermination camps(actually I guess isolation camps).  Now cowardly United States is thinking of invading a sovereign nation because they intervened because of genocide.  In stead of stopping the genocide in the US, which the Pope says will be over 13000000, they will chose to support the genocide in a foreign Country.  No need to be fearful, because God is ultimately in control.  He says, he's making all things new.  Revelation Apocalypse 21:4 says he will wipe the tears from all faces, and eventually will not be remembered.  Then the real life will begin.(world wide) Cattle"

This song really was about Johnny living in regret and especially depressed from his child hood when he lost his brother to a accident chopping wood while his brother told him it is ok go I have only a few left and when Johnny left the blade failed and it was the end so this song is really about regret."

Lazarus Thibodeaux	"Johnny Cash was not a perfect man, no one is.
He did bad things, we all do.
But, at the end of his life he was sorry.
This song (which is a cover of “Hurt” by Nine Inch Nails - More info here: https://youtu.be/oQkS-fvOBLE )
serves as Johnny Cash’s final apology to all those that he hurt.
The only thing he changed from the original was changing “Crown of Shit” to “Crown of Thorns” because he knew how people idolized him as a music legend.


We forgive you, Johnny.
We all do."

I just come across it now on sofa whilst the daughter is sleeping on my chest. Playing on BT speaker in the kitchen loud so i can still search tracks with waking her,  this time this song just made tears go down both cheeks full tears streaming, god knows how it did that to me lol. The YT train only started when i tried to shazam simon garfunkle sound silence  piss take version at the end of a Simpsons episeode,  i was gona play house of the rising sun after that but seen Johnny's Hurt and thought yesss not hears that in ages
....... then tears. I dont cry!
I was happy b4 and im happy now bit that track did something  it never done b4.
Probably years of hidden buried emotions just rattled out its box, the 🔐 in my brain vault must of shattered through resonances."
Eduardo Botelho	Incrível... Conheço essa música há tantos anos, já vi esse clipe inúmeras vezes... mas não tinha prestado a devida atenção aos detalhes, à profundidade do tom de despedida que música e clipe demonstram. Essa combinação audiovisual é, simplesmente, uma obra de arte!

Michael Carl	This song is moving, heart stirring, and very emotional. It seems that his version of the song is his reflection on the value of the things of this world much like Solomon in Ecclesiastes. He told us that the things of this world—fame, wealth, and success—are nothing compared to the value of his faith in Jesus (crown of thorns) and his family.

Felipe Silva Tech	Nine Inch Nails rules
Tibor	As you go through these comments and distant memories of the better past, you might see my comment, and if you do, allow me to tell you a story. I had a friend, she was amazing, trustworthy,  always there to count on and to make your bad day better, and I was lucky enough to call her one of my best friends. But as all good comes to pass, with time, we came into an argument; short, quiet, and full of emotions covering true words. Little would I know this would be the last time I talked to her, the real, her. And as this song says, if I could start again, a million miles from here, I would find some way to fix this.
John Est	He pours his heart with this song like a cautionary tale of regret. A wise lullaby before the embers fizzle out.

You can’t change the past, but you can make a change today! Peace

HEAVEN OR HELL, I'LL BE NEXT TO HIM."

Aidan White	This song is not only a message if you think about it. I feel it's a letter to his wife (I know it's probably pretty obvious that's literally what it is) but nobody could recreate the emotion from this though because it comes with age and experience. Rest In Peace Legend

Tisrok	"I listened to this song as a kid. I grew up on Johnny Cash in the home and in the car and everywhere. 
As a kid I didn't like this song when I first heard it. It didn't have any meaning to me. I hadn't experienced the hardship necessary to understand the meaning of this song.
Almost 20 years later, I decided to give it another listen. I fucking ugly cried. 
The Man in Black.. His presence, the person he was, to see him this way and the ""What have I become"" just broke me. Rest in Peace Johnny."

Jorge Moreno	"lyrics:

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

His wife, his children, his life.. what if he was like me. What if he had a life... an actual life that wasnt this. That wasnt standing here by an overpass. I passed him a 10, and his eyes welled up.  What led up to this moment... this life is to fragile. Hold onto every moment..

Dog in a tux	Best song of all time
Oscar Pérez Gómez	It last near 4 minutes, but it hurts for a lifetime 7/03/21 🇲🇽
L. Time	Keep in Mind he recorded this song in 2002. released the song in 2003. I would bet his wife passing away is what made Johnny fade faster than anything.

Christopher Herald	...

Mr Big	Goodness!! You need to retire man!
TBOHN	"Trent wrote a masterpiece 
Cash Immortalized it"
Maya Cave	this cover is so beautiful, the way he made it about old age instead of the original, about self hatred. I'm only 18 but somehow I feel it so deeply. His best song in my opinion. He reinvented it in a way that is his and his alone, thats what making a cover is about.
Carlos Howes	This song broke me in milions pieces
Stephen Bianco	"A Lifetime experience in a song and words that penetrate the reality of his existence.  It is the haunting confession of the path Johnny took through life,  how easy it is to lose one's self,  and the regrets that come along with it.   At the end he says it all:

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

texaswildcat2000	"The imagery mixed with the words makes this a very powerful feeling video....wish the Man in Black was still around....almost 18 yrs later and it's still as powerful as it was the day it was released...even brought the writer, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, to tears...when the writer and original artist of this song feels this version is better than his own, you KNOW it really IS the best....even Justin Timberlake felt the Best Male Video award should have gone to Cash instead of himself, Timberlake won for his video for ""Cry Me A River"", at the MTV video awards in 2003..."

Keltton Casavechia	"Alguém já disse aqui que essa é a melhor música do mundo? Pois ela é.
SENSACIONAL, JC como sempre uma voz que arrepia e uma melodia que dá vontade de rasga o coração e picar em filetes, cê tá doido. Pena nao existirem artistas que conseguem ter uma carreira que seja tão fodastica como a de casa, bão só conturbada mas fantástica até o fim e que não fosse apenas por ganância. Por fim fazemos o que podemos somos o que nascemos !"

Daniel Thompson	I'm 22 this year, and this song goes down somberly with a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco, reminiscing everyone that I thought would still be at my side today, and how wrong I was about all of it...
D J Matthews	The Yanks who complain about the flag in the background of the Muppets video are the racist ones, because JC was a southerner and that's it. The flag has nothing to do with racism, a lot of people died fighting for that flag. If there was racist slave owners in the South in the past, the flag still doesn't represent only them. There are racists in America today, so using these people's logic, the modern day American flag must be a racist symbol as well.
Christopher Cutsail	I am 1 years old and this song makes me cry 🥲

عبد الرحمان ابن نافع	"“Hurt""       en lyrics

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Tony Matejko	All I can say is......Damn!
Adnan Moiz	"Mental health and the stigma attached to it need no introduction to the people who carry the burden. Some people carry the burden, keep it from others. I have decided to publish (in book form) some inspirational tales from such people.

I am collecting stories (single pager) from people who have suffered in the worst possible ways from depression and have tried to commit (or thought of) suicide. They can share their suicide notes, the story of how they have battled their way out and survived and ending with a smiling (inspirational) picture of theirs.

Currently, I am looking to connect with people who’re willing to contribute to this project! If you’re interested, please get in touch!!"

Kai J.	I remember Bono saying: Trent Reznor was born to write this song, Rick Rubin to record it, Johnny Cash to sing it and Mark Romanek to make this video!
Zbigniew Nowak	"Słucham tego  utworu co jakiś czas w wykonaniu Casha, jest on o wiele lepszy niż oryginał NiN. Cash nie był doskonały, ale był prawdziwym mężczyzną. Nie ma już takich.
Prawdziwy mężczyzna codziennie walczy ze swoimi niedoskonałościami i taki był Johnny. Brawo Mistrzu!"
Jay Enlightened Titan 369	Legends live on!! if I'm wrong why are we listening??
Sammy Tooma	You are somebody else, im still write here.
Jay Enlightened Titan 369	Disastrous for the soul.pain,truth,life it's all the same.

Citysue	God bless you Johnny Cash - a legend worldwide.  You are so loved!
Chase McCann	Nine Inch Nails may have written this song but Johnny Cash owns it.
old80sguy	I don't just listen to this song, I feel it.
Mary Bennett	Johnny definitely felt every single word because he lived that life, An Empire of dirt,,, and he truly regretted it all, because in thee end nothing else mattered but the love of his mother, of his wife/family and more importantly the love of his Savior who he knew he was getting ready to meet. I know Heavens gates opened up for Johnny, when you regret and repent so deeply in your heart and ask Thee Almighty God for forgiveness God forgives. My favorite line in this song and I feel it was Johnny’s as well,, is this... If I could start again a million miles away,,, I would keep myself, I would find a way. ♥️🌹🎶🙏🏽☝🏽
Braden James	This is nothing less than a masterpiece.

Lukacs Ladiszlau-Nicolae	When I was listening this song for the first time,it was like a big part of my life was just passing before my eyes.And...I was full of regrets because in many ways,Johnny Cash's life seems much more like mine.Full of pain because of many bad choices I made and above that the pain I inflicted to the others with that bad choices.And many of my good friends disappear because of that.And about 9 years ago I was saved through GOD's grace like Johnny.Before it's too late,return and repent from your sins like Johnny did.Ask for forgiveness through JESUS CHRIST,repent and you will be saved.GOD bless you all.

Captain Deadeye	He took a song about drug addiction and with just a simple change to his country style, he made the song into a reflection upon his life. Rest in Peace.
Nathaniel Wildstone	Even though this song was picked for Johnny Cash, it turned out to be perfect! It was written as a young man, but Cash made it his story of one who is looking back with some regrets. “The needle tears a hole...familiar stain...” is a reference to heroin addiction, which Cash struggled with. He really made this his own, and it’s one of the best covers of all time!

Der mich gleichgültig macht. Was ist aus mir geworden, meine guter Freund, jeder den ich kannte ist doch am Ende verreckt, du kannst meine Seelenschreie haben, mein Königreich des Schmerzes, keine Ahnung was es ausmacht, aber ich werde dich auch verletzen , die Dornenkrone mit meinen unvollkommenen Gedanken,

Em Vill	Can't get through a life changing project fast enough, the purpose of why I exist. It's destroying me within and I can't turn back for reasons I can't explain. In the end, to dust it will all go. Even if I find success, I don't see any point afterwards. This song gives me comfort in the form of truth and reality that I prefer to deal with. Rest in peace Johnny Cash. We're all going to the same place.

Grant Pendleton	I almost never cry but for some reason the night I watched this It made me cry and I don't know why, you will always be my inspiration Johnny Cash
Brian Webb	if anyone gets sad by this song, look at it like this. This song 100% tells the life of an addict, the pain, loneliness and all that comes with it. Cash was hit hard with that and I have a feeling thats why he chose this to sing.  But look at it as a warning what not to do and how to treat those you love. . Just my 2 cents could be way off. You can have everything in this world but it wont make you happy

But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away

I would find a way"
Know Jehovah	"The earth is becoming warmer, wetter with fires and floods, loss of species and the deadly covid. But there is hope, because God (Jehovah) said he ""did not create [the earth] simply for nothing” but “formed it even to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18.) because he has set a day where he will restore the balance of nature through a heavenly government, the one found in the Lord's Prayer 'Let your Kingdom Come' (Matt 6:10) when on earth ""'No resident say 'I am sick'"" (Isaiah 33:24) So put your faith in that heavenly government (kingdom) now and be among those that will 'inherit the earth' when he restores it (Matthew 5:5). Thank you.

Nicolas Devorador dos Mundos	"""O último clipe de Cash, Hurt, já era encarado pelos fãs como uma espécie de despedida extraoficial. No vídeo, filmado em outubro de 2002, o cantor aparece sentado em uma cadeira, quase imóvel. Àquela altura, ele já estava cego e não conseguia mais andar. Em uma das cenas, June observa o marido com tristeza e compaixão. Não à toa, o último foi também o clipe mais emblemático do cantor."", site: correio do povo."

I am not sure how much longer i could have continued with that emptiness in my life and I am quite sure this song saved my life.
Thank you Johnny Cash for this gift to humanity and may you rest in peace."

I watched her walk down those steps, and then regretted it. But shrugged off the feeling. For the next two days, I spent energy and hours looking for her. She went missing, and we couldn't find her.  I kept walking with my sick body until I couldn't use my voice, I couldn't move anymore. Another day passed, and we come to today. I looked into my neighbors yard, and there she was. In the corner of a window well. Frozen, quiet, and dead. I let her out, and she froze to death as a result. I. Don't want to live anymore."
kadin cornelius	If your failing. Good! Learn from it, build something from it. Use it as fuel to never go back to that state.

Gourab G-Log	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Greg K	Quite simply a magical cover or an already great song, made even better by a legend whom elevated this to a level where it is so profound that if you close your eyes you can see where you have let people in life down and wish you could say sorry, or just spend another day with that person whom you may have lost. It's so moving, special, timeless, epic. there aren't words that cover the wording from Trent Reznor and the vocals from Johnny
Mauricio	Feliz cumpleaños maestro!
Andrew j wheeler jr	It makes me cry just thinking about the moments of memories of everything you treasure in your heart that's no longer here with you any more because life itself is so precious you ' all never know till it's gone or you I feel this very deeply because it's real no matter how hard it is it still hurts rest on sing on brother Johnny ( Nashville) cashville kiddo😞😞😭😭.

gris186	This hits home hard when you suddenly realize that you have been an awful father and husband not giving your family the love, attention and respect they deserve. Working 60+ hours a week, never having time to read a book to my kids or to sit down and take some time to enjoy their world of play, not showing my wife affection... I cried listening to this song. I cried a lot. As Johnny sings 'What have I become, my sweetest friend?' that's was exactly what was on my mind. What the hell happened to me? I didn't want to leave this world in the future having these same thoughts because I chose to be an asshole. So, I quit my job the week after and now I work 30 hours a week, pick up my kids almost every day from daycare, I get to sit down and enjoy my time with my wife and  honestly it is the best thing I have done in my life. All thanks to a song I heard on the radio by coincidence.

Project C.J.J	Rip Johnny Cash
samura!	"It hurts.




Being a man in his prime, having all the fame and money anyone could have wanted, with your loved ones still around and looking at you as a friend or as a son. Throwing it all away because you lost control of your desire and gained a hunger for an unquenchable addiction. Only caring about the high. And then only to grow older and wiser, looking back at your past, reminiscing on all that you had and all you had done, your achievements, your regrets. The wound heals but the scar stays.
So yeah, it hurts."

I Provide Lyrics	"[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here


[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

I think toward the end of his life, this song is a good example of how much credit he gave to a lot of his achievements. R.I.P. Man in Black"

I only got a chance to book one of his shows when I worked in entertainment at isle of capri in Lula at the Arkansas Bridge setting up green room,VIP photo area and concert hall I met him and his family including the brother and sister in law. The show was epic wish I could go back and asked all the questions I had on my mind about his life and career. I met so many musical artist Loretta lynn, George (no show,) jones,Crystal gale,and so many more. I love Johnny Cash God's gonna cutt em down. Great man great legendary music 🎶
bics1967	Johnny I know this is a cover and it's covered so well. My grandad listened to you and my mum loves you but she didn't get your modern stuff....I get it though so another generation loves you and I love everything you did. This is the best cover of any song ever. Thanks buddy x

annihilationHaven	The line you walk is that line that brings some stress, some tolerable stress, but it's never supposed to go overboard. If your adversity is so unnecessary, and so painful that you don't want to participate in your own life, you have to do something about it.  Sort of like going from the fire back to the frying pan, but that's the key to life - you never go overboard, but you have to expose yourself to some suffering, even till the end.  There's adversity that makes us stronger and there's adversity that no man can possible overcome.
Ocin Lehnnad	"amazing cover! and the perfect song for Johnny to say ""Good bye!"" he felt that would be his last song and YOU can FEEL it too!"

Phantom	First song I learned to play on guitar was this. I listen to this song almost everyday. Either to smile and look back on the life of The Man in Black. And to feel every word of what he sings because most people can relate to this. If you can then I’m sorry for whatever pain you’ve been feeling. As cliche as it is, life does get better
LESTER RAWLINS	RIP Johnny.  I am getting old now.  I have an agreement to meet with my dad on Copperhead Road on January 1, 2060.  But after that I am hoping to meet with you.  Maybe my dad and I both could meet with you and talk about the golden days of country music or maybe something more celestial.  Such sadness expressed in this song.  I hope you are now in a heavenly surrounding.  In any event, we will come looking to meet with you right after January 1, 2060.  Don't give the angels a hard time in the mean time. See you soon Johnnie.

Andres Espana	When i broke my back this song saved my life i was in my liars chair ready to end it not knowing if walking was in my future. I listened and listened all while crying and holding a pill bottle. I listened till i cried myself to sleep. But woke up to this song and after feeling sorry for myself I decided that my hurt wasnt over yet. I decided i would walk I decided that a broken spine head and knee were not strong enough to make me give up. I hope somebody in troubling times reads this and knows that when times are at its lowest you keep on going cause brighter days are around the corner.

edrica webb	Amazing how Johnny Cash's voice is still so passionate even at this age.  Really great video, but could've done without the flash videos of Jesus.  And before anyone starts beating up on me for saying that, if you're religious, you don't want a regular person compared to Jesus, and if you're not religious, you don't want a regular person compared to what the religious people think is a god on Earth.

Extropian Transhuman	so powerful his success - he went through so much to get to the top and everyone who wanted it couldn't do what he did - he said if you really want it, you can have it - but really people didn't want it - and maybe ruined him for something they didn't want - pathetic.

To see if I still feel

The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
slipknotforlife	I miss jhonny so much 😭😭
nicodegallo7	The one thing the original has that this song doesn't is the terrifying ending, that for me is what makes it so horrifying and depressing. This one just ends on the normal chord, no surprises.
Lawrence Taylor	"I'm not a musician but I let music move me emotionally.  Gladly. There are many singer/songwriters who write masterpieces, works of art, and yet there is someone else that uses their song and adopts it as if it is their own.  Johnny had done that with many others, such as Kris Kristofferson.  But he was never possesive, he always acknowledged the creator.
This is a great song, but it is elevated to a masterpiece by Johnny and his crew.  Thanks Trent, thanks June...and Johnny.  And Roseanne."

debra fitzsimmons edwards	What do you do when you cant cope??i was once happy.....
Moontinkle Productions	I have always thought this song to be Mr. Cash's best recording. I never watched the video until today though. I wish I hadn't. The song is excruciatingly sad all by itself but, to see him in the video and how sick he was just tore my heart to shreds. Laying in bed with tears streaming down on my pillow at 2:30am.
Steve the red	Think of those that wanna bring you down and feed of negative energy... Thats the vibe I get... And I related too.. Be rid of all negativety...
Siena Stirling	♥️
Abigail Eldritch	"I will always remember the first time I heard this song.
I was eating breakfast with my grandpa which was a usual morning, my grandparents always kept a radio with country music playing. It wasn’t my thing.
But one morning I’m sitting there, eating breakfast with grandpa and it comes on. And I tuned in all the sudden and I remember having to leave the room to handle my emotions.
Me and grandpa, we always watched that movie about Johnny Cash. I always knew about Johnny’s life. And when this cover came on, my heart really shattered.
Now my grandpa is gone, and all that memory is is...ghosts of the past. Draped in the beauty of nostalgia."

Horst Humbug	"Auf Deutsch.
Heute habe ich mich selbst verletzt,
um zu sehen, ob ich noch etwas fühle
Ich richte mich auf den Schmerz,
die einzige Sache, die wirklich existiert.
Die Nadel reißt ein Loch,
der altgewohnte Stich;
versuche das Ganze zu begraben,
doch ich erinnere mich an Alles!

Was ist aus mir geworden,
mein liebster Freund?
Alle, die ich kenne,
gehen am Ende fort.
Und du könntest Alles haben,
mein verschmutztes Reich.
Ich werde dich fallen lassen,
deinen Schmerz werde ich dir bereiten


Ich trage diese Krone aus Dornen,
auf meinem Thron der Lügen,
voll von zerrütteten Gedanken,
die ich nicht reparieren kann.
Unter den Flecken der Zeit,
werden die Gefühle verschwinden
Du bist jemand anderes
und ich bin noch immer hier!

Was ist aus mir geworden,
mein liebster Freund?
Alle, die ich kenne,
gehen am Ende fort.
Und du könntest Alles haben,
mein verschmutztes Reich.
Ich werde dich fallen lassen,
deinen Schmerz werde ich dir bereiten

Könnte ich nochmal neu anfangen,
millionen Meilen weit von hier weg;
ich würde mich selbst bewahren,
ich würde einen Weg finden."

GPD	"The end of this song If he had another chance he would find a way to keep himself. So he can find another way through his son and his son's son. The sins of the grandfather will visit the third and fourth generation KJB..
 we can change everything."
Tohigh4this	"This will be the song at my ending. The end of my funeral will be played out by this song and  Everytime I hear this masterpiece I can't help but look back at my life. When he says ""you can have it all,my empire of dirt"" I think of my daughter and what i will leave her when my time has come. Thank you Mr. Cash for blessing us with pieces of art that will be with us till the end."

LateNightRewrites	"""The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting""

Oh man. I remember talking about this song with my buddies when I was 15 years old. My friend (the ""edgy"" one) worked at a movie theater. He was the risk taker of the group. He said even he was scared of heroin because he heard from his step brother that it was ""too"" good - a concept foreign to my young mind

God do I wish I would've listened to that sentiment. But here I am, years later and able to show my scars for every single line in this song.

And I remember everything"

jarek916	I'm not crying , I'm not crying , I'm not crying...............dammn I'm crying!
zombiebatbunny	I love NIN and I loved their version of Hurt. But Johnny Cash took that whole song to a new level and I think Cash did more justice to the song than Trent Reznor did. Both are great, but Johnny Cash's version hits so much harder.

HeatherLoves	Stupid ads delayed the hurt...
david69	Wow que canción tan linda y magistral interpretación
Rick Hofstee	I like Johnny Cash, I think he is apologizing for the way he chose songs in the past because the recording companies pushed him in that direction and now he knew he fell for the lust of money, his soul was weighing heavy. This song from nine inch nails spoke to him and I think he needed to sing to us.
Ross Adams	"He's singing to June.

He reminds me of my wife's grandfather. When Gene lost Susie to cancer years ago he became a husk that wants to die so he can be with her again. Fucking heartbreaking but that is the same love I have for his granddaughter so I get it."

Under Elbow	"This song really hits the weakspot. I grew up in Bosnia and was born in time of war, losing my sister 27 days after my birth. My mom commited suicide when I was 3 years old, father died from  illness. I was 14 at the time, just started my high school. Life feels empty, you just don´t have any motivation left in you to do anything. No one to make proud. It hurts every day, you feel out of place and just that worm compfy feeling is missing. I hope that noone else needs to meet this fate at young age, its destructing, ""atleast"" at old age you don´t have to endure for such a long time.
I wish you all good heatlh for you and your loved ones, if you are fortunate to have them still around, cherish the time spend and please don´t breake bonds with them because of anything."

Then I found the courage to tell her my new awaken feelings about her and the she didn't even reply with a yes or a no. The next day I saw in a story that she was with another guy. That botherd me😩. I was mad an sad to her about her decision to not tell me the truth. It was just before new year and the came that song. Whenever I listen to that song it reminds me about that time.

Jack Ward	who is in the picture frame?
Jason	I think this version is initially about regret, guilt and self-loathing, but in the final verse the same lyrics are used in a different light - it becomes a song of acceptance, self-forgiveness, and a reminder to those who have made mistakes in their lives to not let them be the end of you.

One of my favorite bumper stickers says it all... ""Don't be caught dead without Jesus"". Only Jesus can give us back the wasted years, and in the end, gives us victory. Johnny and June were Christians when they died, and that's a good place to be."

Michele Lee	Powerful!
Becky Lippa	"The most beautiful. For every arthritic pain and emotional place of hurt, he claimed it and never let another in on the guise of comfort to vicariously take from his experience. Maybe a model in this video as his sweetest friend, or maybe a place deep in his mind and body. Who knows? In any case those secrets should rest with him. I am grateful for the glimpses of such a tumultuous life through his music; and, in my opinion that is where they should rest.
There is pleasure in pain, privacy and safety; but, it must be one's own, such a beautiful glimpse of an amazing artist. THX J. Cash ❤️. I'll see ya, hopefully not too soon  :^)"

msmwkc	When I was a kid my mom used to say she didn't like Johnny Cash's music because it seemed like he talked his songs rather than sing, but after this, especially 1:15, it's pretty clear he could sing like hell when he wanted to.

Alanthiel	"This song is the only thing keeping my life together. I lost both my parents, my wife and my son 3 years ago in an accident. I listen to this song twice a day, morning and evening and cry my damn eyes out. Its the only thing that gives me strength and power to still raise my daughter. Not a day goes by without i still think of all of you that i lost, not even an hour. I cant remember the last time i dident cry myself to sleep. My daughter always ask me why i cry and i dont know what to tell her. I dont know if its sad or good that she was to young to know you, in some selfish way i think it might be. But all the love she's missing out on is unfathomable.  

Im still here, to the end for my daughter. For my family, a million miles away.. i will see you again when im just an empire of dirt."

Michael and Carina Photography B	"2 years ago and a couple of months, I was laying in the emergency room with alcohol poisoning, AGAIN, for like the 4th time in a month. I was just barely regaining consciousness - my wife was in the room with me. She’d called an ambulance when she found me unresponsive, an empty bottle of champagne and half a bottle of vodka in my hand. I’ll never forget hearing her voice echoing through the haze of waking up hungover. “All I want us a good life with you.... where are you, my sweet friend?” 

Hearing that broke my heart but I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t move. When I woke up she was gone. I looked up this song. Went to AA the same day. 

I’m 2 years 1 month sober. Lost 60 lbs. Working out 2 hrs a day 6 days a week. Learning how to play guitar. Spending evenings with my best friend, my wife, singing Johnny Cash songs. This one though... this one will always hit different. 

Each day is a victory, even if it’s bittersweet to remember our failures. Each day is still a victory, and a gift. Be well friends."

Jacob Osborn	Thanks to Johnny Cash for editing this song. Thorns are a whole lot better than the other thing...
Smokey	this is how i feel about my relationship with Jesus. Word for word. Minus the needle, i hurt my self in other ways. But it is an exact replication of my sitiioun with Jesus. I have been destroyed by demons. Held captive. I have stock home syndrome now, it messes me up. With Mommy. She or He is a demon, the nice one that comforts me. My mind has been destroyed but my soul still survives. when they leave i am completely normal, when they come I become there puppet. It's like (10 years ago, 10 and a half i asked God for help when i realized i couldn't help myself). the demons came, they have tormented me and destroyed me in every way. i have nothing left in life to live for.

Andrii-Vlad Popa	"Maybe the saddest song I`ve ever heard. Regret and misery, in a rich setting where only the wine and memories (including the suffering) seem to still matter. The last four lyrics (""If I could start anew..."") seem to get to the bottom of misery and regret or to the bottom of a wine lake."
garba super	best song i’ve ever heard
Jenni Madden	Beautiful words and music that can only be listened to when you are ready.  Not a song to recommend to the young
Stephan Vervloet	I have never been a fan of Mr. Cash, but this final song hits nerve and bone. I'm struck to my core, and i'm not joking. These words make you think about your life.
WereDictionary	"I love this cover.

Trent Reznor's version is all about the aggression and existential crisis of a not quite middle aged man

This one carries all the regret and weariness of age."

vicki oliver	"🛠 The book of Daniel tells of a kingdom that will be in this world in the end times., represented by the feet and toes in the statue…..🌍
🌍This kingdom being set up now will be ruled by the antichrist till Jesus comes to destroy it.🌍
🌪Tribulation is coming on to this world, 🚩if you haven't accepted Jesus as your Savior, now is the time to do it. I beg you do it now, time is short.
ABC’s of being saved
Admit you are a sinner…………….
Romans 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
1 John 1:19 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
Believe Jesus is Lord…………….
 Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Call upon His Name……………....
Romans 10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
🎆 JESUS LOVES YOU🎇"
jon gilbert	I can't listen to this without tearing up 🥺 the feels man the feels.
Marco Cinque	"COMMIATO
(a Johnny Cash)

Da quasi vent’anni sei andato 
“un milione di miglia lontano”
le parole danzano sugli accordi 
come una malinconia di spine
la voce è rotta, piena di rughe
le lacrime ingoiate sono ricordi 
quel treno corre a ritroso sopra 
suoni che scandiscono il passato
tutto quel che avevi è un tavolo 
apparecchiato dove siedi da solo
e il tempo è un nodo che stringe 
le corde vocali della tua tristezza
le risacche di ombre sovrapposte 
diventano l’unica nota che resta
e il martello del rimpianto batte 
sul chiodo fisso d’ogni pensiero
accarezzi il pianoforte per dirgli 
addio, come se fosse la tua bara.

m.c."

Welcome to hell humans	I love all country music because most of it tells stories of the musicians life and this is the most connecting song to me and it also tells of how his carreer was going and all the struggles and hardships he went through me and my uncle both like his music because to use it’s the best of the best and he tells the stories the best way in music is what me and my uncle both agree on

Jonathan Key	Dear Johnny Cash, if you’re up there listening, I WILL find a way! Thank you for your wisdom
DlyOnTheScreen	Honestly i think Cash did it better than NIN. While Reznor whispered the lyrics, Cash was louder an sincere, and there's a subtle gruffness in his voice. The guitar worked far better than whatever NIN did and the end of the original was a pretentious clusterfuck of electronics.
Brian Pendlington	This song sent me down a Johny cash rabbit hole,  I’ve been enlightened and educated and have nothing but respect for this man

May you always rest on peace Johnny  and may you meet your wife again in death."

Roman Semyonov	I don't understand English well, but I cried when he sang.
ass milk	rip
Elena Mamais	A beautiful song of lamentation. A song born out of life. The words, the melody, the visuals especially with his wife so caringly listening and observing him Oh! it was sad, burns your hearts, makes your soul weep and yet so beautiful, authentic, and most of all HUMAN. Miss you both. HURT - says it all doesn't it?  I am so glad that I found it. Thank you Mr. Cash. Your last musical statement was so profound that touched us all. May both of you rest in peace.
Geovani Barbosa	É um som que eu sempre posto quando estou só com minha moto!..
Tiernan McCulloch	Really hope if a Last of Us Part III gets made (which I think it will eventually) that Ashley Johnson gets to sing this as Ellie. Really fits her character after everything she did/went through in Part II. Not to say it could ever top this version, but I really like the covers in The Last of Us II because they show the new meaning songs take on in the new world, without prior context to how the songs used to be sung before the outbreak and the lacking instruments they have access to, it brings a new sound to most the songs.
Zosia Adaszkiewicz	I remember hearing this song for the first time at my theater classes. For the first time in my life I had the impression that someone described how I felt. I was 12, but understood everything. Half of my life I struggle with eating disorders, body dysmorphia and suicidal thoughts. Today my mom called and told me that my 10 year old brother wanted to kill himself. The world is too tough for us, sensitive souls.
derek west	I feel you Johnny
FrankieYLosMatadoresOficial	Dang...
☀️bella the basset☀️	Ever one I know goes away..... awww that makes me so sad:(  he’s so sweet and kind! R.I.P. :(

Nick Anjal	Just an amazing man, the world would not be the world without  Johnny Cash.
Clarke Statham	"At 3:28 cash says he will find a way, the way he refers to is  I'm almost certain is ""The Way."" A reference to John 3:16. And anyone who has as much interest in JC as I do might draw similar conclusions. would like to know,,,"

Branislav Lacko	I want to write one thing here. Through my life, I've taken 13 types of antidepressants and none helped me. But then I've discovered Tryptophan, amino acid which your body uses to make serotonin and melatonin, hormones of happines and sleep. And since I am taking it, I feel much better, and it has no side effects and you can buy it without prescription. Try it and see.
Hirsty	Saddest song I have ever heard
Ben Caetano	RIP Johnny from one of the many slums in Africa
Poisen Ivie	Damn it ,,why does everyone leave me ,, I'll die alone ,,left with only memories
Poisen Ivie	Song sums up my life,,everyone has gone or is about to go ,, when he walks round his ol house n touches the tree ,,its like me goin home to boarded up ol house ,, everyone gone , once I thought I had it all but it was all just dirt in the end

Simonas Akrutas	Me finding this song, plays on repeat, cries in corner everytime
shoktar	my favorite part is around 2:30-2:45 because it shows his wife has been by his side all these years. I feel like this video is a reminder how we all face death one day and the best part of life are the memories.
michael lyter	Life's ruthless.
[Insert good name here]	""" Everyone goes away.. in the end.. "" this part hits the hardest for me because it's true. Somehow everyone you know will go away in the end, and you can't stop it. Your friends, your loved ones, your family. They'll eventually be gone. And songs like this make me different since it makes me think of many different things.. I become philosophical, yeah thats the word. Like to me the meaning of life is change. And that includes death, since that Is change. You can't stop change, you live your entire life to change and become a different person. Everything around is like that. Now have I told you about my sponsor Nord VPN with this.."
Shane Laredo	This song means a lot this year
joe mama	RIP cash,  you will live on Johnny
Jim Weitzel	A true song that expresses  loss as only Johnny Cash could
I.M.S.S	the og billie eilish
logan megginson	i dead ass asked my parents who johnny cash was and they made me listen to him for a hour today
KJ's Angel	"When this song was originally released by Johnny Cash I didn't care for it but at that time I was so grounded to the original version of this song by Nine Inch Nails (Trent Reznor was the writer of the song) that I couldn't see through as to what Johnny Cash's version was lending to the remake of the song. From 2002 to 2021 I have seen alot of good, bad and very evil things since then....19 year's later I watch this video and hear the song remade by Johnny Cash I can actually say I', 19 years older than I was then and now I can see, understand and appreciate his version of Hurt. Sometimes it takes life to bring you back to the stops you missed the first time to show growth within yourself as a person. The song now has a different and adult tone in it's growth....When your a ""kid"" in your 20's you don't always have adult appreciation of certain things, like this version of the song. Thank you Johnny Cash for bringing this to life once again in a new light."
Lidor Shimoni	"JHONNY IS KING.
EVEN TOUGTH I JEW - I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH. ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS EVER."
Ross Stancher	there some wisdom in this song, showing that having all the riches and the fame isn't everything. we can spend entire lifetimes trying to have it all but in the end it is only our loved ones that matter.

CRVZY KVRMV	When I master rythym, my Martin will make my finger tips bleed in your flow’s name. Not Johnny Cash, but the flow that guitar made when you played it in the black. kinda ironic I’m leftie too...Not trained right. Born rightfully so. So it’s weird because my familia didn’t know for a minute I used left to start drum solo’s and write. My distance from them made me lose....Few hopes but still.

2. Should I be seeking immortality or is that useless?

4. Should death scare me?

Mustafa $.	"Canımı Yaktım

Bugün canımı yaktım,
Hala bir şey hissediyor muyum görmek için,
Acıya odaklanıyorum,
Gerçek olan tek şeye,

İğne bir delik açıyor,
Eski tanıdık sızı,
Hepsini dindirmeye çalışıyorum,
Ama her şey aklımda,

Ne olmuşum böyle,
En sevgili arkadaşım,
Tanıdığım herkes,
Eninde sonunda gidiyor,

Ve sen tamamına sahip olabilirdin,
Benim kirden imparatorluğumun,
Seni yüzüstü bırakacağım,
Senin canını yakacağım,

Bu dikenli tacı takıyorum,
Yalancılar sandalyemin üstünde,
Kırık düşünceler dolu,
Tamir edemediğim,

Zamanın lekeleri altında,
Hisler kayboluyor,
Sen başka birisi olmuşsun,
Ben ise hala tam buradayım

Ve sen tamamına sahip olabilirdin,
Benim kirden imparatorluğumun,
Seni yüzüstü bırakacağım,
Senin canını yakacağım,

Yeniden başlayabilsem,
Milyonlarca mil öteden,
Kendimi olduğum gibi muhafaza edeceğim,
Bir yolunu bulurdum..."

To see if I still feel

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have…"

Lee Maxwell	If this song doesn't grab you deep to your core you aren't human ❤️❤️
Lucas Iemini	I remember when I was a teenager I was reading Cash's biography. He had done some very questionable things, lived a very selfish life, deceived some people and still he made it to the top. I didn't finish reading the book, but whenever I hear this song and see this video, I feel like Johnny was only human, and even though I do not believe he could redempt himself in the end, the empathy I feel for him, and the truth his voice has in this song really makes it all go away. I mean, he could have been anyone of us. I know for sure I would have made many of the same mistakes he made, so I am really qualified to judge him? No, none of us are... We all hurt people, we all do bad things, that doesn't mean we are defined by those mistakes. We aren't the sum of our mistakes, but rather the sum of all of our actions.
Rash	It's kind of crazy as if Trent Reznor actually wrote this song for Cash. Both are amazing versions but Cash's gives a finality to it.
FloridaMike100	I want this played at my funeral.
Stef 4wheels	One of the few things in the world that make me cry.

Z C	It a good but dark song
Chappie Prime TF	The like button in this video should be infinite and you no longer have the option to remove it.
THE LOGIC ONLY ZONE x Dangerous Duke	This is the consequence of music as a means to self, where, music is and should and can be used as a remembrance to people, groups, places, and heritage, and practices, instead of as a means to wealth, gain, and self focus and remembrance.  This is the pain that comes from not being a part of something bigger and of being with and a part of others.  Music is not for gain, or expression, but to patronage to others.  A story we tell for the future to make the world a better place.  Johnny cash failed in this, and up to his last great song, which was a cover we see this.

Stefan Kraan	"And then you hear this and you see the video and then you think about your own live and the song tells your story ass well. And then you go back to the good Times and the Bad and you remember the Friends i lost and you cry inside but i also remember and love the shared great experiences and Times. And then i fully take in the beauty of the song and the lyrics. 
What a great gift, thank you"
Poop Achang	I know this a cover of a NIN song but even they said he owned it
j rooneo	Like omg, I just got it
hyenaswine	Damn he butchered that song.
The Mighty Almaty Squirrel	I understand the line ‘I wear this crown of thorns’ is biblical imagery, but I also believe the crown of thorns is a reference to him being able to get whatever he wishes due to his wealth, but it is painful as it reminds him of the life he used to lead, when he did wrong
Keith Christopherson	This is the most beautifully depressing song I’ve ever heard. Strange how I can relate to everything he said. Heavy,moving, and true
Stephen Cole	Pain has never, should never, felt so beautiful
Bob Shultz	If you get to the end of this song and you’re not crying, your heart needs warming.
frank arcoli	"The heartfelt and painful but saving song of a man who takes leave of life and reconciles himself with his world. He still sings in peace over there Johnny.

TikiGodsRule	HURT is about addiction to me and what it does to you, your family and everyone you know.    This has special meaning to me as I lost my daughter to drugs, mental illness and homelessness.    You start by coming down on them , then thinking they will grow out of it, if we did this but it ends with accepting they have to want the change and nothing you do matters until they do.    Its hard to watch someone you love die each day and you can't do anything about it.    The song HURT describes this tortured life better than anything I've heard.    Thanks Johnny.
litngfan4life	"...""everyone I know, goes away in the end"". The sadness is truth, and the truth is pain, and only Johnny could remind us of this every single time we listen to this song... and then show us the hope in Jesus that saves. This song is insanely powerful on so many levels."

God entered inside of my body, as an angelic body!	God entered into my body, like a body. my same size. holy ghost baptism. God does voices of devils and all witchcraft and voices people hear saying do horrible things
Nerd4Life	Just goes to show. Johnny, the biggest act throughout the 50/60/70, finally realised that he couldn't take anything physical with him. We'll ALL eventually learn this too.

Ivens Melo	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Terry Lewis	Watched many times and brings a tear to the eye every time.
HiYa Pal	In the end, he clearly regretted not seeking Jesus more closely, like his older brother that died, had been encouraging him to do. We so easily become distracted by the temptations of Satan, and often waste the time that God has given us here on earth,  and we lose sight of our salvation, and waste the time that God has given here, to seek and serve him.
Will43	a man is walking in a us vietnam war uniform drenched in blood, clenching his pistol. a firefight is happening behind him but he doesn't even care anymore, he's broken.

...unfortunately."
Katherine Donahue	Greatest cover known
Road Kill	The more I listen to this the more I'm convinced Johnny has given up on life and truly felt unloved and alone. Despite all his fans and most importantly June Carter always having his back. It makes me sad seeing the pain in his eyes and in his voice. Long live J. R. Cash, may he be at peace and reunited with June Carter somewhere over the 🌈

Phil Harland	I just love listening to Johnny Cash, such brilliant heartfelt lyrics! RIP!
Petaurista	Everything about this song is pure genius. Clip, music, lyrics Cash's voice...
Jordan Davis	This cover and the original song are both so powerful. In the end, it is really about interpretation. Nine Inch Nails is singing about depression and the feeling of everyone leaving when struggling the most. Johnny Cash is singing about old age taking everyone he knew, and questioning where his life has gone. Still, they are both singing about pain and hurting, which makes them both so emotional.
Rémy Rose | Akai	"How can this not have a billion views wtf... what a masterpiece, so much emotions
This is a cover but feels like Johnny Cash wrote it, it's just perfect"

Nikki Moore	I lost my mom 7 months ago, I haven't listen to this song in a while.  It was totally awesome, I just sit with my eyes closed and sing.  The first part, I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.  I cut myself when she died, just for me to feel pain, so I wouldn't cry so hard of losing her.
Anastasios Tsiatis	EPIC VOICE....
chuck O_o	So this is what it feels like...
Mark Grubb	You always related to the poor and downtrodden my friend. It was a pleasure to become friends with Janette Carter at the Carter Fold. You had my book and Janette was wanting you to consider Rusty Chain as a talking song. You were busy back then and well, funny how time passes away. Thank you for the memories of meeting you in Washington, D.C. in 1995.

Cryptid	"Lyrics so you can realize that it hits *even deeper*

“I hurt myself today,
To see if I still feel.
I focus, on the pain,
The only thing that’s real.
The needle tears a hole,
The only familiar sting.
Try to kill it all away,
But I remember everything.

What have I become?
My sweetest friend.
Everyone I know, goes away, in the end.
And you could have it all,
My empire of dirt.
I will let you down, 
I will make you hurt.

I wear this crown of thorns,
Upon my liars chair,
Full of broken thoughts, 
I cannot repair.
Beneath the stains of time,
The feeling, disappear.
You are someone else
I am still right here.
What have I become?
My sweetest friend.
Everyone I know, goes away, in the end.
And you could have it all,
My empire of dirt.
I will let you down,
I will make you hurt.
If I could start again,
A million miles away,
I would keep myself,

I would find a way.”"

Mark Schlegelmilch	I'm only 25. But this song hits me so hard. I struggled with alcoholism from 15 till last year when I got sober. For so long I was stuck in that pit of despair and sadness just trying to like myself and figure out why I am alive. Nowadays I am happier and getting to know who I am. But when this song plays I am sent right back to those moments where I wanted nothing but to climb inside a bottle and die. But that's why I love the song. I came back from a dark dark dark place and this song reminds me of the pain and hurt that was with me every day and is still here. But I can face the hurt now. I'm a better person now than I was. I will not hurt myself today but I will remember the hurt I was dealing with for so long and continue to better my life for myself and the people in it.

Andrés Aguilar	I had to remember that pain of the soul that sits in that voice, the last drops of wine on something that you have and that no longer matters, just let the minutes go by waiting for life to pass, closing my eyes and just seeing the dark sun for the last time.

Bruna Silva	Wowww
Joy Of Satan	Watching his fingers run over the closed piano at the end always leaves a lump in my throat
Sean Mates	I'm 35 and now and then I have an existential crisis fearing death. When I watch this clip seeing Cash as an old man, I am filled with peace. No longer am I fearful to grow old. My only prayer now is to grow old as gracefully as he did, perhaps even leaving some legacy behind xo.

DOOM SLAYER	War crimes with Johnny cash
Evan Cargill	The people that disliked this I fear will just not ever be happy in this world.  And Trent Reznor understands your pain.
C-olé	"My grandfather recently past away a couple weeks ago. He was always a fan of Johnny Cash and music. Every time I hear this song, I think of him. Not just because the song is performed by Cash, but because how much my grandfather related to this song. About how if he could start again he’d change so much and about how to enjoy the little things in life and not take anyone or anything for granted. 
Rest In Peace Papa."

ApokaLex	New Years Day. You visit your parents to wish them a happy new year. But you notice there is something wrong. Your Mom is not sitting at her place. You go watching after her and finding her with a heavy breath and hardly addressable. One and a half hours later she didn't respond to anything anymore. A day later she is dead. She had cancer and didn't say a word. Happy New Year  ☹️
synstr6	God bless Johnny Cash.

Stephen McKeown	"I remember a sub teacher showing us this about 4 years ago. Young teacher , trainee . He was talking about his friends passing and really philosophical for a reasonably young guy. We all thought he was crazy . He also showed us “Fire Away” by Chris Stapleton. Another emotionally charged song . Looking back , he was grieving and was venting and finding so much therapy in these songs . He would analyse the video to us , at the time we were like okay dude are we going to get on with the class? 

I really appreciate what he was doing and I’m glad I have developed and understood how he was teaching us things about life that at that age, we didn’t care about . The death of my father at 11 and other bad times have accelerated my emotional findings and maturity. Thank you to that teacher .

(Ps you can actually see him on YouTube giving a funny pick up like to Amanda Holden on the Norton show from the audience lol. )"
S N	"Pain occurs beacuse evil exist, evil exist because after God creative us his angel got jealous and told God we are not worthy of God and we are weak evil said I can get them to worship me instead of you!..... God said I'll give them my love through faith go try them we'll see if they'll worship you or they'll keep their faith and love me back. 
And here we are... What is happening by this race is stripping us our humanity! 
Breaking down without my family without my relatives my friends, because people aren't living up to their humanity! 
How this elder ended up with his only reality is pain? 
My faith is shaking inhumanity has robed me of everything. 
Still forgiven."

faith*•.	My dad cries to this song every time he hears it... they say men shouldn’t show emotions like that because it makes them non masculine. But my dad has a heart of gold and he listens to this song and thinks about his mom. And I think that’s the manliest thing ever.

J B	A lot of recent views, I guess we're all in out own little funks right now along with everything else and it sucks.   This is not an easy time of year for a lot of us in general, me too.  Let's just keep going a day at a time, try to find the positive as hard as it is right now for us.
Jennifer Capps	"Its even crazier that since 2014 my perception hasn't changed and I ain't got good outcomes by the opposition of the rest of the folks or places with roles of the highest and most authority and support organizations are included in these situations that isn't any better than the other and I ain't got perception based information for the info on factual actual realistic events that happened to.myself and personal experiences that I survived and everything else that I was making sure documentary proof of evidences but kept ongoing ing til right now 2021 and the stupidity based bias with rest of basics of normal living has changed with nothing but their claims and verbal tales and actions to get ok with and away with such ridiculousness to put me in the lowest terms of all groups and professional credentials I had also . With being a survivor TBI in 2005 and miraculous that I woke but I had many past careers and was overachiever with records to support validity of my experience and expertise and now just the worst controls and the worst for rest of this listed folks that isn't any perception of good or knowledge and skills to be a great victory to their teams of the highest and most importantly the member or reasons of their causes or conferences and it's BULLSHIT!  BUT ITS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO CALL BULLSHIT AND ALL HAS WENT THE OPPOSITE WAYS AND ITS HELPED SIDES KEEP ALTERED EXISTENCE AND ITS HELPED LIFE NE TALEN WITH JO BASIC STUFF AND NL SYABLE ACCCESS WITH SAME DISCREPANCY AND THEIR PROFITS ALSO.  BUT I HLGIESS I JUST SEE THE ACTUAL GOOGLE PLUS PHOTOS THATPROCLAIMED THIS. THE CHALLENGE SINCE APRIL 2014 JOURNEY THATS JUST PERCEPTION OF DILLUSIONAL VERSIONS OF OIDIOTS THAT RULE MOST OPERATION METHODS IF U WANT TRURHFUL FACTS AND JUST SAD ALL LOST LIVES STILL NOT MATTER AND SURE NOT NOW THE MOST AND IT'S STILL SICKENING AND ITS LIFE I PERCEIVE AS MISERABLE AND FACTS FOR HUMANS LR EITHER ITS INDIGNIFIED AND ITS DEATH AND DIGNITY CHANGED WITH THE PERCEPTION OF PERCEPTION AND IT'S THOUGHT YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK OR THINK ABOUT ANF IS I JUST PERCEPTION CHANGED SI MUCH WITH TIMELINE???

alex t	I hope he's rest in peace!
try new hard stuff pls!	Most powerful video and best cover of all time. Will never be beaten! R.I.P Johnny Cash x
teaberrywmn	Only Cash could put such emotion to words and melody.  The world has a hole without him.
Diego Martin	I love Johnny but the video felt short of portraying the hurt he was attempting to pass on given his past and/or current path of life and the deeds that came with having to live his life and the sacrifices it comes with. I deeply feel the loss of his loved ones but what about the ones he didn't want to share. The editing could have been better.
Spiceyywhitee	This reminds me of every colter wall song
Jacockis Titsworth	"Even though I produce hip hop beats, Cash is nothing to compare to.

R.I.P. Legend"
Tim Hackney	Not many songs out there that can be this powerful without drums
Christopher Washburn	My grandfather passed recently. This song so reminds me of him.
Jun Kitami	The end of the line for a rebel rocker. Wife dies before him and being able to see that he's near the pearly gates too, this song does hit the soul hard like a 150t train hitting you at Mach 1.
Mike Stewart	This isn't my life. I've always played it safe. So why does it resonate? I've played it safe, but stuff happens, and you don't get old without regrets. Maybe it's time's way of getting you ready to let go.  (The video adds so much to an already magnificent performance of a great song.)
Galang Lingga	who fucking disliked this video.
Samantha Sterling	I wrote this song samantha Sterling is my name and they stole my writing Johnny was God watching you should see that and I'm his daughter and he did this for me the Messiah that's right he was God and I thr Messiah wrote this song that's gold Ricky Nelson sons in 9 inch nails and his daughters stole my writing to Ricky kidnapped and sold me shot my dad cause Ricky touched me when I was 4 there you've been called out by the Messiah mother of christ
heinz stalder	The reeal Love, we are by use self.

Aztecgod Huzluiospd	"My great grandfather passed away recently

Edgar Villagme	*It is surprising, because life is too much*, ❤ so I was just on my computer, trying to get out to live on what I love, music, and within that time, I did not even realize how my thoughts and feelings were They scrambled, making me come here, where you are today too, where I come every time I'm wrong, where I come when I see my art and my music and think about my future, well let me tell you that you can take the time to be sad, but you have to go on, do you love something? I do music and not just make it, because when I listen to this piece it fills me with overwhelmingly beautiful feelings, so you can feel what others and understand what Jonny cash says, so that you appreciate your life more and move forward, we can improve, let's go , we can - Edgar villagme

Zetetick	"For Johnny Cash to cover a Nine Inch Nails song (!)  is one heck of a far out left-field idea!  
....Turns out it was also truly inspired.   
This song was *made* to be sung by this man,  and at this time in his life........Simple _perfection,_      it _bleeds_ Humanity."
Whag Fruit	"I apologize for the inconvenience, this is not your intended destination, a user by the name of ""Clarence"" has interrupted the puzzle, and so I will be leading you through the next few phases, sorry again."

SNES drunk	This is the kind of video where you close the tab and think about what you've seen. And as good as the song is, I credit the editing just as much. There's so much to digest from Johnny Cash's career as a public figure. This is brilliant work. Thank you
James gaming Channel	He did have a point tho as you get older so does your feelings as well as no matter how famous you are sooner or later it will become dirt or a memory

Miles Claussen	A true inspiration, my dad who passed away showed me Ring of Fire when I was 6 and I fell in love with this man and his music, my dad started his own band because of this god of a man.

DA ICEBRG OFFICIAL PAGE	I KNO IM A MAN OF COLOR BUT I LUV THIS SONG. 💯💯💯💯💯
Mitch Varnadore	Who after 40 has not reflected like this? You visit where you grew up, you look through the dirty window pane. Gazing at the floors, walls and empty space, are the memories still in the house, just your mind or in both? The realization hits you, the key board, the book cover, the curtain and the lid closes on us all. Eventually.

M R	Sometimes in life we believe that materialistic things, our jobs, our status makes what life is... but all too often do we all forget even me that it is the ones we love, our family, who we take care of, people in general the beautiful memories, Taking care of what is so precious to us that deserve our attention more... sadly we are stuck, so so stuck in our ways as a society.. Politics, money, greed, our goal wealth beyond measure, power over others... missing the love other people in all that.. yep a empire of dirt this could not have been said better.. regret is a massive thing when you get older I feel it now in my 30's it is a pain no one can describe a pain that you would probably rather have half your body cut off then feel... Love is everything always remember that because without that you are bankrupt.... just bankrupt..
wikilix	If you don't see Jesus when close your eyes while listening this song, then it's not for you really...
MrBadintentionss	"i employed a 'cuddlist' yesterday, and i did it because i suffered terrible abuse as a child and as a result, i find it impossible to make meaningful connections with people - because i'm use to people pushing me away since i was a child.
everything was fine, until she had to leave...
i'm really despairing right now, and my life is truly on the line, because this is the first time in years i've taken a chance on someone and invited them into my life, who wasn't a shrink, counsellor or doctor.
i'm a good man, but i'm a good man who has a lot of demons.
the 'cuddlist' doesn't understand my history of course, but man i'm despairing...
i really am."

It's me, I'm the former IV drug user."
Aj Dominguez	What gets me is that nod at 3:05. That cinematic shot from June to him is like he nodded to her. That he let's her down.

Sc0pe Faith	To everyone that's struggling with whatever demons you have. Shit is real and fuck what people think you know what you feel. And to the people that won't help us even when we've asked a thousand times. I hope that one day something changes and you'll see that every thing is not about the fame it just makes you rich so you can fuck up even more. Only a few are able to pull out of it and then they only have they're empire of dirt and pain that's a burden until we die. And to all the people who shamelessly look at someone and think your above them, fuck you! You use it in a toilet just like me.
Евгений Мычка	Покойся с миром Джони , нам тебя будет не хватать но ты останешься на всегда в музыке
Clifford Richards	Theres only one way you could of really appreciated this song... you had that hit, and hopefully you seen the light and realise its a ONE off hit ..... you chase it for the rest of your life..... there is no better hit on earth but there is no worse pain either, coz looking for that first hit again you lose EVERYTHING....It never happens again but you still look for it .... that magical place that keeps you warm.......this is just my opinion but ive been there and now thankfully have given up looking.... hope you do too xx
Maykyane Silva	🇧🇷😢
Brad Beck	"Redemption and forgiveness  is what is offered through Jesus. We all struggle., I have asked myself ""What have I become my dearest Friend"".... in my later years knowing the potential I had in my younger years.....What have I done to make things better? What have I done to give God glory?  I feel empty even though I believe and try we must keep the faith..Its hard but that was the gift given to us."
Halbe Hageman	Last time I listened to this song was with my mother, only four months ago. She was 85 and knew what mr. Cash meant. She passed away on december 12, 2020, and I listened again with tears in my eyes this time.

Владимир Кочубей	Можно и не переводить...
Alfie	My dad just passed away on december 30th of 2020. He was only 44. Just when I thought the year couldn't have gotten worse. This song fits him very well from his pov. Not in such a large scale as cash. Fun fact: dad's name was also Johnny and cash was his favorite artist ever. I just cry everytime I watch this video because I just see dad in those old clips, it sounds really weird ik lol

And now he realizes it , yet to late so now he realizes that the fame and fortune , wasn't worth it , it is all about being there for and with your family..... God will always be there for u , yet the Devil will as well..... i write music for artists for years .... yet i have sold ny soul as well and can relate..... knowledge is a beautiful thing yet .... it can also destroy the ones that u love u the most as well.....

Shooting Relaxing Music	"Hey you. Yes, you. You're probably scrolling through the comments, like I am, reading all these motivational comments. If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don't stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don't dwell on things from the past, don't stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. 
For me, imma wake up tomorrow morning, maybe get some exercise and do some videos for my YouTube channel, while I wait for school to start. I think it's pretty boring because of coronavirus, but I know it'll end eventually, and things will start to brighten up. Have a wonderful New Year and remember, you are the best!🔥 Stay safe, and take a chill pill - Relaxing Music for Ambient 👍"

SPENCE GAMING	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Fordock	eu nao sei porque , mas quando tudo parece se encaminhar bem eu me saboto , eu sei dos meus defeitos e acabo sempre errando dnv , sei oq fazer e não fazer e acabo sempre no mesmo ciclo me sabotando ... e eu n consigo saber o porque , perdi amores , amigos , parentes ... porque eu sempre erro eu so to cansado disso , to cansado de tentar e sempre fracassar , eu n sei porque n consigo ser alguem melhor ... eu tento eu juro q tento e acabo sempre errando .. eu as vezes penso so em desistir ..

Forthepeople 2	"I see comments on johnnys version and on nine inch nails version and they feel like they have to pick which is better. I can relate to both. I have been a fan of both for decades. I understand nin version because I use to stick the needle in my arm for years. I felt the loneliness, the desperation, the feeling lost.
I was lucky I quit.
Now that I've gotten older. I feel the johnny version. I look at things differently. I have lost family. Lost friends. You start to realize time is running out and no matter what material things you have, you can't go back in time. You start to feel that loneliness, the being lost and the desperation again.
The best advice I can give anyone is to live a good life. Love your family and friends. Do things with them while you can, because time will go by fast and you will be left with a lot of ""i wish I would have done this or thats"". Tell them you love them. 
 BE happy for what you have."

lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"* ***Urgent, read this!*** * Trump has opened the way for death by firing squad, electrocution, poison gas, to the already used lethal injections, for Americans after December 24.  Hitler powers.  Get the facts as to what is going on.  Alex Jones has been saying Americans are fat and stupid, but it is you Alex, that are stupid. You are trying to get Bill Gates killed, by your lies, just as you have done to other people.  Saying Bill Gates is going to force a vaccine on America.  Trump has been the one behind the vaccine(operation warp speed), where he will have the military administer a forced vaccination to all Americans in 24 hours, by General Gustav Perna.   In Canada it is Major General Dany Fortin, that will vaccinate Canadians.  The military is dealing with corona virus in UK(Britain).  In Australia they have supposedly only 8 cases of corona virus, and armed military is forcing quarantine, including armed checkpoints.   In Canada, Randy Hillier(not the General doing forced vaccinations) revealed the Canadian Government's concentration camp plans(through the Government's own documents), Government falsifying of Corona virus numbers and falsification of the hospital numbers, was fired retroactively it seems.  He made the statements in 2020, but there is information spreading that he was let go in 2018.  There is a cover up going on.  It is not Antifa doing this to the world, but your long ruling suppressors.  Read on!  Alex Jones is trying to tear down those trying to make you free, and others who's businesses jeopardise Trump/ AlexJones/ Big business/ Government/ Pope fortunes.  They are systematically destroying people and businesses.  Alex is Trumps militia leader and propaganda man.  (youtube.com/watchv=1wACJloXiBo) (youtube.com/watch?v=yPl_YA4IBO8) (youtube.com/watch?v=JEEt-t3F_ac ). Look at what happened at UC California, when they were trying to find and kill me.  That should wake people up to the reality of what is happening. Trump can make the economy perform well, by guting safety, the environment, and stripping the poor, but in the long run chaos.  The great reset was supposed to be the setting up of a system, where the people of earth, would share in the proffits of the world, with a 24 hour work week, and a highly productive society, where every single person on earth has property to build a home.  The great reset is where society stops recognizing people who follow satanic organizations that enslave people.  Mankind is willing to over look their evils of the past, done in ignorance, if they turn to doing good.  Hence the name, the great reset.  If these evil suppressors don't change, then they will be considered outcasts of humanity(that is where their weeping and nashing of teeth will be).  They will have brought it upon themselves.  Don't talk to or listen to them, basically have no dealings with them.  By being against God, they have made themselves enemies of humanity.  These people would not be killed, but just be outcasts, but they are trying to kill all people who might prevent them from continuing their reign of terror.  There are people spreading fraud, that no one will own any thing, which is absolutely ridiculous.  It was supposed to be a system of equalisation, but the Royals and government fat cats, have turned it in to terror, extermination and condensation of power.  The false systems know they are a fraud, so they have resorted to killing, to suppressing freedom, just like they always do.  Most people are not violent like they are, so people do not know what to do to counter their terror, when they control most aspects of life.  They want to bring us back to the past, where they controlled all things.  The Pope of Rome, runs the Vatican City State, which actually is a Country.  He has his own flag, and crown, in fact he has a tripple tiered crown, which is on the Country's flag.  The triple tiered crown, which is on the flag has 666 written in Latin, on it.  The Pope is the ruler of the City above the Kings of the earth, mentioned in Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions there, that they are clothed in scarlet(Catholic Cardinals) and purple(Catholic Bishops).  It mentions, that in this Church Empire alliance, is found the blood of the prophets, holy ones, and all slaughtered from the earth.  The way to defeat them is for every one to tell hundreds of people about the fraud until every one knows.  They also know this, that is why they keep locking people down, and then going in and slaughtering the people who know.  People through out history have been such cowards, that the system has been able to keep going, unhindered, although many people were oblivious(they had no idea what was really happening in order to act) to what was happening.  Don't raise up your weapons, but raise up your voice.  A good idea to have a weapon to defend your self though.  The Roman Papal system killed the people of the Americas, those during World War Two, Rwanda, Asia, every slaughter on earth.  The people could stop it all in one day by working together.  England is part of the Roman Empire, but it pretends to have parted ways.  This is a false reality.  The Magna Carta treaty, proves that the Pope controls the nations of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, England, others and the Countries these nations conquered.   Their ""mark"" usually hangs from their necks, flags, shields and it symbolizes their religious political system.  Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18 calls it the Church riding the Roman Empire(Roman Catholic Church, and daughter religions).  The Bible says, that they force people to worship and accept the mark of the Empire/Church, or be put to death.  From around the year 538 Rome had decread the death penalty, for any one observing the Biblical Passover, or Sabbath.  Just as the Bible had said, but the time period for that ended 1260 years later at the French Revolution, and birth of the US, just as the Bible had said.  That's when the control of the Empire shifted from Rome to Constantinople(now Istanbul Turkey).  In 1929 Lateran Treaty, Catholic leader Mussolini restored the Papal State of Rome Italy, which was the death blow recovery mentioned in the Bible.  Revelation and Daniel fortold these things(Daniel12:4, 1Peter1:12)  The cross or X symbolizes the belief system of Rome.  The crossing of truth with error.  It symbolizes the 10 nations that originally made up the Empire.  X in Latin means ten.  Daniel 2:44 mentions 10 kingdoms being destroyed by God's Kingdom.  The Pope is the master of puppets, pulling the strings. (Pay attention to the lyrics(youtube.com/watch?v=0obBdrfUMzU))  Alex Jones, has already called for the mass execution of American citizens.  ( youtube.com/watch?v=sos2d7gtq20). God created man to live for ever, in peace and happiness, and he will return that to mankind.  Prince Charles is talking about going to war, to seize control.  He is not wanting to set up God's Kingdom on earth.  He has been very happy, living off the people's money, and keeping them suppressed and in darkness.  If every one on earth shared the earth's profits, and had their own property and house, this world would see a peace and prosperity like never before.  Prince Charles talks about a marshal plan.(marshal law). Magna Carta, talks about how to deal with people waking up.  It says to take away all their freedoms, so they can not even leave their houses.  Then the Pope will compensate them for their extermination of the people.  If only there were some people, who were not so lazy, that they would look in to things, for the sake of their offspring.  Should I quit telling you about these things?  God says that no coward will inherit God's Kingdom.  It must be very difficult for people to just say, I don't care if they rape and steal and kill, I'm too much of a coward to do any thing.  All you have to do is every one tell every one else, until all people know.  Do it very quickly, and then they will not be able to kill, like they are doing under the guise of a corona virus, like they did under the guise of a typhus virus during World War Two.  They exterminated over 12000000 then, and the Pope, had said there would be over 13000000 million exterminated in the US alone and maybe more now.  Catholic Adolf Hitler used pellets of Zychlon B, which turned in to a deadly gas, that would suffocate people, when exposed to air.  They would also put an exhaust pipe in to people's windows, or pick people up for quarantine with a truck, that the vehicle's exhaust would go in to the passenger area, killing or causing breathing problems.  Are you willing to do the research, and use your voice to make people know the truth?  The Bible says, you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.  The Bible also talks about the Kingdoms of the world becoming the Kingdoms of God.  Imagine every one on earth being an equal, home owning, productive person.  It's only greed that keeps this from happening.  The Bible, refers to the Church riding the Roman Empire (Roman Catholic Church) as being responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  Time to make a real change, and not slaughter, in the name of a Church, that God says is fake.  Trump sent a cure, earlier in the year to Brazil, and soon after they were having mass graves of 20 000+.  America never had a cure at that time, so what did Trump send there?  A health expert said that people were dying from the cure.  German(Nazi) BioNtech has vaccine for the military to exterminate you.  Locking of people down in groups, can not be justified moraly or legaly, only sick people need to be isolated, in a real case scenario.  Read the book of Esther of the Bible.  When you go to testing area, no phones allowed, why? Military nurses end your life, no witnesses.  Flu like symptoms come from being radiated.

lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"****Urgent*** (youtube.com/watchv=1wACJloXiBo)  Here's why this is happening!   In Trump's America you go to prison for 10 years for killing a (Exodus20:4) statue, but for killing a Black person you go free.  This is the man who says, that he has done more for Blacks than any President.  That would imply that no President has done any thing, as justice should be the very lowest form of support, which Trump has brought zero justice for them.  America, please keep reading to see, what I am talking about!  This is what is happening in America?  It seams to be under attack by the Roman Catholic Church.  There was a man shot, who some say, that the man attacked Police, but I say where did you get your video of the Philadelphia shooting, because the one I seen, the guy never attacked the Police?  Two Police officers shot him from over 10 feet away.  He wasn't even facing their direction.  Is Trump who he claims to be?  Remember Herod, the Roman Governor of Judah at the time of Jesus.  He was restoring the Temple of his day, but when he heard of the Messiah's soon arrival, he had all the children in that area 2 years and under put to death.  The Roman Empire is a master at deception.  Please keep reading to learn more!  Antifa means anti Fascists.  The Fascists are those people like Hitler, and Mussolini, which directly killed 12,000,000 human beings and 60,000,000+ through their war.  Fascism is the joining of government with fake religion. Where they exterminate people.  Antifa opposes the extermination of people. Trump is an unbelievable tyrant.  We seen George Floyd get suffocated by 3 Police officers, Jacob Blake shot unarmed in the back, a Black woman shot through a window by Police while she was playing video games with her nephew, and many more killings by Police of unarmed people.  The person shot this time was 10 feet away from apparently full grown men with guns, so why could they not have subdued him with out killing him.  Why be so quick to shoot for one thing?  Why not use the baton to knock out the knife, if he had one. He was not charging at them.  They could have shot him in the shoulder.  This could be a Trump staged event, as he is a tyrant.  There is a fake video that shows him swiping at the Police, but what really happened was, when the Police fired all those bullets(5-8?)he dropped down to the ground.  This could be like the German kid(Kyle Rittenhouse)( YouTube.com/watch?v=rqSjCtOPY8I ) Trump sent in to kill in Kenosha, to cover up the killing of Jacob Blake, so that people will associate the violence to the wrong group.  Kyle was sent by the police to Kenosha to kill some one, so as to create a smoke screen for the killing of Jacob Blake.  The police throw the semi automatic rifle holding group some  bottles of water from a Police armored vehicle, including Kyle.  The Police thank them for coming.  Kyle doning his blue latex gloves(same gloves the Police use when they kill) kills a person, after the armed group tells people to quit filming.  Kyle runs from there after calling to say he killed.  He runs to the group of armored police vehicles two blocks away,  but not before killing an other man who tried to stop him because of the first killing, and shot a third person also, blowing half his bicep completely off.  Kyle walked right by the Police armored vehicles still carrying his semi automatic rifle and left the state, even though the police must have heard all the shots, and people yelling to them, this is the guy who shot all those people.  Police are not that stupid, evil but not stupid.  This was a staged event.  The blue latex gloves show the premeditation.  The armed group told people to turn off their cameras(this is on video).  This is the Pope waging war on you America.  This was to make you hate Antifa and BLM.  Some one from media should ask Trump, why Antifa has been labeled a terrorist organization!  Was it because they shot these three people.  It would have been.  The Pope has a Greek false prophetess falsly prophesying your destruction .  There is also a so called Christian prophet who prophesied (announced the planned pandemic) before it happened, also says that democrates will disappear after the election.  They are telling what they are doing, in advance.  The Roman empire still exists today.  It is controlled by a religious leader, the Pope.  He is the man sitting in the Temple(false temple), who is the King above the Kings of the earth of Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 of the Bible.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State.  That is the only place in the world with a King ruling over a city, and definitely the only one ruling over nation states.   He controls the Empire, including Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Britain, Turkey, and Italy, along with the territories they conquered.  There was 10 kings before and will or already is 10 kings again.  Although the prophecy of Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 belongs to the Papal false religious system that rides the Roman Empire, it tries to make America to think it is you.  Trump is working with Rome, to destroy it's enemies around the world.  Rome was responsible for the Nazi holocaust of world war two, by two Catholics Hitler and Mussolini.  Hitler used a fake typhus epidemic to round up people in to concentration camps, and extermination camps, but before that he smashed, burned, looted and destroyed businesses.  Today the same things are going on, accept it is a Corona virus, and it is different people's livelihoods that are being destroyed.  Alex Jones is an other participant.  He has already falsely called for on many many occasions, for the killing of people, and is a lap dog of Trump, where Trump can do any thing and get away with it.  So much for Alex being a champion of truth.  He had a reporter at the Kenosha protest, and knows what went down there with Kyle.  He is totally compromised.  Alex Jones now calling for the mass killing of Americans, and asking Trump to issue mass death warrants.  Alex Jones is complaining about Hollywood being full of pediphiles, when actually it is the Catholic Church, that is full of them.  Hollywood made a documentary on it, so that is why they are attacking Hollywood.  There was over 90 little boys molested by Catholic Priests, in (one) city alone.  This false Church/Empire are responsible for all slaughters on earth.  Revelation/Apocalypse18 near the end says, in her was found the blood of the prophets(John the Baptist beheaded by the Roman governor of Judea, Herod), Holy ones(all through history, including Jesus(crucified), and all those exterminated from the earth(Jews and others WW2, Rwanda, slaughter of the Americas, etc...).   Another extermination like during world war two is going on right now.  A false Christian prophet foretold the pandemic in advance, and the disappearing of the Democratic party, but now says, that plague is not the answer, but to start praying for famine, and here is the video (youtube.com/watch?v=HIKOXyxlhag)  Does this mean, because I exposed the fake pandemic, that now they are switching to famine as the attack.  Keep reading!  Over 2,000,000 acres of America has burned, cities have been wiped from existence.  America, you are in a war right now, and your current President has betrayed you.  Was ""Operation Dark Winter"" the training manual for this global war of the Church, on the truth.  ""Operation Dark Winter"" was a training scenario of an epidemic, and all the results of it.  The German Nazis would stick an automobile exhaust hose in your home's window, or pick people up for quarantine with a truck, which had the engine exhaust going in to the back, where the people were.  The Nazis also used Zychlon B gas(which I think was hydrogen sulfide pellets, which became an odorless gas, when exposed to air), which would suffocate people(sound familiar? same symptoms as corona virus).  Today people are being radiated, with electromagnetic radiation.  It  can leave you short of breath, your stomach swells, and your brain swells and becomes sore and hot, and your muscles can twitch.  Look in to what a Faraday cage does, to get some relief.  There is a continuous hissing sound.  I noticed they start radiating about a half hour after your light and TV go off, so they have some way of determining that(coloberators?).  There is also a type of weapon that can make your heart palpate funny, like you are going to have a heart attack(an upside down pot over your heart can stop that).  Some people will have not even known this was happening while you sleep, but you would be getting run down and irritable.  The German Nazis would cremate the bodies, which I know is going on in NewYork state, and Italy at least.  The Bible mentions that Jesus's(Yeshua's) followers sold all their possessions, and had all things in common.  This is a form of communism.  The false church hates it and wages war against it, and that is why Trump is trying to start a war against Russia and China.  People of earth must resist tyranny where ever it appears.  There is a self described Christian leader Kevin Zadai, who says, that Christians are very powerful, and he invites his (YouTube.com/watch?v=puiMoHT5Vt8) followers to join him and Trump, as they do a historic cleansing.  The police took part in rounding people up for Hitler, and they can be seen as not very people friendly.(they get paid by the state)  It is not just Blacks being killed, but Whites and minorities as well.  Watch, ""Will Trump Bring About Genocide And World War"" parts 1 and 2.  I pray that America will not be a coward like Germany was, as no coward will inherit God's Kingdom. America, world, we are fighting for our lives. I believe that people go for tests because of being radiated, and then military nurses, put them to death.  People never find out what happens.  No phones allowed in testing area.  Welcome to 1984,  Genocide happening now! ** * * *(**youtube.com/watch?v=8VFngRmp1HE)******* ***"

He wants to start again with being truly happy, and will give away his empire of dirt so he could be happy with what truly makes people happy, having good health, and having a good family. Enjoy what you got, not what u could have. He knows that having stuff dont matter, people go away in the end. Be happy with them and cherish them, and dont go after money and wealth when the real wealth comes from being with family and friends.

Alvin Lederer	"My friend Henry Vaccaro was one of Johnny's Pallbearers. Henry's Family and Johnny's Family were close and the Boys still are today. They fished in Bimini the same time I did and went to the same places and knew the same people I did but our paths never passed. I have henry's book signed and inscribed to me along with private photo's that are not in the book. The link for the Book is below. I still morn the loss of June & Johnny Cash and Pray for the Cash & Carter Families. I was devastated by the fire of Johnny's home and I have face many of the demons that Johnny faced and like June, my better half & the Good Lord stayed by my side and saved me. They believed in me when I didn't believe in myself.
God Bless Y'all

RollingStone	"This is the perfect song to explain how America feels right now. Destroying one of the last free countries, for the foreign ties of money. I volunteered to serve in Bosnia before I finished boot camp for the US ARMY shortly after I graduated high school.  I joined only under the contract that I would be deployed directly after completion of training to assist in the peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The US military was implemented in the role of stifling out the horrific genocide that occurred in that country, only after NATO and ALL foreign governments and their diplomats refused to allow our involvement nor give any assistance toward their struggle. Their reasoning;"" Bosnia did not have financial assets that could attribute toward the other countries needs."" (i.e. oil, trade needs, minerals : metals, rare wood, precious stones....exec..) The US procures most of our wooden material needs from Canada (85% of Canadian profit is wood) while Precious stones, like the rest of the world are from the African and Asian continents.  Oil; middle eastern African continent.  Only after American military reconnaissance teams stumbled upon mass grave sites that consisted of HUNDREDS of innocent women and children, they defied orders and got involved. Forcing our Generals and Admirals to support their efforts. We cared and we fought for them because NOONE else would. And we did it because it was the ""right"" thing to do. Now years later, our government doesn't care about what is right or wrong. They care about how much money and power they can attain in ""their lifetime"" during ""their reign"" and nothing more. So like I said; Johnny Cash explains it best; We are no longer a Nation of the Free, (we're censored, free speech gone- voting, free and fair election, gone. freedom of religion & Right to worship, gone. - The right to bare arms, protect yourself and property...they're slowly being taken away and eventually will be gone.)…. & it continues... we are just a nation who will slowly and most definitely hurt, because of our new political leadership. Now while we fall back into poverty, unemployment & struggle. Not only will we HURT, but unfortunately the world around us, who may once again need us, will HURT as well."
Omega Owl	Johnny Cash is one of my best friends favorite musical artist, he lost his mother a few months back and I haven't talked to him in awhile, but that's all I wanted to say.
Justa Guy	Johnny cash was a rock for me when I need to hear it and to have him adapt while he could and to see him work so hard in his golden years teaches me I too can be who I want I can walk the path of success and so can you if you let yourself he had a hell and we all do and one day we will heal people want us too so we will to make them smile again to protect that ray of sunshine that moves us to act
RollingStone	"After Johnny covered this song by Trent Reznor. Trent said;"" Wow....Johnny, I believe I wrote this song just for you and didn't even know it?  It was most definitely meant for you to sing to the world. """
MUSIC CREATORS	Doesn't matter how much material you have bcuz it is left behind when we die and the pain sits with just memories left from your dead loved ones but what matters most is how you live with those around u till the day u drop

i respect johnny cash for all of the memories he brought me. rest in peace 🤍"

ᛋᛚᛟᚨᚾ ᛋᛚᛟᚨᚾ	I think he's referring to his age and dealing with the regrets and chances he never took.  Maybe he was not the best person to his family and now they are all gone. He's realizing that money ain't shit but family is everything.

Azguard Mike 2013	when I self harm and people ask why, i send them here. I feel dead inside and dont feel anything emotionally, the only thing that does feel real is cutting my arms. All my friends got their girls pregnant by college and left, my family are either dead or have learning difficulties. I have to work 5 days a week, my money just sits in the bank while i sit in my flat. I tell everyone im happy and living the dream, but really im just lying. While everyone else moves on and is happy with their kids and wives and friends, im sat here feeling like i let people down for being depressed. So i cut myself and feel relief that their is a feeling, and that feeling is the real hurt and pain of blade slicing flesh.

Rockin WS6	I met Johnny Cash in 1969 at a concert, I was 14. I shook his hand and he said a few words to me. I watched him sing and blow on his harmonica bigger than life, quite a experience as this was my 1st ever concert. Its been on my mind all these years. Now I face diabetes problems like he did and have been thinking the things in this song. Today I stumbled onto this video and song for the 1st time. I didn't know it existed. Says it all, we are all connected in the end to the same fate. We are all going to meet someplace, I hope its a better place than this where we all get along and get to love without hate.

He wanted to come clean for whatever he had in his mind. We as men have to tell the truth and be as honest as we can be. There's no shame in crying, there's no shame in regreting. Love for what you have, and give it all you have.

Kory Schroeder	Love the way Johnny Cash was able to take a song written by someone else, that is so personal and raw to that person, and not only reinvent it, but seemingly derive his own personal relationship to the piece.  Truly a master of the art.
Shane Ruddock	People forget he covered this song never wrote it it's raw but it's a tribute to the original

The Boho Chocobo	"My favorite thing about this song is that the original artists, NIN, were like, ""nah, that's HIS song now. Not ours. It's was waiting for him."" and left it at that. He definitely brings this song to another level with it's meaning. It is truly his song now and that is one of the most wonderful things about it. It embodies the struggle of a man who was on top of the world and had everything he could ever want  but still felt like he had nothing and only hurt everyone around him. It's beautiful and heart breaking all in one masterpiece."

Max Demp	It's just a peaceful protest just like the previous Antifa and BLM protests..  right     People are very very angry.. have been for years... Whether or not Trump is put back in office,  the anger will not go away. People do not like their liberty threatened and this is a small overfill of that anger. Now if the people involved are Antifa,  that still does not reduce the feeling of anger towards those responsible.

To see if I still feel

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

lily	this is the only song that really hurts me
Keldor D'Antrell	From my perusal of the comments it seems that no one has given any credit to the director and editor of the video.  There's no question that much of the power of this song comes from the images that underscore the lyrics.  Perhaps the greatest triumph however *is* the fact that so few have noticed their work.

Reuben Corrales	"That was a beautiful song. You made a grown man like I left in tears.
Rest in peace to Johnny Cash. His death came months after his beloved second wife June Carter Cash passed away. 
Always remember that she freed him from his drug addiction and brought him close to the faith by taking him to church.
And, never forget that Johnny proposed to June in front of a live audience - She said ""yes"" and the crowd rose up in a standing ovation with a loud applause.
Check out the movie titled ""Walk the Line"" for more."

Nataniel Dormu	I've listened to this song many times for the last few years, but today when it played again on my playlist I realized that I never watched the music video for it. I always thought the song was really sad and touching, and knew it was from his last album before death. Now watching the video for the first time I legit almost cried like a baby. It really feels like an end to his life.

Amy Quinn	I remember when my mother died, and not long after my father did, and then a few years later my partner John also died. I was so lost and alone! But this song helped.
Angie Pants	Lost my dad unexpectedly over the summer. He adored Johnny Cash. We played a few of his songs at the visitation; I'm not sure when or if I'll be able to listen to any of them again. This song is somehow even more devastating now.
Meme master 69	Something about this song makes me want to listen to it every night before I got to bed I just think Johnny cash is one of the better musicians out there one of the best.This song is a mix of making you feel sad but you still feel passionate about listening to this song because you come back everyday to listen to this song and that’s what Johnny cash is good at making you come back to listen to the song and listen that why he will be the best.rip Johnny Cash.

Kai Wilson	Unpopular opinion, but here we go. I like Trent Reznors version better, while I do enjoy this song and feel it captures alot of emotion and just generally represents cash in later years. I prefer NIN version more because the melodies and vocal performance capture a different sort of feeling that I feel is a lot more impactful and unique. I still love this song though, I highly recommend listening to the original version from nine inch nails if you haven't already heard it. Please don't turn this comment section into a war zone please :)

Rotten Cheese	You know something, I’ve never had a song or movie make me cry, but this song it brings you to the reality of the world, it made me cry because of the truth behind it. Everyone leaves eventually whether you like it or not, it’s sad, and until I listened to this song and watched this video it never fully crossed my mind just how meaningful this song is, and how meaningful it is to spend time with others and cherish what you have, don’t be upset with what you don’t have make what you have the best thing in the world.
howling spirit	r.i.p johnny cash, you will be missed but your songs will stay forever
Matthew Mcneil	I personally prefer trents version but this is so much more emotional
Candace Heinemann	i could not watch    I cried     miss you sweet soul Johnny
Keep It Real Outdoors	The people who disliked this piece of artistry have no idea what it's like to have a soul. God bless Johnny Cash, and god bless the men and women he touched with each and every piece of music he sang or wrote.
Helen	That was hard to watch. I could feel the hurt and pain in his voice, see it in his eyes. It goes to show that you can have all the material things this world offers but when the spirit is broken, it never ends. Johnny Cash was my dad's favorite, I can still here my dad whistle like a train while he was shaving from 1 of Johnny's songs. I miss my dad and I miss all the great people that are leaving this world.  I just hope that there is a better place for all of us when we pass. I can see my dad sitting with Johnny Cash singing together and laughing together.  Rest in peace Johnny, June and my dad that I miss terribly.

4 Pots Lite	"I’ve commented about the montage sequence on a few reaction vids but wanted to post my thoughts here and see if others had similar epiphanies. 
For me this is an editing and performance masterpiece. 
At the beginning we are shown footage of Johnny laughing, enjoying playing the engineer in his locomotive...he’s in the drivers seat....later we see more footage of the train but now it’s just the runaway engine, no driver, barreling down the track. As the montage sequence moves faster and faster in time to that one haunting piano key reaching a crescendo, it represented (for me) the realization that Cash was carried away in the current of his life...no longer in control, at the mercy of his demons....a literal and figurative flood of everything swept away, including his boyhood home as the area was flooded to bring electric power to the region. The whole sequence is one big flood....of sound, of images receding into the past, of regret and loss, not only of places and people in his life, but more importantly, loss of himself. I think it’s Cash’s final understanding of having lost HIMSELF in the pursuit of things that didn’t matter,  that pours out of his soul and all over this performance. I think it’s the reason why so many ppl are overwhelmed when they hear this. 
The story isn’t about Cash growing old and coming to the end of his life, but about the shame and regret over the choices he made. The loss he feels is sad enough but the true overwhelming tragedy is being a witness to Cash’s realization that much of it was of his own making. 
Its an apology. It’s a eulogy. Its a warning. It’s a final cry of understanding too late the consequences of one’s actions. It’s gut wrenching and I am in complete awe that he was brave enough to lay this out there in full view."
Donald Cole	How real this song is in all honesty in my opinion and I have my very own drug addiction since the early 2000's so I kinda know what the fuck i am saying here ppl and I'm sending my love up to heaven up above to the man in black and his lovely wife June

KeeperOfTheFate	Once, a philosophy teacher told me that the older we get, the more we, our bodies get acustomed to the idea of death. We start to look on our life, get retrospective, etc. Although, I'm still to far from it, I feel that this song is a retrospective of long life full of difficoult choices.

hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
jer j	One of my favorite songs, but man, Johnny and his Missus were pretty bad actors
Zokambaa	jesus.. I heard this song when NIN did it but didn't think that much of it... but when Johnny covered it, it made the song so very real...   I no longer can imagine this song being done by NIN... this song and video became Johnny's when he did it...he did it some serious justice that I've not seen another artist do since....   same as Disturbed doing the Sound of Silence... I no longer can see that as a Simon & Garfunkle song... so amazing, my brain no longer accepts the original...  that said they did a great version.... but holy hell... Disturbed tore one off when they did it

Roberth Pilesund	I think why this song, from JC´s lips affect us so much, is it´s honesty. When young, we blame others and ignore our faults, when older, we wise up with regrets and if possible apologize to those we hurt. Usually older people doesn´t lie, not because they are unable, but they know the costs of selfishness and dishonesty.

His manager suggested that he cover this song (originally done by NIN) and he just absolutely killing it! He only changed one word in this song from the original! He changed “I wear this crown of shit” to “I wear this crown of thorns”. 

Then later in an interview Trent Reznor stated how weird it was to hear a song he knows he wrote, to sound so amazing and so original as cash made this."

jamin ilsley	Yes everyone does go away in the end
jamin ilsley	This is one try song it hits home pretty hard
Judy McGaugh	This does seem like the end of a life. But it shows so much history of that life that I continue to watch it over and over. But in this video we do not just say goodbyes to one person we said goodbyes to two. June was such a large part of Johnny. You can not think of one without the other. I have never heard the NIN VERSION OF THIS SONG. I guess I would rather think of it as Johnny's song, and do not want to realize that it did not start out that way. So in the end we run thru Johnny's life and his ups and downs, then he sung about hurting himself to see if he could really feel, seemed like it was something he had really done in his life, that he was in that space where you want to know whats real or did you imagine it because of the abuse you were putting your body thru. He was replaying those parts of his life, and reopening scars that he still thought about. Then the last of tge video with June by his side, you could see the sadness in her eyes over knowing their times here was ending. She always let her man shine  tho. They both had their own demons and this song was meant to bring closure ...RIP JUNE AND JOHNNY CASH....

Chris	"You are a mist...""Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”  Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.  Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”  As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.  If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them."" James 4:13-17"

I have done that before and it did hurt, now I feel nothing except a tiny sting. I was told I will be in a wheelchair by 50 by 3 different surgeons,  I guess they were right dammit. Well at least maybe my back will stop hurting so bad, I kind of doubt it though"

Ghirahime	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Vortex	In the end, it's just a matter of perspective because he's sad that his life and the lives of his friends will end, but he could also be glad that he had a life with good friends in the first place and even if there is no afterlife, then it would just mean that death redeems you from everything good but also everything bad that happened in your life, as if the word death was synonymous with redeemer. I know he had a hard life and yes, it could have been better, but it could have been much worse. He really had a talent as an artist, but the problem I see is that he focuses on the bad things. Is it causing unnecessary depression or am I just being too emotional? What do you guys think? Am I just extremely stupid or is/was he too negative or both?

KH4444444444N	Its like an acid trip tertiary reversal. Sign of our times. Johnny Cash does a cover of a NIN song when his own discography is replete with hits that run deep and still cool as fuck, yet the original Video and song by NIN has 2 million views while Johnny Cashs remix has 76 million, while Johnny's own discography mostly hovers close to 1 million. It shows how painfully influenced the viewership and consumers are for immediately looking up a recommened cause or song of the moment and not ever diving deeper. Sheeple af. Someobe if fucking laughing at you low energy, soulless shells of Human beings. Empty.

Braxten Pierce	I love johnny cash
Miguel Galarza	This video resonates Johnny Cash's life and legacy. I can't say this is how everyone sees their legacy but the entire song his him stating his guilt and regret and whether if he had the choice to do it all again, would he? Not sure... but ultimately he says the most important thing in life is your family. Sure everyone goes away eventually but did fame and money change him for who he was? I know this is a cover and really not his words but you hear it in his voice how he makes the lyrics his own and he tells the story of his life. Its why this video is so powerful. It hits hard and even though Trent Reznor wrote this song, its the way Johnny Cash did this song and made the words speak from his heart and from his soul. May he rest in peace. I think he knew the time was near and its probably why the video was made like it was.

Kokonaz	"hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?

Leandro Elnaggar	"There's not a single time I come to this song that I don't cry like a child. This song is just so much; a swan song, a last goodbye, a wrap up, despite the fact I was unaware of Johnny Cash prior to this I can feel every ounce of his pain, how he might have felt during his final days, how everyone around him when he was growing up is no longer there, how he knows he won't last much longer and that his life is sniffing away.

Death is certainly quite frightening to me at my current age, but somehow this song makes me feel... ready for some ominous reason."

She was healthy and full of life. Found her unresponsive on our couch. We don't do drugs, lived healthy lives. God just needed her in heaven I guess.

David Hilliard	In his life, Johnny Cash was a musical outlaw, then a bunch of Hollywood fakes tried to turn him into a MOR edgy artist. Rock N Roll has taken him back.
Animant	can't wait to turn 60 and comeback here again...
J T	Recently I had to amend my list.  This is the most beautiful and haunting song I've ever heard.  Even more so that my grandpa recently passed away.  Had been married for 60 years.. hope at the end he never felt this way but just glad my grandma was with him.  This became 10x more powerful after that, I'm in my 30s and the first death I've ever been through, remembering anyway.  Wish I'd never had my first beer, and drifting away into something that meant nothing instead of being closer with my family.  Remember folks, stay away from alcohol and drugs because you could get so caught up in yourself for so long.. when or if you're able to overcome you missed out on everything that meant something.
Amity Vanhoose	The people who dislike this video dislike my comment but Johnny Cash is my favorite singer and like this if he is too he made great music me and my dad always listen to him we are his biggest fans I'm sad that he passed away 🇺🇲😢

Dmitry P	Замечательная песня.  Оказывается у нас одинаковые ценности в завершении жизненного пути..... Никто не вспоминает что пил, ел и как красиво жил. Все вспоминают как мало путешествовали, и как/почему мало любили...... Мудрость отодвинулось на несколько десятилетий, несмотря на акселерацию новых поколений. Всё смазано переходным периодом, разбавлено наставлениями и сдобрено потреблением. Получаем кашу. А в итоге -  What have I become?....
NastTheMetalhead	I am a huge fan of metal music but this is a song i really appreciate not because it is very good musically but because i actually can feel the lyrics. Being someone who actually is trying to always be a good person and is also a sensitive character gets hurt by people. Also Johnny Cash said sometimes : i have two personalities. People who have lost themselves and try to fight again to be what they truly are and for being good people in life can identify with the song. It's a song about every real human that has their values as a goal of life and try to be better every day.
Juan Mosquera	I love

MattyC	“What have I become, my sweetest friend?” this hits hard
ZFR Music	This song is better than the NIN original because the words were literal and real at the moment for Cash. Reznor was only around 30 when he wrote the song, and tho he struggled with opiate addiction, he still had a life ahead of him. Cash did NOT!!
Mark Cranston	to all those people who are pointing out that Cash didn't write this. That may be so, but he made it - like Amy Winehouse singing 'Valerie', and Cash may be singing to his wife even though he didn't write the lyrics, once you play a song, it's yours, if you're good enough - music can't be owned.

Loko_Dragon27	This song, is just so amazing. And its like as if i can feel Jc's pain and regret that he carried with him his whole life. The ups and the downs, the pain and the broken heart, saddness and tears. I feel it all Sir Johnny Cash. And this is by far the most powerful song ive ever heard. R.i.P Sir Johnny Cash.

Pablo Molina	El es leyenda
bfeezey	Oh my god...
Crunchy red leaf	"I feel like this cover was not just his  goodbye to the world but also a letter to musicians who look up to him. While many look up to him and his accomplishments he does not pride himself in them as they do not prevent the inevitable which is death. I feel as if the lyrics ""You could have it all, my empire of dirt"" is him telling musicians ""Sure you could be a famous musician just like me but as you get older and see your friends and family go you'll realize it won't mean much."" With the following line being ""I will let you down, I will make you hurt""  is basically him saying ""I know i seem like some legend to you but you must realize i'm just like any other man and I'll die like any other man."" I know this most likely isn't the case but its just how I always interpreted it."
doublekrack	dont know why .. but this make me cry...
catchytunes	One lesson John taught us is do what you love as long as you can and want to. I love how he kept going as he got older.
John Brannan	Love this version, thinks it his emotional attachment to it that makes it better imo.. See it time and time again with some songs imo, I think the original is good, but the minute someone emotionally attaches themselves they show it when singing it... One for example is Labarynths Jealous, absolutely love that song, but theres a guy that done an audition on xfactor a few years ago and he sung it as it reminded him of his best friend that passed away.. The raw emotion he sung it in was astounding, I had goosebumps. Thought he was going to win it, but as he went through and started singing songs that were picked for him, he never had the attachment to it so fell away... Sorry for the paragraph😂😂
Jessica thrasher	Wonderful

Jennifer Cleveland	"The white house he's at in this video is where he lived as a child in Dyess, Arkansas.  His brother Jack died there after a sawmill accident.  It was also the inspiration for his song ""Five Feet High and Rising."" Lots of raw emotion in this video. And probably some of the last footage of either.  Johnny Cash closing the piano feels like he's closing his own casket.  One of the greats."

Rebecca Tudor	I grew up listening to  him as a child and then stopped listening as a teenager and young adult. Now many years later, I appreciate him so much as an artist and a man. His version of this NIN song hits so deeply. He knew how to capture our emotions and put them to song. What a wonderful man.
Tejas Gundapaneni	I feel so bad :((
cpecpecpe	I have been fighting a series of medical issues, emergency spinal surgery, advanced regionally metastatic cancer and now an unrelated brain tumor.  Jonny Cash’s cover of this song struck a cord. While it deals with end of life issues and the mistakes we all make in our lives it gave me hope and the strength to fight. The world is a better place because Jonny and June were here. They are helping people deal with hard issues to this day. God bless them both❤️🙏

ScipioHun	"I am Hungarian, I am living thousands of miles away from the US, and I have nothing to do with country music. But this one is not just a song from a genre, it is much more. It's the nicest farewell I have ever heared. So much regret, so much pain in just a few lines.

If someone collects the most important songs from the history of mankind, I would include this gem."

АЛЕКСАНДР ДЕМЧЕНКО	"Good afternoon, I would like to speak out because I am emotionally broken, you can read maybe not read your right.  Although it doesn't matter to me what you understand from this and what you say ...
  For a long time I like my classmate girl.  With whom I talked for a long time but never asked on a date because she was busy.  Once my old friend whom I know from the age of 4, as always, invited me to take a walk in Kiev, he wanted to come to our class because it was after the lessons, we then took another one with us, but he separated from the team for a 3-kilometer walk under the pretext that he  it's time but that's not the point.  When he came, she hugged him and after a couple of days she added him as a friend on Instagram.  We both realized that she was in love with him, we did not remember it for so long until he asked for a favor.
  By the way, she also talked to me a lot up to this moment.
  He asked me to help invite her for a walk ... He supported me a lot throughout my life, so I weighed everything and agreed, hoping that this would be at least one good deed that I did in my life.
  He asked me for advice before each message to her, and I?  And what could I do, creaking my soul, supported my old friend simply from the kindness of my soul.  I gave him the best I could, and just as well I could use those words myself.  They all worked out using my words, partly word for word as I dictated.  Everything worked out for them and this Sunday they are going on a date and I cannot finally realize what I did.  I did not participate in this love triangle because in it I wanted to lose rather than win.  Did I do the right thing? ...
  Shall I say what I think about what happened?
  I knew it would hurt, but not that much.  I hope I did the right thing ..."

CamDaKill	I heard this song from the Logan trailer and I kept hearing it in a lot of places and I didn’t even know it was made by Johnny Cash, my mom loves Johnny Cash and my middle name is Cash from his last name, Cameron Cash Corbett, now this song is stuck in my head, people always thought my middle name meant like money and stuff since it’s Cash which I don’t like when people say that,  always think about Johnny Cash when I hear my middle name and stuff, I’m going to start to listen to more of his music like my mom did, this song is great!

Ben Rogers	11 months clean from heroin, two years off OxyContin and also off fentanyl- I’m on methadone but still have a physical dependency to fentanyl as my inner voice in my mind got quieter and quieter until now where it’s almost silent! This song just gives me chills as I’ve got no endorphins!
Lee Eatmon	"i wonder, when he says ""everyone goes away"", was he thinking of June, his wife?  She died shortly after this song.  He passed away shortly after.  I feel he was saying goodbye to his beloved wife, June.  June was an incredibly talented woman, ...you tube shows several videos of her in her youth during her popularity.......she had wit, she enjoyed fun, she was  a talented country and western singer,  and of course she had the physical beauty.  More importantly,she was also a descendant of the original country and western musicians of that era.  See Maybelle Carter, Junes mom........these were the country and western women of an era now gone."

Mino Tec	Johnny had in old age everything a person can have. Respect and never forget.
Shar Jones	Trent's original version is of the pain of a young man at his worst, Cash's version is a beautiful story of a old man who lived a full life and even through the all the hurt he has experienced, he knows there is better on the other side of the end. ❤
Bsnsnsns Nsnsn	Good shit
Rick no reddit	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Stephan Höser	"(With my greatest respect to this old master of freedom).

Hurt (Verletzt) - Johnny Cash (Deutsch, mit einer gewissen Freiheit der Wortfindung.)

Ich habe mich heute verletzt,
will sehen, ob ich noch fühle,
konzentriere mich auf den Schmerz,
das einzige, was zählt.

Die Nadel sticht die Haut,
der alte vertraute Schmerz,
versuche alles zu verneinen,
aber ich erinnere mich an alles.

Was bin ich jetzt,
mein süßer alter Freund,
jeder, den ich kannte,
verklang in der Zeit letzendlich.

Und du könntest alles haben,
mein Königreich aus Schmerz und Schmutz.
Ich werde dich im Stich lassen,
werde dich verletzen.

Ich trage diese Dornenkrone,
Auf dem Stuhl des Lügners,
voller gebrochener Gedanken,
die ich nicht reparieren kann.

Hinter dem Schild der Zeit,
ändern sich Gefühle,
du bist jetzt jemand anderes.
Aber ich bin immer noch hier.

Was ist aus mir geworden?
Mein süßester Freund
Jeder, den ich kannte,
ging am Ende davon.

Und du kannst alles haben,
mein Königreich aus Schmutz,
Denn ich werde dich verlassen,
...werde dich verletzen.

Wenn ich nochmal beginnen könnte,
eine Million Meilen von hier,
ich würde zu mir stehen,
ich würde den Weg finden.

(Mit meiner größten Hochachtung vor diesem alten Meister der Freiheit.)

But in the end, he really had nothing at all. In fact; God owns everything. The things we seem to own
are only out on loan until He takes it all back. When they say, ""You can't take it with you"", they
aren't kidding. I believe this is what Johnny was saying here in a nutshell."

Julius Walker	Anyone who have love ones that suffer for some type of addiction. This song is their voice. If your ever able to catch them at the right time and can get a real conversation they all say the same thing they would give anything to start over again. They lost everyone they love and friend do to lies due to their addiction and if you know like I know  smh the LIES take there toll. Pray for them

Markcy1989	One of most saddest song by Johnny Cash for sure. I cried hearing it and remembering my dad, he used to love Johnny Cash's songs.
Chrono Red	I came back to see if I still feel....I still do.
Craig	He became aware at the end of awareness to the point of questioning his life, he questioned it in such ways he realised how insignificant it was. This song for me is him asking what life would have been if he had chosen a different way. If he could start again, he would find a way. Such truth and soul in one mans end is priceless.

Kevin Wilson	Probably the best cover of a song ever recorded
Tim Anderson	It's a 10! I was turned on to it after reading about Rick Rubin's most meaningful songs. Johnny put his whole soul into the songs he sang, even if he was persuaded to do it. It's a crusher!

doug w	one word. unreal
Running Soulja	The Real version of this song was never a hit because a song has to be from someone who has lived the life of the song and Cash put his soul in it and exposed all his feelings of this world. Nothing he had meant nothing to him but the loved ones he's loved and all his mattiral things meant nothing, that is what makes a hit and the original person couldn't make u feel the song, but cash did and really made u believe that was really him saying this to u and really money, fame, everything he did and said, he would have traded it all to do it over again because he'd change it all and he seemed like he meant those words, Cash could really be the only one who could make u believe it was him and u  know u don't have that much time to live, none of it means nothing without the ones you love, everything else is just something but he made that movie of christ and put it in the video because he wanted u to know, his sins were forgiving

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Dazza_Bo	This video was shot in February 2003. Everyone remember this video because it portrays Cash's long fulfilled life and just how old and fragile he was shooting this video. He passed away just 7 months later. But what a lot of people don't realise is that his wife, who is looking over lovingly at him several times in this video, actually passed away just 3 months later, several months before her husband.

Michael Summar	"One Nation Under God makes our nation a religious establishment. The stars in the flag represent our republic. They are all white because of our religion and its order. 14th Amendment violates the 1st amendment as it is a law concerning a religious establishment and its practice. Congress shall not and cannot make any law concerning a religious establishment or any law hindering its practice. This makes the 14th Amendment Federally unlawful and unconstitutional. It overthrows the founding principles of our forefathers, it overthrows the constitution of the United States of America and it overthrows the supreme court decision of 1866 Dredd Scott decision, it overthrows our religion and its practice as well as all our founding laws and statutes.

The Christian Religion and its practice:

Jews: Gods chosen people.
They speak Hebrew.
Law of God: 
1)A matter must be established based upon two or more witnesses.
2) The bride shall resemble the husband 
3) The life of the flesh is in the blood
4) Believers are as salt and light
5) Salt and light are white
6) Black equals darkness and is defined as the absence of light
7) God created light and saw that it was good and divided the light from the darkness. The law and practice of segregation is and was established by God.
8) White declared believers
9) Blacks declared unbelievers
10) Whosever believes in the Lord and is baptized is saved and whosoever believes not is doomed.
11) There is no darkness in Christ
12) He is without spot or blemish 
13) Satan has no place in Christ
Establishing a religious establishment after the law if God.
1)Bride must resemble the husband
2)A nation under God means his bride which is the Church
Since the bride must resemble the husband then we build America in his likeness. First we must establish his likeness based upon witnesses and testimony.
1st witness) Words of King Solomon the Son of King David. Jesus is called Son of David so these are the words of Jesus. ""I am swarthy by reason of the sun and my beloved (wife) is white so by his law he declares that he is white for the bride resembles the husband.
2nd witnesses) The flag of Israel stating the bloodline and flesh of King David. The flag is made of blue stripes that make the Star of David. The Star of David is imposed onto a white background. The law states that the life of the flesh is in the blood, the blue stripes are the bloodline and the white background is the flesh. The flag stands for the flesh and blood of King David so therefore again Jesus is without argument white. Jesus is also a jew so this also declares Jews to be white people. These white jews are the nation of Israel and are also America.
3rd witness) Jesus sent as the Lamb of God. Lambs are white but swarthy.
4th witness) The pure white dove symbolic of the Holy Spirit. Christ is born of the Holy Spirit therefore is born pure white like that of a dove.
5th witness) The jewish prayershawl which states the flesh and blood of King David, Jesus and the Jews. The prayershawl is fashioned by Gods word and commandment to be made of pure white wool with blue stripes.

America established as a religious nation called church as one nation under God.
1st witness) The all white cabinet members of our founding forefathers stating ""We the people of the United States of America.""
2nd witness) The flag as a symbol of our republic. The stars represent the states which are the people of the United states of America. They are all white, no there is not one black or mixed racial ethnicity. The star is a Christian symbol as it is the opposite of the sigil for the devil which is an inverted star that forms the image of a goat. The goats are used in Christian religion to symbolize the devil and his a gels that will be destroyed. The stars symbolic of Christian's and the people of the United states of America comprise and make up what is called the Puritan Church. The flag also states that we are a Pentecostal Church as the red stripes stand for the shed blood and the white stripes stand for the lamb. This is called Pentecost which is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit by Christ and his atonement at Calvary. That makes the flag and it's people the Holy Spirit. Whosoever sins or speaks against the Holy Spirit is endanger of hellfire and cannot be forgiven.
3rd witness) The White House as a symbol of our nation. The White House or the House of White people.
4th Witness) The word of our judicial court decisions that you must be white in order to have citizenship. This follows Gods law that you must believe a d be baptized to have citizenship in Christ and belief is denoted by white flesh.
5th Witness) Our Supreme Court decision, Dredd Scott decision of 1866 ruling that blacks cannot have citizenship by any means. This includes by means of the 14th Amendment which is Federally unlawful therefore the Supreme Court decision still stands.

An all white nation Under God is a religious practice and establishment. It is also the Civil and Human rights of a human being to have and live in such a place if he enters through Christ as  a believer. Since blacks don't have citizenship by the Supreme Court decision and by God's law and ruling that there is no darkness in him then blacks don't have Civil rights. Gods law warned them thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife or any of thy neighbors things. It does not belong to them. They have violated our civil and human rights and they say that we violated theirs. They don't have any rights here as the flag tells them every day they have no place here"
Ben Dingens	Nonono. We are all wearing these crowns of shit, not of thornes.
Brandon Cox	There is something so terribly heart breaking about listening to someone who affected the lives of so many people give their last song to the world and have it be full of regret. I have just come upon this and needless to say within the first couple lines I was tearing up.

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?

John T	I'm sorry, I can't believe its been two years since we been together. I miss you so fucking much and you moved on. I'm writing this because I need it out. I feel like screaming into the void but unfortunately all I can manage is a whisper. Caroline you were the best girlfriend I ever had and not a day goes by where you dont cross my mind. I been sleeping a lot lately because in my dreams we are still together. I'm sorry I walked away, had I been more intelligent I wouldn't have let what we had die. I hope that reincarnation is real, I will find you in the next life and this time I'll make it right. I hope when you see how I am living you can forgive me and I hope you are happy.

Vau Bao	Wow.
Giuseppe Iovinella	Don't know why, but it's like I'm not alone, not anymore.
RA JO	The idea that Rubin had to record these covers in the last years of Cash’s life was a stroke of brilliance.  Then again he was working a lifetime of genius in Johnny and so it was bound to resonate with anyone who’s lived life fully.  The look on June’s face brings tears: a deep and abiding love and understanding of the man who was her other half.  And I agree with others who’ve posted that he died ultimately of a broken heart.

Antu Das	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Just Another Being	I was raised with his songs, and with Waylon and loretta, its sad how loretta is the only one standing, our last queen of country beside patsy, ❤ country is not the same without them, the country we have now feels different and weird, old country music feel more lively and is meaningful and holds great stories like this singer Johnny Cash singing to this song. Read in peace..

Jesse Bessette	This video made him epic to other gens., it also touched me in a special place. My dad listened to him and i also used to hear him on the radio. To hear him in this, touches me, and not in a gay way. It makes me feel as though death, is a thing, and it does come for everyone.

rxdawg75	"""And you  could have it all, My empire of dirt"" Powerful words, sung in such a powerful way......"
inordirection	"Trent Reznor on Cash's cover (2004): 

""Rick Rubin has been a friend for a long time, and he called me asking how I felt about Johnny covering 'Hurt.' I was flattered, but frankly, the idea sounded a bit gimmicky to me. I really didn't put much thought into it, as I was working on something at the time and was distracted. A few weeks later, a CD shows up with the track. Again, I'm in the middle of something and put it on and give it a cursory listen. It sounded... weird to me. That song in particular was straight from my soul, and it felt very strange hearing the highly identifiable voice of Johnny Cash singing it. It was a good version, and I certainly wasn't cringing or anything, but it felt like I was watching my girlfriend fuck somebody else. Or something like that. Anyway, a few weeks later, a videotape shows up with Mark Romanek's video on it. It's morning; I'm in the studio in New Orleans working on Zack De La Rocha's record with him; I pop the video in, and... wow. Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore. Then it all made sense to me. It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. Some-fucking-how that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning: different, but every bit as pure. Things felt even stranger when he passed away. The song's purpose shifted again. It's incredibly flattering as a writer to have your song chosen by someone who's a great writer and a great artist."""
Nathaniel Vandenbrink	Love and miss you Nana <3
ugsisr	Johnny Cash did Trent Reznors song justice... Gave it meaning

Phil Blagden	Best cover song ever. Most poignant anyway. We all suffer loss and have regrets and pain. Often times pain can teach you more than a pleasant memory. It can certainly leave a more lasting impression. God knows our pain and Jesus suffered death on a cross to redeem even the most broken and sinful. Johnny believed in Jesus too. RIP.

UNFORGIVEN FOREVER	When you lay beneath the stars in the mountains  in late fall early winter , do it in peace , the monsters you fear will never kill you in the forest but they will kill you  in the  daily  dispare you live in this horrible world of man ! I SHOULD HAVE LEFT THIS WORLD S0 MANY TIMES NOW , I Am here for a reason  , this vessel my soul travels in is not mine and no matter how many times I want to end it I cant ,I am on a one way ticket that has been purchased  by my Creator . It sucks I cant check out when I want but  I HAVE ENJOYED THE RIDE , the benefit of this all has been I welcome death  And have no fear of what or what is not to come ...

Stlth x	Offends when you put to think that you're almost a child respecting the age of this man. But hurts the fact that you won't live to his age. All crash. My mind hurts. My pain hurts. I put to wonder what I've done wrong. All I've fought. All for finish sick. A sick young-adult. Sick on body, sick on mind. Sick of life. But when comes the day when I cut this pain forever?

Joe Irvine	Johnny took that song and gave it a lifetime's worth of hopes, dreams, loss, despair and grief. My eyes always are wet when I even think of it.
Cameron Conner	I never realized how actually good he was for his age 😮
Timothy Wells	7 time
MagikoMaiko	I disliked the video because I disliked the fact that this legend is now gone. But i also liked it because he went out like a champ.
Kumbra	What a masterpiece! From my perspective Johnny regres some of his actions as many of us. Loosing fight with our own demons and knowing it's only our fault it's not easy. His friend is most likely him at young age, perspective, life full of opportunities. And you choose drugs, alcohol or whatever and waste so many beautiful things in life. But that's all part of this journey I think 😊
Björn Stöbbauer	not from this world
Lisa Rosado	I like Johnny Cash,Now that I am older and can appreciate his name.
Joshua Ashley	RIP AGP
Erno Pakarinen	This song tells everything about his life. Well not everything, but it tells a lot. I wish he had lived longer but I guess our age catches us all. God bless!
Kirsti DiChiara	Live Love Laugh and all the Pain in between
Evan Sanchez	"It’s amazing that years and years later this song and video are still capable of leveling so many people emotionally (myself included). Truly a testament to the power of art.

I really hope people are capable of treating the NIN original as a separate artwork. Hurt is the last song on NIN’s album, The Downward Spiral. It concluded a semi-autobiographical concept album about a person’s descent into madness and suicide and contains huge themes of alienation, isolation, anger, self-loathing,  addiction, and  spiritual turmoil. The context that Hurt was written in and the larger body of work it was included in are fundamentally different than the artistic statement that was made by Cash and the video director here.

Both are valid. Both are poignant and hugely impactful. Both have their place."

theContainer &theContents	All tares and demons are sentenced to perdition by the authority of the holy spirit and Creator.  All tares, every last one of you, whenever the Creator wants, instantly, and soon, you will be cast into the abyss. There, you will be in utter darkness, and in a state of total delirium. You'll be confused, nauseous, dizzy, feel painfully sick, and your logic and ability to perceive left from right, up from down, won't work anymore. That's because the grace of the Creator which gave you those abilities will be forever gone at that point, much like your free will already is gone now as you serve the satanic hive mind and are a slave to it. There's no time in perdition, so your time there will never end. There is no where you can go in the abyss, because everywhere you walk melts away or circles back on itself. You'll hear the wailings of other tares in there with you, but you won't be able to find them. Sleep is impossible, so is eating or drinking. And yet you'll feel those urges to do those things just as you did in this life.

adrian	"Os dias estão tristes, a cada dia  eu lembro dela na calada da noite, aquelas curvas sensuais e aqueles labios perfeitos, Mas nada e para sempre, Provavelmente se alguem ver esse Comentario e esteja na mesma situação que a minha, Não desista...
Eu não aguento mais viver nesse mundo, Brigas familiares e sem nenhum motivo para estar vivo, o meu unico motivo se foi a tempos, Eu queria poder Guardar memorias, Queria poder voltar no Tempo e fazer coisas que eu poderia ter feito e não fiz[...]
Eu sei que isso parece  frescura, Mas não é.
Meus Amigos desapareceram, Todas as noites Eu choro... Lembro dos Velhos tempos, tempos que nunca mais voltarão.
Eu sinto muito sua falta marcela, Os dias eram mais Coloridos quando voce estava aqui."

Ph Ter	"J'ai entendu cette chanson pour la première fois la semaine dernière et j'ai été touché en plein cœur.
Et même si sur le moment je n'ai pas compris les paroles, j'ai ressenti de la tristesse et de la mélancolie je me suis retenu de pleurer car j'étais au travail.
Cette chanson est resté dans ma tête jusqu'à ce que je trouve son chanteur... ca n'a pas suffit j'ai voulu en savoir plus encore....merci Wikipedia !
Je ne connaissais pas vraiment Johnny Cash, je suis né en 1983 et ce n'est pas ma génération ni mon style de musique.
Cette chanson est le reflets d'une vie.
Une vie que n'importe quel homme aurait pu vivre, je pense que c'est pour cela qu'elle touche autant les gens."
Zeszyt100k	As you pass the elderly person, think about what story it might be hiding. Dramas, tragedy, maybe nothing ? . Let's respect older people, even if they are not pleasant to receive, because maybe they are tired of everything they have experienced. ? :(

Sat Yuga	"[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

In few scenes June appears on the stairs next to Cash. Director said that he filmed her because she had that anxious, sad look on her face. Little did he know that hers expression was caused by diagnosis that she got the day before filming the video. She had some kind of leaking in her heart valve. Nobody knew that neither Johnny. She eventually died soon."

May your children learn to do good and repent. May our sins not hinder us. Let us be different, let us grow and be challenged, to make a difference on this earth. To whomever reads this. Learn to love hard people, and learn to forgive hard and stubborn people. Start this morning with God, with friends and family and learn to live without regrets

Saurabh S	What I love about this song is the last line (I would keep myself, I would find a way), it can be interpreted in both ways. Johnny cash sings it in a more pessimistic tone, he’d find a way to ruin things even if he got a second chance whereas Trent Reznor sings it, longing for a second chance. I think this speaks volumes for the impact our individual journeys has on our perceptions.
Esteban YT	A man who lived his life we will be like that someday so make the best and most of it remember you not the only one more are like you .

Twinkle Twinkle	I grew up hearing my parents listen to Johnny Cash late intothe night when they were having a few drinks and reminiscing about Ireland.  I remember the first time my Dad played the Live at San Quentin album and explained about the prisoners cheering for Johnny and June. My  parents gre up in rural Ireland and were immigrants toughing it out in London in the 70's.  I'll never forget those days, listening to a recipe of Country and Western and Irish music: Johnny, Hank Williams, the Dubliners... I may not have always appreciated my parents taste in music but all these years later I can't help but yearn for those nights with that ol' record player blaring away.  I miss you both x

Justin DC	"IF Johnny Believed that JESUS CHRIST died for his sins, was buried and raised again for His justification then Johnny's soul is in Heaven!

Joh 11:25  Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 

All have sinned and come short of the Glory of God.
God sent forth His one and only begotten Son to died on a rugged cross for the sins or the WHOLE WORLD.
2Co 5:21  For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 

Receive the free gift of righteous, which is the free gift of Salvation, which God imputes to your sinful account to saved your soul and give you hope in Him by the resurrection from the dead!

Receiving is Believing, believe the Gospel of your salvation today and thou shalt be saved.

1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 
1Co 15:5  And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 
1Co 15:6  After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."

J Robinson	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hold
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt

I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt

I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again

A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
J.L. Salayao	"May you rest in peace Mr. Johnny Cash...

Apart from God, we can never have hope for the future and strength for challenging times. Our earthly wealth and accomplishments are good, but will not give us lasting joy and peace because things can be taken away from us or health issues will bring us to our knees. Also, people we love will die sooner or later and some people will betray us down the road. We can only have hope for the future, strength to endure tough times, and lasting joy no matter what our circumstances in life through Jesus Christ. If you receive Him as your Lord and Savior. If you confess all your sin before Him, He will surely forgive you and give you a new life. In Him there is  hope for the future, strength to endure, and lasting peace and joy with all His blessings and protections to you from danger."

Deeper than the ocean
Or any rocky crevice
No matter how grand
And the cuts I’ve received 
A salve for all the pains
He saves me from hurt
I could fall to the bottom
Then dig a little deeper
There they are
Waiting
At my lowest
God is nearest 

Thank you for carrying me through all of these Hurts"

Michael	"I have always been a huge nine inch nails fan from the early 90s.
But I never thought that Trent renzner wrote this song.
Until I heard the interview with Trent reznor saying that this song is not his anymore!
He wrote it while renting the house Sharon Tate was murderer in by the Manson clan the word pig written in blood was still on the door underneath the paint.
Trent said he could see it and he wrote this song down in a little journal.
But after hearing Johnny Cash sing it he realized that it wasn't his song anymore that pain belonged to Johnny Cash! 🙏🤟 #Amazing #SwanSong #RIP"

Kroger Toaster	I feel like the music video adds to the emotion in his voice a man looking on his past seeing it all slip away. It all becoming decrepit and falling apart his vocals failing at times it makes this the best cover song a cover all other covers should strive to be. May the man in black rest in peace knowing he has accomplished something that most musicians can't replicate.

Camil	"I first listened to this song when my grandpa died, I’ve never lost a family member, and truthfully we were never that close. I was diagnosed with depression 6 years ago, and something about listening to this song while crying in the car with my dad just felt too real. I didn’t know who this song was referring to until just now, and that makes things even more profound for me, as someone who’s greatest fear is hurting those she loves.

Truly one of my favorite songs ever."

Reid Kyrzyk	Although there is pain in his voice, it’s really sad to think what he went through not long after this video: losing the one true love of his life.
Isaac A.	This song was my karma when I was depressed, searching for encouragement to suicide or mutilation years ago. Nowadays, it's increasingly becoming again
Shazznuts	This song and video hits so well on how life is so short even if you’ve grown old and want to live forever. Johnny’s even telling you to realise it’s okay to have priceless material but you can’t take it with you when you die. It will soon be useless in the end, so he wants you to use your time wisely to continue loving your family. “By the time you figure out how life works, you’re already too old.” It’s such a sad song. His voice says it all.

Moshe D. Guerrero	"Lyrics:
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all

I will let you down
I will make you hurt

It's interesting, whenever I hear this song my mind says don't listen to it, it will get you cry, however, I need to hear it, it reminds me that there's nothing bad in feeling sad or emotional, still shows that we're alive and human, which get's harder every day.

Allef Alves	"One of the greatest songs of all time. I swear to myself a long ago: ""Hurt will be the first song that I will learn on guitar"", and today I back here to say: *I got it*

This song makes me sad and happy at the same time, and Johnny Cash was the number one"
Devan HB	"[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here


[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Wayne Feller	Lord, I need you.
Champagne	I have listened to his songs over the years and this one stopped me cold, like when the power goes out! John Cash was a gifted man.
Nayr Tnartsipac	The original is way better. This is a self absorbed and  self aggrandized version of the original. The song is about wanting to die and getting everyone you love to go away so you don't have to watch them suffer from your failure and despair.
Spoolverine	It’s been 3 years gramps R.I.P. 🕊

ALAIN DUCLOS	Johnny Cash nous a laissé une pièce de musique phénoménale avant de nous quitté, il a laissé sa marque profonde par son émotion et son talent incroyable, son âme restera parmi nous pour l éternité, Johnny Cash R.I.P.
David Geier	With all the reactions I have seen and read about Johnny Cash's rendition of Hurt, there's no one that seems to get it! This is not only a video about a man facing his inevitable death, but it's a warning to others to seek  and Love God with all your heart, mind, soul and might and love your neighbor as yourself. With the images of the portrayal of Christ and him Crucified interspersed with images of his life and work , Johnny Cash's rendition of Hurt is a kind of self application of the book of Ecclesiastes, the vanity of  doing things in this life with all your might and pursuit of wealth is all being naught in the end, and that Christ's sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin and living a life according to the bible is all that truly matters.
Arman Shahinyan	"Rest In Peace!
I also recommend the remix by Bastian Le Bel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUGUqoieeac"
DesertPackrat	He touches our souls with each word sung. There were many things he was and many things he wasn’t, but in the end there is truth in his life and his art.

Fredrik Jonsson	shadowlands release on Kazzak EU
MuralTurnip 2770	Johnny cash was good I wish I could have met him
Gwenns Place.	I think it’s excellent. I think it’s the most emotionally accurate song I could think of. In Johnny’s day? We had good music, cash, and freedom. Now we have bad music, no cash, and no freedom.

Mattia Migliarino	LEGEND!
Dennis Acklin	He's still singing for all of us, it looks clearer when you hit 70.   🙏
SheyD78	So powerful, so emotional. He made a lot of music, but this may be his finest piece. For the thoughts it evokes, for the memories it brings, for the roads not taken or the roads you wished you never took. The sum of human triumph and misery in a single song. Be better for having listened to it. Best wishes to you all!
Grace Walker	This song still hits hard
ferrer65	Is it just me or did Johnny Cash make a mint covering other people's music?
SoSa Boi	Its been 2 days since i smoked crack. thank you Jesus 🙏

i was at a lan party and all of us were playing C&C Red Alert 2. We had MTV playing in the background and then out of the sudden this song was playing. 
Its in my memory because everyone of us immediatley stopped playing and was listening to this masterpiece.
after it was over we continued playing recognizing that some of us were in the middle of a battle but none of us were paying attention"

Paul Walker	Heavy
Itz Slyakz	God, I miss him.
Mark Taylor	Johnny Cash is saying in this song that a lot of his life was wasted. He didn't have Jesus until later on. He loved Christ passionately. He was saved. His empire of dirt is everything outside of Christ. He admitted he was a sinner. We all are.  He is with the Lord and has been. He is saying Jesus will not let you down but Johhny was saying he himself let others and himself down just like we all have. Without Jesus in your heart, you are separated from God. Eternity is rapidly approaching. Jesus is coming soon. Today is Nov. 22, 2020. It's almost over.

bellaimages	"DO NOT TAKE YOUR GIFT OF LIFE FOR GRANTED!
Johnny & June ... they had a love that was undeniable. Their souls were one. When she died, he died with her .. that is why we have ""Hurt"" ...
I remember Johnny Cash! I remember growing up as a child with my parents watching the Johnny Cash Show. My dad listened to country and I was listening to the Beatles, but this man's voice caused me to listen!   My dad grew old, sick and died, so did my mom.  Soon I will grow old, sick and die too.  We are all only here for a short while.  We all hurt. Life always hurts, but then there are great moments of joy and happiness in life.  Make the best of it!"

Steven David	Miss the man in black, good family  friend, fellow illuminati
lp_lux	This music just makes me feel emotional, it just makes me feel like what it would feel like if my family and friends never existed and it was just me all alone and lonely with no one to help me with my anxiety and depression, I just wanna say this because I’m in the middle of a best friend breakup right now and it’s really difficult having to cope with it especially when it’s reminding my loneliness before I met my best friends, maybe I’ll forget about this and come to terms with it before my birthday that is coming in less then 3 months but still I feel like a failure and guilty because I feel like there was a way I could’ve prevented it from happening and songs like this can help me cope with it... I just need time to think about this before the time comes to say our final goodbyes which is happening on my birthday... really hope my other friends and my family can help me calm down about this... I’m just glad I’m not alone

The Tune Raider	"""My Empire of DIRT"" by a man whos name was CASH: 
For me, this says it all about being sucked into the material world of ""success"" with deluded promises of safety, happiness and bliss: 

If you want to know what to expect in life; expect suffering, confusion, self doubt and disappointment, next to fleeting moments of real happiness through actual achievements: 


You cant have one thing without experiencing the other though: Enjoy. Cash is Legend:"

locotypas	"lyrics

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hold
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

lovephillies1	I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Cash following a concert when I was in college. My wife's father was a big shot and arrange for the university concerts. When I met the Legend he was down to earth and humble to a fault. I was young and stupid. And after our brief conversation I whispered to my girlfriend that he didn't have any shoes on. I must have been overheard because he went behind a curtain and put his boots on. I've felt like a real jerk ever time I hear Mr. Cash's music and I apologize.

[DARKLEGION]	The thought of losing my loved ones through out the times until im all alone still hurts my chest to think about... And this music perfectly summarized it all... life, sorrow, and death.

Whidbey Hiker	Since my wife died a month ago music has been the needle tearing the hole. I don't know why I do this to myself.
WK N	I'm a long time fan. I just look up his music to hear him from time to time. I won't buy it. I want to feel the same way every time I hear it, and if I had it I would play it too much and ruin the feeling when I either run into it or encounter a mood when I need it. He is a Legend!
Zipfel Klatscher	why nobody understands what he's saying. everyone celebrates him. and nobody understands what he wants to say

Also, this is one of the very few cover songs I've shed a tear over..... I'm fine most of the way through the song until the scene with his wife from around 2:32 and I can't explain why it gets me every time"

MARCANTONIO NUNNARI	"w..                                                          All together, including the children, we pass to the Eternal Father !!!Indications for the treatment * www.padreceleste.com Dear brothers! I take this opportunity to offer you mutual and collective cooperation through prayer, let me explain it right away: together with some of you, I formed a prayer group called ""ReteTrinità"", which consists of a community of universal brotherhood based on love of God the Father. Every evening after lunch or before going to bed, we hold prayers in each of the houses with other participants scattered around different parts of the world. The prayer takes place on the knees and with the union of the hands, starting moderately with Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; (Importantly ... we do not share our hands, because the Eternal communicates with the soul and we lose contact.) The moment we begin to pray, we may be disturbed by external forces, such as thoughts, useless things, delirium and much other . another. everything leaves the prayers, because even if we wanted to find something, it would be impossible to do, so we will start with a greeting addressed to God and with the phrase ""Hello, God ..""; Immediately, there is a message about the problems that concern us, asking for help from the Eternal. Our prayer group draws from the church three main prayers, pater, ave and gloria (the simplest and best known by people) and offers them the opportunity to speak with God in the family, where you can talk about everything with the Almighty, from small everyday 
things to serious problems, in a word, true 360 degree dialogue. Between one joke and the other, and at the end of the conversation, it is necessary to repeat once Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; Therefore, praying together, the presence of God is present simultaneously in all hearts, and this facilitates His intervention. Having benefited, it was decided to repeat the morning and / or afternoon prayers. Obviously, if your daily duties do not allow you to pray in the morning or in the afternoon, do not worry: you can transfer it to another hour of the day, the Eternal understands and knows why you are doing it. However, it is important that the evening prayer be performed without fail. I guarantee you the absolute benefit of the method used so far and I assure you that dialogue with the Almighty frees the soul from pollution and brings peace and prosperity. I express my most sincere congratulations on my behalf and on behalf of the other brothers in the prayer group, hoping to be more numerous. a hug Marcantonio I received this teaching of prayer in a social network from a girl, who advised me to read it carefully, not to delete it, to offer it to the family and to give it to friends, because it will be appreciated better than any good food, as it is useful to improve the soul! he sent it to make God known 

The sign of the cross, 

Our Father 

who is in heaven, holy is his name, your kingdom is coming, your will is being done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us our bread day by day, and forgive our sins as we forgive those who trespass and sin against us, and help us not to fall into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen 

Hail Mary, 

full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus.** Holy Mary, Mother of Jesus, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen 

Glory be to the Father, 

to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning, as it is now and as it will be forever to come. Amen"

Ricky 77333	"Romans 10
8 But what does it say? ""The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.""//"

Terence Sweeney	I cry nearly every time I hear this song, you can tell he pours his soul into it.
Nah, I’m Good	"“Everyone I know goes away in the end.” 
I got scared. Just imagine that you are 90 and all your friends and family are gone that you grew up with. You’re with your kids and grand kids, you’re happy. But alone..."
El George Rivera Rubio	This is how he said goodbye. June was gone, everyone was gone and he knew he was parting soon too. But he wanted to talk to his fans one last time. He just didn't knew that we would stay with us forever with this song.
sad child	I lost my feelings years ago and my only person I could talk to passed from cancer and all I do is remember her and it hurts knowing I have no one anymore I just wanna die I wanna be with her again she was my everything and now what ...
Your Dad Is A Bitch	Can someone explain real well how this is him in the video if he passed in 2003 ?? Even if it’s a cover How ?? Someone explain and sorry if it’s a dumb question
B Graff	A true legend, singing for the last time🙏🏼
Adrian Adrian	Cash is overrated 🙄 the original is 1000% better NIN
Justin M	"Soy muy joven, para pasar por responsabilidades tan grandes.. que en veces pienso en darme por vencido, me da tristeza no aprovechar mi juventud al máximo... La vida pasa rápido, y... yo ya no se que hacer...
Me eh quedado sin amigos... y mi único compañero es mi Gato.
No se por cuanto más aguantare esto.."
SeDevri	"Honestly have NO idea how anyone could ""Dislike"" this video/song.  Doesn't matter how many times I listen to it, I get choked up."

Cheif_LittleBear	That hurt to watch...
Brad Beck	Johnny Cash made this song into a Redemption Song of our Lives..  This song reminds me of the movie Shawshank Redemption when Red says the following words: There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try to talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that.

K Reade	Words are not enough...
KDad514	A triumph of pain, anguish and reckoning of past misdeeds. Sometimes you just have to put The Man in Black on repeat to see if you still feel.
Prem Singh Bhuller	When making the video, no-one realised that it was in-fact Johnny Cash's wife who was about to pass away...   A tribute to a beautiful woman.
Payton Harper	I can just feel the pain he's feeling as he sings, you can't ignore it, it overwhelms you to a point that is uncontrollable. And as you try to control it all of the memories of your life good and bad just wash over you. You remember the people that love you, the people that you love, and the people that died. You think about all of your problems right now and all of the problems you've had before.
Sky Robinson	"Whether it be this version, or the original, this song is just one of those songs that makes you emotional in the most beautiful of ways.

However, that being said...

Johnny Cash did it his way, and made it his own in such a way, that Trent Reznor himself said, 'That isn't my song anymore, it's his.'

Long live the legendary Man in Black."
Bret	That hurt to watch never have before..

froggie1	Whew.....man. This song got me in the heart when Trent sang it. But Johnny's version, PLUS this video? I cry so hard I almost sob 😭
robot01001	So, I've listened to the original NIN song about a thousand times before hearing this version, so maybe I'm biased. I don't get the love for this cover. Trent Reznor is far more expressive and passionate than this rendition.
Vivi	I LOVE this song. What I took from it, becoming famous, and wealthy brought him nothing. Everyone still left. Either through death, or other circumstances. Hence the huge table full of food and golden chair. Yet he laments it. And maybe he did some things he regrets. I don't know if he did anything horrible. When Johnny was an old man I was a teenager. But he shaped how I view music.
carl rose	Wow, what a powerful ballad.
BananaDope	"A real good song is a song you can close your eyes to, and just listen...
This is one of em'"

henry farmer	My parents just yelled at me because of my grades. This song can mean alot of things. Like dang.
Amy Lively	Couldn't see, couldn't breathe, and was in constant pain. He had to lay down after singing one line. But he got up and sang another line and did it all over again. That is the essence of Johnny Cash.
GAMBIT	"Even this song was never written by J.C. the emotion behind his singing. Made it that much better. 

For none true J.C. fans. He didn't hit his fame till way to late in his life, when he finally got to sing his own songs. By that time his days where coming to a end. So this song was basically a big F U. I dont want this or need this. I just want my wife back. The only thing that ever truly matter to me."
Daniel Machado	Jesus, talk about crying with a full belly ham...
Dark Fire	Rest In Peace Johnny cash 😥
Pepe Taze	Love it the song
Full Freezer Outdoors	Wow 🥺
THE ONLINE CHRISTIAN MINISTER	All I know is that the time is now for people to have an close relationship with God while they are still living and with that being said if anyone want to change their life right now for the better all they have to do is allow God to come into their life and make God leader of their life. For if they do they will become a winner in life, experience true happiness, experience long lasting success all they have to do is make the best choice of their life right now and start a close relationship with God by them praying to God everyday for his help in every decision of their life everyday and in every situation of their life everyday for I guarantee if they do this everyday then their life will get better, they will have more peace, they will be more successful, they will have more happiness, and all their dreams will come true that’s because when they pray to God then God will make all good things possible for them and they must not forget to read the “Holy Bible” everyday and a great place for them to start in the holy Bible is (Psalms 1) and everyday after that read a chapter in Psalms till they finish all the chapters in Psalms then after that start on (Proverbs 1) then everyday after that read a chapter in Proverbs till they finish all the chapters in Proverbs and after that read every chapter of the Holy Bible until they finish it for it will change their life in the most amazing way

I_HAVE_AUTHORITAH	"Back in 2014, my mother was sick and got to the hospital, i went to see her every day, one day i was at home alone, and a friend passed by, i told him the situation and he told me his father went through this too so he told me; you know Julien, your mom loves you and wish so much you were there with her, so he lifted me to the hospital ans dropped me off, and tell me to not let down the ones we loved, later that night i gave her, without knowing it, my final kiss, my last hug and my eternal good bye.

Couple months after i was driving on the high way and this song came on, after 1 minute, i had to stop on the side of the road because i was crying so bad, it remembered me how i was so selfish about myself for not going to see her that night, forever will be greatful in that friend.
Without him i would have regret it so much it woulda hurt forever."

Both of us were on silence, then tears came from our eyes as i miss my mom and my dad miss his wife.
Error File	Petition to keep youtube from putting ads on emotional songs like these

JustElvin	Perfect.
RoisinElektra	The expression Galoogs means what? Never heard before...thx
SVUTI YT	I come here when I regret my mistakes in the past, and those I keep making, and I see it increasingly impossible to make some of my dreams come true. Also sometimes I think that I will not be anyone in the future, I am just someone else who lives life. I don't usually cry easily, but when I think about things like this, I feel tears coming to my eyes.

A perfect song with a perfect cover.  Normally not a big fan of Trent Reznor, but THIS is the best song he ever wrote and Johnny Cash totally steals the thunder by one upping him on it's delivery.

Reznors original version IS good...  Cash's cover though, is AMAZING.

The Man in Black had a way about him..."

Stinky Juicebox	"Lyrics:

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"
Dennis H	"An Addict singing a song about addiction that written by a fellow Addict.

lil ms mischief	I remember that feeling.  It sits deep in your gut and knaws at you from the inside out. There was a time in my life when I made bad choices. They changed who I was. I felt I'd lost myself completely.  Didn't realize I'd become a monster.  Then I was able to finally see my mistakes,  to right my wrongs. It's not to late to seek forgiveness.  It's never too late to change what you don't like about yourself.

Samuel. Z García	"Lyrics:

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

Mr. Blonde	My sister died when she was 31. Her death was never solved. She was a heroin addict. I can't stop to listen to his and the original NIN version. The pain that both artists were able to share in their own way touches me every time.

Alicia García	"Letra en español de la canción de Johnny Cash, Hurt (letra traducida)
Hoy me hago daño,
para ver si sigo sintiendo.
Me concentro en el dolor,
la única cosa que es real.
La aguja hace un agujero,
el viejo pinchazo de siempre.
Intento acabar con ello del todo,
pero me acuerdo de todo.

¿En qué me he convertido,
mi más dulce amigo?
Todas las personas que conozco,
al final se van.
Y podrías tenerlo todo,
mi imperio de basura.
Te decepcionaré,
te haré sufrir.

Llevo esta corona de espinas,
sobre mi trono de mentiroso.
Lleno de pensamientos rotos
que no puedo arreglar.
Bajo las manchas del tiempo,
los sentimientos desaparecen.
Tú eres otra persona,
yo todavía sigo estando aquí.

¿En qué me he convertido,
mi más dulce amigo?
Todas las personas que conozco,
al final se van.
Y podrías tenerlo todo,
mi imperio de basura.
Te decepcionaré,
te haré sufrir.

Si pudiera empezar de nuevo,
a millones de millas de aquí.
Me mantendría alejado del resto,
encontraría una manera."
Michael O	Whatever producer or audio engineer added the very slight over drive leading to just a hair of distortion in Cash's voice and the piano at the end of the song is a genius.  Something about it makes it 10x more powerful like Cash is trying to reach through the speakers and make you listen to his words and take in the meaning for yourself.  Brilliant end to the song.
Poundman Poundman	Ich bekomme jedes mal eine Gänsehaut bei diesem Song. Johnny Cash is eine Legende!

I don’t know you and you don’t  know me . Probably we are not even living in the same country . We look different . You may be older than me or younger . We are just completely strangers . But there are a few things which connect us . We are humans . We have emotions and feelings . A personality which defines us . And we are both on YouTube , searching for sad songs, no matter why. Please, if you read this. No matter what's going on in your life at the moment ,you can do it ! You can manage out if it, you will stay strong because there are people who love you ! And these people are worth it. Yes, we are strangers but not too far away from eachother to not say that you are a great person !!! Because you are ! I hope even if it’s just one of you, that I could help or support you in a way . This comment is for all the lonely people out there 🤍 Heaps of love xxx"

Shane Dsilva	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

El hijo de la Conserje	"I cannot deny NIN version is great. However, it is JC´s version the one that let´s me totally devastated from within. Same lyrics, but his voice, the music itself, it is the exact way I´ve been feeling since ever. 
Today it is way more damaging for personal reasons, but it is additionally a relief to put my own emotions in words, and even more in such a beautiful way as this song is. Thanks a lot to all evolved in the production of this song."
Cåmerön Salander	This song was created by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. This old fool made wife beating country.
Brandtwulf	Anybody else started crying:'(
Chrisdonian	I’m only sharing this because I care, you don't know when you're going to die it could be today, and on that day you will stand before a righteous God, who will judge you accordingly, for even lying is an abomination to the lord, making us all guilty(10 commandments) so I ask you to think very deeply about what I'm saying and repent and trust in the saviour who is God in flesh, who died for your sin, for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord, he can pay your fine in the just court case and in that create in you a new heart to follow God, loving what he does and hating what he hates, saved by his grace not by your efforts

Town of Jezza	"he died soon after
how truly tragic"
Joe Citizen	Why must we age? Why can't we stop the aging process? One day we will have the science to do so. As soon as we learn how to control the genes. I believe this to be true, as it has been spoken of in science. It is a matter of resequencing, or flipping certain genes! The time will come that when we will be able to stop the aging process. How we apply it will be another thing.
Luis Pereira	"This piece of art is timeless... I remember being 12 years old and looking to my future, but when it finally came, I just wanted to go back. When you grow up and realize that in a way or another, science cannot explain why do we live. Is it just to live 70 years and then our mind goes dark for eternity? Why the fuck are we here?!?!?!? 
Even so, I am looking for answers in religion, just to have a small chance of re-encountering the ones I lost in the future. Damn, that's so sad :("

Thomas Brown	I think about how much time I've wasted, the phone calls I didn't make, the trips I didn't take.  There is so much truth in this song.  My grandfather lived to be 100 and his sadness would show from time to time as he had outlived his spouse, siblings, and friends.  This song is so so true.

Prophet	It hits hard today
Hadrian Dwyer	Nearly every comment about how deeply this song affects someone seems to be how looking back on it they realize the true pain and message being conveyed. While I probably am not yet old enough to fully understand the song, the look of pain and emptiness in Cash's eyes tears me to shreds because it reminds me of the look that my great grandfather had in his eyes on his deathbed. He was such a giant of a man and had no right dying as soon as he did, I still years later can't fully deal with how much I miss him and how I should feel about it. The last memory I had of him alive was at the Louisville hospital where he was being taken care of. He was lying asleep in his bed and I thought he looked so damn peaceful despite how sick I knew he was. He had been getting better and seemed like he had a shot of making it, he had been having spells of conciousness where he could keep his eyes open, focus on people and just barely speak, his oxygen levles were doing better and he didn't need assistance breathing bar rare occasions. From what I had seen and heard, he was doing great. The day he died my mom, my grandpa, my great-aunt and I went to lunch at the Red Robin's nearby the hospital and ordered some food. After we finished our meal we sat around and chatted until my mom got a text from my great grandmother; they had decided to pull the plug. It was just his time to go. The only thing that I could feel was emptiness. When we got to the room, it was too late, we didn't even get to say goodbye. His skin was so white and cold, it all seemed fake. There was no way that this man who was such a massive part of me could be gone. He had to still be alive. I wanted so desperately to do anything to get him to come back, but there was nothing I could do. The only man that I had ever truly and fully looked up to was gone and there was nothing I could do about it. I couldn't even cry. He was a priest for a time and was always a man of god, but I wish with all my heart he would've held out on leaving this world for just a little longer. If there ever was a man who walked in god's footsteps, it was Glace Wallace. Whether you knew him as Glace the Priest, Glace the Marine, Glace the Government worker or Glace the Family man, you could always count on him and look up to him. I'm endlessly proud to be even remotely related to  him and I hope and pray that someday I can grow to be in any way similar to the man who came closest to perfection.
Gabriel Benselum	All legendary artists should get a song and video like this one.
BNA Rock	Who's here from Codfish - Boots n' Cats!  ?
Bain	"People often say that the new pop stars and whatnot are discriminated against because they play towards teenage girls. Genres and groups like k-pop, One Direction, Justin Bieber.
No.
Until K-pop can pull off this kind of beautiful soul, the rest that comes from knowing you are about to die, that you have reached the end of your long white line, they cannot compare to the Man in Black.
Until One Direction can hold their band together long enough to touch the world and keep people listening, discovering, wondering fifty-plus years since their heyday, those boys can't be on the same level as the Boy Named Sue.
Until Justin Bieber can cultivate an outlaw persona, but still obey things like traffic laws and avoid charges like reckless endangerment, he shall not come close to the Folsom Prisoner.
This is why music has not been the same since the days of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley. Because they have no emotion, no soulful sound of a lone guitar, no characteristic to call their own, because they all follow the same trend they all create.
This is why Johnny Cash is superior."

Nickolaus Afon	Yeah, I know he passed. But he was around a long damn time. It's not easy living so long and doing so much. There will always be rest for us in the end.
Nickolaus Afon	A lot of musicians, especial rock stars, die too soon. They burn out or overdose. Some kill themselves and others are ruined by bad times or a loss of fame. You know someone is a Legend when they've lasted the ages, decades of fame, decades of hardship. Great man. Full of meaning, lyrics, reality. I wish young musicians aspired more to This level. Because we can't all be legends and talking about it isn't doing it. I hope we see new Legends this time, this century, for real.

Edgar	Logan.....what did you do....?
Shelia Alderson	When this video first came out, I had been channel surfing. When I saw this playing, I couldn’t turn away from it. I watched it through til it ended.  It hits you in the heart- the song itself & the man singing it! RIL, Johnny Cash!!!
D C	"This song takes my breath away, brings tears to my eyes, and makes me realize how precious life truly is. I've lost so many of my friends, so many people that I love, ""every one I know, goes away, in the end"" could not hit closer to home. I've been to the House of Cash, its now a building housing a law firm. Johnny Cash is burried across the street along side his wife June. Johnny Cashs' house is no longer standing. Burned to the ground during restoration, (thanks Barry Gibb.) I can't find the words to convey my thoughts or how I feel, but this song is one of the most powerful and emotional songs of MY LIFETIME. Thank you Mr. Reznor and Mr. Cash. God be with you both."

Isaiah Bastille	I can't honestly express this man's influence on my life. Growing up with Cash's music helped my love of life and when the museum shut down, I bawled. When his wife passed away, I was so scared he was next,then it happened. I've only recently started listening to him again, before this it was too much pain to listen to his voice. Now, after years, it feels like a new chapter.

Lucas Santos Costa	"Lyrics:

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

MMOChampTTV	This song reminds me of all that I have lost in the pass that is so valuable to me now. This song reminds me of memories of good and bad. And finally this song reminds me of thing's I ponder I could've have done to change the past. Life is a fragile thing and no one knows how fragile it is until they have experienced such a loss.
Cain Horton	"Johnny singing ""Everyone I know, goes away, in the end."" will forever haunt me. My dad played this all the time when I was a kid. 22 now, and it still haunts me in my darkest moments. It's the truest thing I've ever heard, and I'll most likely die with the line still haunting me.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the support, depression is a horrible...cancer of the soul, but knowing others fight it and are supporting one another has such a macabre beauty. Thank you all, and please stay strong! We're better than the voices in our heads and the desires of the darkest parts of our hearts."

zancospancos	Wow! Artist!
Jonathan X	Perfect.
Toofwess	Anybody that says NiN did it better is a fool. This has raw, unfiltered emotion running through it all the way to the core. NiN's version has the energy of an angsty teen crying about a middle school relationship failing. Cash's version has the energy of a man with so many regrets he wishes he could take back. So many loved ones gone. The way it sounds like he's going to burst into tears at any moment hits you deep. Anybody that doesn't tear up at this masterpiece is a sociopath.
Douglas Martin *SaveAmerica2022*	Time is the greatest enemy to us all.. I’d do anything to go back to the past and actually cherish it this time..

Michael Lambrecht	This song is so underrated. It showed a true lifelong talent and to be able to belt out a such powerful song in his twilight years is a true testament to his god given  talent.
Commander JOJ	This song plays a role in the reason why my firstborn son is named Cash.
Michael McClain	Man, i grew up to old man blasting Johnny..1 piece at a time... and all his hits.  I remember not liking my old mans taste in music but now im 30 years old, he truely  knew what music was compared to this old shit

Jamesy	Truly remarkable
Austin Weeks	Also fucking move out of America if its that bad here leave pls youll see how other countries treat their citizens like shit also god bless America
Central YouTube Investigation	This would be a really rdr2 ending song
Gerard Reilly III	Not only is the original an amazing song but this cover makes it even greater. If you cant think about all the things in your life that made you who you are or who you aren't, you're not listening. We've all had ups and downs. Good times and bad. What have you learned from them? Did you let it destroy you or did you embrace the pain and make yourself even better.
SkeligMichael	New nice features, you added here. But when you lock me out again tomorrow, they are good for nothing. You let it spin longer and longer. You are a powerfull disappointment to me. Once I liked to visit YouTube, but this times are over. It´s boring here and have no longer the patience to see, how my comments are deleted. And how you lock me out. YouTube was good until 2009. Then it started slowly to crash. I have nothing more to say.
Ray	"Full Lyrics
Hurt Songtext

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Brooklyn3955	Only song that ever brought me to tears, and let's not forget the emotional value of the video itself with images that will touch us all because of the images of Johnny as both young and in his prime as well as old.  The visual art and the musical art combine to really punch us in the gut - and oh, it does.
Dubmajick	Just wow so beautiful,  i heard the song a long time ago, but i wasn't aware there was a video,  and it brought tears because,  I remember riding in my fathers van before he passed, and this song came on the radio,  and my father said wow that was a beautiful song,  my father being a CASH fan,  knew right away it was cash,  But i had explained yes it is beautiful dad,  and who really wrote the song, me being a massive NIN fan,  then i had my father listen to the NIN version, and  well i cannot put the rest into words because that moment was for him and I only;  but me and my father shared a beautiful moment. Watching this now 6 years after his passing has reduced me into tears,  He would be so proud of me now,  clean and sober for 5 and a half years I'd give anything to have him here, to see me without a bottle in my hand. Spend time and love your parents, don't hold grudges,  enjoy every minute because tragedies happen so fast and so unexpected,  my thoughts are so hard to type right now so filled with emotion,   Love one another please; there is so much hate today on social media, Love seems to be really just missing from society at the moment,  it is so easy to Hate, and be Ignorant but thats so shallow and hollow. Love has to be given and also earned,  but then love is so cherished and so rare,  its so special and so meaningful but it sure doesn't come easy does it.
HesseJamez	R.I.P. and thank you for the music, great old man.

cryptidseafog	last night i almost overdosed and god it was scary. i barely managed to get out of bed and go to my mother to tell her what happened. before i did i wrote out a note as in those fleeting moments i felt absolutely awful and alone. i didnt want my disabled mother to deal with that pain. i didnt want my father to deal with it either. i couldn't just leave the whole farmyard, and leave those animals in limbo. how could i leave my partner like that? they'd feel horrible! i couldn't do that to them. or to my best friend, who is counted as my sister. it was really eye opening for me, and what made it worse for me at least. was i could swear my sweet sweet dog (who had to be pit down on September 21st) was right there with me and it felt so so real. it felt like she was there, like she was trying to wake me up. i could have sworn that my grandmother jamie and my grandfather cliff although they were on different sides of the family was there to. i swore i heard yelling and it was like i was being shaken awake. it was absolutely terrifying. it really was an eye opening experience. i always thought my mom and dad didn't really care for me. but the fact that they were so so scared.. it really shook me. I don't know why this song that I've only ever heard of from a polyphonic video kept playing in my mind. is there a point to this comment? i dont know. if you find one let me know.

Lisa M	“You skins isn’t paper, don’t cut it. Your life isn’t a book so don’t end it” but you know that. Don’t you? “Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” You know. It’s been drilled into you head since the day you learned what suicide was. Yet no one ever gives you a reason to stand behind. Don’t end it until you get to try frog. Don’t end it until you make an internet best friend. Don’t end it ‘till you meet your internet best friend. Don’t end it until you find out what happened to that stray dog you saw in third grade. Don’t end it until you fully use a pencil. Don’t end it because you could still smile a few more times. Don’t end it because though you are small in the grand scheme of things, your existence is a miracle. Carefully crafted by the universe . Don’t end it because people will miss you. Don’t end it because I will miss you.

_Lycostehwulf_	December 1st of 2017 this world lost you. To Noelia, I'm sorry. One of my best friends, this girl I grew up with named Noelia. Nelli we all called her. She died before her 16th birthday while her boyfriend was driving drunk. Now she's dead and he's in prison, never to feel whole again. What I would do to hear her say some dumb shit again. I wish I could erase the memory of her viewing. I wish that the version of her I see in my head was her smiling and joking , but now, most of the time the version of her I see is in a casket with her face recently reconstructed. I remember her mom crying and holding on to the casket before passing out, and having to be carried away by all of her brothers. She was her mother's only daughter in a household of I think 5 boys? If anyone gets drunk and sees this, please don't drink and drive. People love you. I promise someone loves you.
Jess Nichole	GOD BLESS!
David	In this song you hear life's full circle, over a rough road. Your name WILL live on a long time after your passing. RIP Big fella.

And our our coffins are the same in size,
Reguardless if they are of gold or pine."

Jim	The best song Johnny Cash performed in my opinion.
Adam Anderson	Says a lot of the human experience. Most people think the state of nirvana is some blissful high or good times. What’s sad is it’s the state that you reach when you don’t have to be reborn and live life again. Misery cannot be compared. Some is justified and some is not. But misery is misery and I feel his to my core and know that the suffering I faced is nothing of some others or what will come my way as I age.

Horst Humbug	"Full Lyrics
Hurt Songtext

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Raymond Neal	"One of the greatest songs ever, of the impermanence of it all. Johnny Cash was a legend! He accomplished and acquired more in his life than most ever could in many lifetimes. This song just speaks volumes of how temporary it all is. 

Value and cherish your days. Your time and the impact you leave on others is more important than any possession."

Mike Karam	This song...  sums my life... how the life I have been through.. changed me... hurt me... caused me to hurt those i love with my anger... and my words...  how I pushed my  now ex wife and high school sweetheart of almost 22 years away..  how when I was deployed and saw and went through the things I did...  here I sit a broken man. Clouded in my own thoughts.  Afraid to forget or forgive my self for what I have done.   I'm now doing the same with my New GF.  I would give almost anything to start over... and not screw it all up.   Its times like this I wish I had my parents still.

Lasgoo00	"It semms that everyone in this comment section has some wisdome he wants to share. Here is mine. This whole song is Amazing, it's shows us that Money and Fame is not everything. At the very end everything dies. Thats how it is and you can't deny it. The Decisions we make define us and what we did with the time that was given to us.
Make the best out of your life and try to treat everyone how you would like to be treated."
Michael Monroe	"His cover of this Nine Inch Nail's hit from the 90's has a lot more meaning behind it. Though considered to be his epitaph, it was almost never happened. He listened to the song and didn't feel that he would be able to do a cover of it, believing that NIN's sound was too far off of his. After reading the lyrics, he worked with producer Rick Ruben (it was Ruben who convinced him to do the cover). This song became a track on Johnny's last album to be released before his death. This video was filmed in February of 2003. It was 3 months later that his wife, June Carter Cash, passed away. Johnny's passing came that following September.

This song takes on a different meaning for me. It is not just because we seen 2 Country music legends before their passing away. Johnny was one of my grandfather's favorite singers. He passed away in 1999, 3 years before the release of the song. Every time I hear it, I remember seeing how my grandfather was hours before his passing. If he was alive when the song came out, there is one part of the lyrics that I feel that he would have said to me... 

Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

He is always here with me."

305kubrick	Mr. Cash had been a believer for many years up until his death.  He would invite people backstage to share the gospel with anyone who would listen.  This video tells the story of what life is like without God. It is all meaningless.  But it also offers hope. In our sinfulness and depravity,  the Lord presents us with a lavish table and a divine invitation,  to taste heaven here on earth.  May you rest in realms of blazing light Mr. Cash.
Mateo	Temazo
Kristin L Ford	Me too...we are still wishing that we are the ones that HOPED we had done something...more ??? Hopeful.

David Justus	I love Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor teams with David Bowie for the best song on David Bowie's greatest hits album I'm afraid of Americans but this version of hurt is by far the best it's like Bob Dylan wrote many great records but most of his own versions with a few exceptions were. The best version of the songs the birds made many great records out of his songs and so did many others and this is just one of those cases where someone else made a better version of the song by a great artist on the other hand I can't stand Johnny Cash's version of one YouTube version is much better Johnny Cash was a great singer and a great man and a great American

Matteo Ambrosi	"“Everyone I know goes away in the end”

When I was younger I believed that this line referred to the dead and to the trauma of aging, seeing everyone you cared about dying. Lately though I’m thinking that this could be even worse: everyone I know chooses not to come with me, but to leave, abandoning me forever and not coming back."
Darryl Holmes	This song is every persons life

Matthew Easley	Tough life but you have to keep trucking and your head up
Saralyn Fosnight	"I heard this song first in the episode of ""Person of Interest"" where the Taraji P. Hansen character is killed. It is emotionally intense and deeply wounding. Seldom have I heard a song that tore me apart the way this one did first time I heard it and even now. But I've always thought it was about drugs. The image of a Christ figure only confuses the narrative, I believe."

somekindofbrain	love makes you great and love kills you
H.	Can we all take a minute to give credit to the writer of Hurt. Who poured his soul into this song. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. This is a beautiful song that countless people relate to and we thank you for putting our feelings into words. Johnny Cash wanting to cover it only speaks to your brilliance. You're right Trent, you can't say no to a legend. You lost something personal but don't forget, many of us know it's yours. Regardless of who sings it, Hurt is your song
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	I absolutely love Nine Inch Nails, even more than I love Johnny Cash, but this is undeniably better.

Kirk Hancock	"I listened to this several times and was moved.  Wonderful videography, editing to go with that voice.  Powerful images to match the song.  And when it was over a bl00dy ad for some modern, ""famous rapper"".  The contrast couldn't be more stark.  Hurt - that is music in all its glory."
francesca katz	Words escape me. I salute  you Mr.Cash  then,now&always
Logan	Nine Inch Nails better have gotten fat royalties for this song.

Pohaku	I just lost my Grandpa and now listening to Johnny Cash reminds me of him
Carbine	"I'm writing an album and decided to take inspiration from the conflict of the two songs

cash:
old man reflecting, trying to find peace in his choices, maybe he wishes he was better to his kids, or took better care of his ears. 
in cash's case i see a man who wishes he failed as a musical artist. especially with the whole empire of dirt line.


then there's the nine inch nails one: 
this version didn't make me cry though, it make me angry and worried whats happening to me. and the anxiety of jumping off the diving board, or in that songs case, shooting myself has a longing feeling of ending, but we are met with noise. 


both versions are met with no resolution, cash died and the character in the NIN version died. the point is not the journey, its the end. and without the end there is no need for a journey.

i saw a comment that said that ended with a G with another song along the lines of ""sol sun"" or something. and they mentioned that the sun will rise again. 
but the bitter ignorance of both songs is that we don't get to see the sun rise. we only see the end. thats the beauty in my opinion, the fact that there's no apparent realization that life goes on, the song ends with G, but the bittersweet feeling of ""the sun will rise again"" doesn't come until your down counting down your seconds to live.  

like i said earlier, cash is looking back and trent wants the past gone.
both are awaiting the end.
cash fears that day.
trent longs that day."

jwar	As my generation fades into the twilight of time and We step away from the realm of life as death over takes Us, the music of Our era will carry on to the youth and new generations of the world. For We pushed boundaries and overcame a many hurtle to break the molds and models of the prior generation. Yet as their music still carries into the never ending future Ours is right there beside theirs leaving its profound mark upon history forever more . Enjoy those that are youthful of spirit, but aged with time, enjoy those that their ears are finding this music for the first time. We told Our story in some of this music and it spoke to the world of whom We were. To all the artist male and female that shared with my generation their talent and their time.  I thank you. May your music surpass Us all into endless depths of time, may your music outlive time itself.
Ricky Ramming	Good stuff. Johnny Cash gave up a lot of crazy shit that he lived through and wrote about. But his reflections were so gritty and real, unlike say maybe James Taylor - who I dearly love as a songwriter btw. Here is what made JC immortal, literally - he accepted Christ as his savior, plain and simple. This insane life as a touring country music star was a run with the Devil and he dug in and beat it with the power of the Holy Spirit - not easy when you are rich, popular and talented.
Jaroslav Maniš	Hajzl jeden zasraný....  Bůh byl. Ale dovolil si umřít.
josh bryant	If he could start again, he would answer the call of God on his life. That's what this song was about. Giving away his empire of dirt and instead following the call of the dove. He is remorseful of living a life of fame and fortune instead of suffering for Christ.
David Dzien	This song is the greatest cover of all time. It is also, by a wide margin, the most pwoerful. Rest in peace, Man in Black.
Krustenfresser	Das beste Lied was ich jeh gehört habe. Muss jedes mal heulen wenn ich es höre, ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Daniel Devereaux	A milestone.
Adam Maik	Sweet Jesus. I wish his recorder studio re-mastered the track. Horrible clipping starting at 3:13 making the song impossible to listen to on sensitive hi-res gear :/ Aside from that, deep reflection... good song.
Andrew Mayhew	The song is so sad, but added with the video it’s devastating.
Yoo Yoo	Thanks Mr cash    Balll in paradise 🙏

Zable Blam	The scenes of his past fame and the now abandoned tributes are what really get me. Knowing that your glory days are long gone and there’s nothing you can do about it. Knowing that you didn’t appreciate them as much as you should have.

Endz Ela	"I was reading ""the bastard of Istanbul"" by elif shafak two years ago, the main character's favorite singer was Johnny Cash.

Teresa Dial	I guess he big fan of that Logan movie
Colin Gage	Some cover versions seem pointless,this doesn't!
Adam Seidel	In addition to the many valid comments about the emotion and meaning behind the song, let's also not forget this is a sung performance by a man who is 70 years old, and a fairly hard running 70's years at that, and he's still able to bring the full power of his distinctive bass voice to bear on this song. Not very many singers at all can still bring the force like that at that age.

Victor Gabriel	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

curtis cote	Not one person in the 50 comments below listened to the words of the song, this is exactly why anyone today can blurt out garbage and be a superstar, this is a beutiful song but not one of u understood the song was about doing heroin, being a mess and liar, selling his soul and everyone around him goes away whether they die or cant tolerate him,  and that hed trade it all to start again and keep his soul! That all his accomplishments mean nothing, nine inch nails did this song first before johnny cash

I watched the YouTube video of it, and didn't care for it at all.

Take a break, because you are heartbroken. You must move slowly across the bridge. Life is long and sunshine is just around the corner. You can trust her, sun is always there for you. Listen to your guts, you are more right than you think. There are laws that made this world and those laws serve you! You are important and its ok to want to die, it just shows that you want to live and to be more alive. Peace!

3 years without you makes my life harder everyday but I hope one day I'll be able to hold you in my arms once again. If heaven is real then you're there."

Rice-a-FashionBoss	Essa música me lembra de algo que eu vivi, um lugar que já estive mas não consigo me lembrar muito bem, uma forte cultura western relacionada à essa música, algo relacionado à uma época que eu gostaria de viver e em tal lugar já senti, porém, como já dito, infelizmente não me lembro muito bem. É uma sensação muito estranha.

Kemal Elektrikci	Very good song. I love this song and Johnny Cash
Budahbaba	Hurt is universal.  As much as i may dislike certain people, the knowledge that they hurt just the same way that i do keeps me in check.  And it prompts me to try to extend a hand to them, to get out of that pain.  But even when we are standing erect, our feet are planted firmly on that pain that we have to walk on.  We have no choice but to live with it, and deal with it.  Nature.
JulianDucky	We lost a legend, but gained a lifetime of great songs

Sophdog	So heart-wrenching; always moves me to tears.

Autumn Alea	"When I start to feel the urge to self-harm, I pull up this song and listen to it on repeat until the urge is gone. Hearing the phrase ""I hurt myself today to see if I still feel, I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real"" is the most accurate thing I have ever heard from a past of being an avid self-harmer, I did it to feel something and to focus on something other than what was going wrong in my life."

Legomaster888	Who's coming here after watching Bee Movie knock-offs from Quinton reviews
Salman Kayani	He made it effective via his use of rhetorical devices AND allusions to the passage of time. The song is like an essay because it contains a message that can be conveyed, and it has a thesis we can all sympathize with, through logos.

museken	Do you know what the songs about?... John wrote and played music before he could read. ..He played it and preformed it before he could read . People ridiculed him and made fun of him because of that. You can't read John they said.. Then John  learned to read and to understand that people hurt him  his so called friends.. because of the past. So all the people he knew ran away or tried to make fun of him because they taught they are superior..Johns music killed them all.. John made money. John got respect among the greatest music people in the world.. Hurt... is the story of his life . and it's one of my favorite songs. I did not go away. I'm defending Honor... Don't buy a t..shirt listen to Johns music.. .... Up The Irons...
DJAY-_- DJAY	Why can i hear joel from the last of us sing this?
dabo71	The empire in this case is everything BUT dirt...Cash is one of the few that everyone can understand and respect. Regardless of genre preference. Genuine to a point that is lost almost nowadays. Wholesome and a renegade at the same time, but the knowledge of right and wrong and respect.

kikoltu	THANKS YOU
Stephen Jones	This song really hits home, I just watched my dad take his last breath today. Hardest thing I've ever had to go through.
Veloxic	I had always enjoyed this song before, but.. a week before my birthday in March, my dad suddenly died from a heart attack. I turned 17 a week later. I never felt emotional pain or tragedy like this. I was expecting grandparents, or uncles, or aunts, but it was my dad. One of the closest people in my life. I feel broken.

There is so much wisdom in age."

Maximum Axiom	When you realize that we live in a lie. We do not need driving licence to drive, insurance, road tax. HMRC is a private corporation and you have being paying taxes voluntary coz you are stupid. Mortgage, council tax, money system, government, mailing fraud, electricity/ waters bills............everything is fraud. When you register you children, they become ward of the state.....because you filled in form in Birth certificate that you are informant (check your child's certificate).......WTF???? on your vehicles V5c form it says that you are not the owner of your car. Guess who is????

Adesh Kumar	"Money is the root of all evil . 
I've seen people become rich and become selfish nasty people .

My nan told me live the simple life 
 
What Johnny cash is trying to sing and say is that he knew he wasn't a nice person with all that fame and monies .. 
Thats why he said your can have my empire of dirt meaning materialism that made him not proud of himself of hurting people ... 

Love when he said he wish he could go back in time with what he concluded of his lifestyle and said he'll start again and find a way ... 

Sad comment what have I become ??? Everyone I know goes away meaning he treated them bad and HURT them."
Adesh Kumar	"now I KNOW WHY THIS SONG Ws my fav Johnny cash song .
MY DAD was very rich had it all but treated his loved ones like my mum esp very badly .
But he became a Christian and had alot of guilt and shame of what he did ...
But God forgives . 
Your a legend Johnny cash and youll never ever be forgotten. 
Sadly for most monies fame is the root of all evil."

Central YouTube Investigation	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

THE THREE Colour Music Neko	I am not a man who belive in the Bibel or other Books that said what i should think or Belive.. but i felt that piece of Music and i must say ... Where ever you are Mister Cash i hope you see the Universe with that eyes like you did befor
Dusty	"I always avoided watching this video, for the longest time. I mean, it's a little strange - he's my grandfather, and I think subconsciously, I never really wanted to be associated with him, desperate to be my own person from a young age. The brain of the family. The scientist. The artist, animator, pilot. Anything but the rockstar Johnny was. Unfortunately, being my own person has, over the years, landed me in depression, pain, and a lot of mistakes that I would do anything to take back. 
.
I've always been a bit of a shadow. I think that I tried to be, and by the time I realized that I wanted to be known, silence was the only thing I knew. 
.
I could never be as good as him. I could never even hope to reach that level of iconic. That's not an issue that a lot of people should take seriously, and don't think I'm discounting myself from that advice. But I'm two generations away from it, and the possibility is right in my face, screaming, *he could do it, so why can't you?* And I could never play the ""he's my grandpa"" card because frankly, that just sounds conceited, and I wanted to be proud of myself for my own accomplishments, not my family name, or my born status. I feel so bad for my father who never even had a chance to be himself. His name is literally John Cash. You've got your life set up for you right there, if that's the name you're born with. 
.
Still, I'm just sitting here, in in-patient therapy, nineteen years old with zero popularity to have ever spoken of, wishing I had been someone better. Wishing that I could be. I'm feeling lonely, feeling like I can't do all that much with the musical/artistic talent that I do have, venting to the comments section on youtube because I could never be anywhere close to his success. I could never fill his shoes. 
.
What do I even want? My minute of fame? Some friends? Someone to feel pity for me? What do I *want*? And why am I so tired of what I have? I should be grateful, you know. Even with the hardships, I still have food and money, shelter if I need it. 
.
But, with my age has come more exposure to his emotional side, and I see things a little bit differently now. He spoke his heart to the world. He was honest, and painfully human, and... my grandpa died when I was two. He loved me very much, and I think he would be proud of me for making it this far. He would believe in me.
.
This video is so striking. The shake in his hands, pouring the wine, reminds me so much of my dad. The House of Cash Museum that I remember going into as a kid, after it was closed down, all storage boxes and guitar cases. It makes me realize that his life is not about me. It's about family. He's family. We all are. And, with the way he presents his heart to the world, everyone else is too. I can take my life into my own hands, but the family love is what binds us together, and I have no place to feel resentment for his own monumental success, because it was his love that brought him to the stage in the first place. 
.
He gave me a stage name, you know. One that I regret to admit I've never even thought of using. ""Maybelle Cash."" The combination of two separate icons, both prominent in my blood. My middle and last name. That's me... his little Maybelle. 
.
I love you too, grandpa."

MARSBELLA1	Its about being addicted to drugs my friend - but most people commenting never have been thus they dont really understand the song.

Soli Deogloria	People that ask who's still listening in 2020 are just ignorant and will be in 2021 too. Good music is timeless. That's about all. 😉

TheGismo94	"I like both versions, the original one and this one because both are about something different.
The original from nine inch nails is about the drug abuse and depression.
And this version is about a man at the end of his life."

Renato Gomes	Voz de arrepiar, canta demais. ❤❤
freedomslastflight	This probably going to buried under the sea of worthy comments. But this song premiered a year after my grandfather passed away. He was big fan of Johnny Cash had a lot of records and knew some of his songs on guitar. The same year 2002 I lost my grandmother the doctors said Cancer. Everyone at home knew it was a broken heart.
Mai Neh	"Modern day SOLOMON.....

Stéphane C	"I just discovered yesterday this amazing song. 
What a blast ... He touched my soul..."
Jared Hays	I wish I could've seen him live. That would've been a treat
a a	First time I heard this I laughed my ass off. Thought it was a Cash parody and it was funny as hell. When I found out it actually was Cash and it was serious I felt sorry for him. I don't get what people see in this version, it's horrible and a disgraceful way for Cash to finish his career.

Finn Shelton	The last time I listened to this song was before my father, at 52 died of a heart attack on October 2nd,2020. Listening to it a few days later, truly makes me cherish the wonderful time I was given with him.
Scott Wallace	As a good hippie during Johnny Cash's heyday, I pretended not to like him.  But I did, and I do.  What a great musician.
Zura Matchavariani	I drawned my tears for my parents.They are still alive.but I am kind of person everything comes to me untill it happends
ExoticcLegend	X-men flashbacks

Duckhawk Ninja	My best friend died one year ago today

dUt	I don't know why this reminds me of Logan m
Randall Franklin	Thanks Trent for writing this, and then being a big enough man to let somebody else paint on your canvas!!! I believe maybe the most touching recording ever!!!
Esther	This song is deeply spiritual, Maybe a song of repentance?  Johnny Cash walked away of his faith in Christ to follow a career which many said he “sold his soul for fame”... maybe this is a song confessing that it was not worth it. “Empire of dirt” & “If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself, I would find a way”... just maybe  it’s a message to the young not to fall in the same trap.  Johnny Cash is one of my favorite artists and I believe that God will never reject a person who sincerely repents. Nothing in this world catches God’s attention as much as broken heart.
Tee Kay	"Song: ""I wear this crown of thorns... "" 
Me: ""Wait, those aren't the words."""

QUIS UT DEUS	"Padre...
dimmi cosa hanno fatto al fiume..
che non canta piu'
che scivola via
come quei pesci
che sono morti
sotto un palmo di schiuma bianca
Padre,ora il fiume non e'piu'il fiume..
Prima che giunga l'estate
nascondi tutto cio'che trovi 
di vivo.
Cosa hanno fatto al bosco
Padre
che non c'e' piu'un albero
con quale legna accenderemo 
il fuoco..
sotto quale ombra troveremo riposo
se il bosco 
non ' e' piu' 
il bosco..
Prima che faccia buio
conserva un po'di vita nella tua dispensa..
perche'senza legna e 
senza pesci
dovremo bruciare la barca...
dovremo arare sopra le rovine
e dovremo chiudere 
la porta di casa con piu'
mandate.
Tu ci dici,Padre,che se c'e'vino 
ci sono
 i grappoli d'uva..
che se ci sono
i fiori
ci sono le api
e cera...
e...miele..
Pero'il campo 
non e'piu'quel campo..
c'e' qualcuno che va dipingendo
il cielo di rosso
e annunciando
pioggia di sangue..
C'e'qualcuno che fa la ronda...da quelle parti...Padre..
sono mostri di carne con vermi di ferro..
Affacciati..e digli che TU tieni a noi..
e digli che noi..
non abbiamo paura ...PADRE..Pero'
affacciati perche' sono loro che stanno
uccidendo la terra..
PADRE SMETTILA DI PIANGERE..
che CI HANNO
DICHIARATO
GUERRA...
          /
E'una canzone che con molta amarezza e con un po'
tanta vergogna voglio dire a quelle canaglie che bruciano i nostri boschi,   insozzano le nostre acque,
avvelenano 
i nostri alimenti,
appestano l'aria con i loro virus..e si arricchiscono con la miseria degli altri.

Alex G	This song makes me cry every time I listen to it
Khaled Ghazal	Hey i know a way but you have to trust me
Per Spellman	The American III and IV are some of the very best records ever made. As the arrangements and production could not have been made better, also the choise of songs is the greatest tribute to those who made them, and no one could make them more immortal than Johnny Cash. Only a man who lived his kind of life could create this feeling, and Hurt is perhaps the greatest representation of that. It's personal and listening to his last sung words it's literally as if we all were sitting by his deathbed.
Idc nelson	it wasnt an empire of dirt
Kasey Cox	I cry for myself and other family friends looking for hope in the savage life of addiction
Mike Nardi	Very powerful song but one thing about Johnny Cash who was amazing he had Fame, Fortune and He found his Soulmate and he led an amazing life with many ups and downs.  I think this is what makes this song so great he had it all and realized what really mattered was the people around him and when they were all gone he was left with a pile of dirt as he says because nothing really matters as much as the people that made it worth it.
Michel Motta	"everyone i know
goes away in the end"
Zxaoks	I like this song but I can’t listen to it without being sad afterward
nathan hopkins	i CANNOT listen to this song without crying..

vigilante Rocco	"None of us should take a second for granted; it seems the rich are more hurt that they cannot take their riches with them...  Well, at least he saw and seen what most people can only dream about.  And had talent that most people dream about.... I can. Relate to this song.....  Everyone should. Because whether rich or poor----we all have to die. "" But if the living walk above the dead, then wouldn't it be logical that the dead live above the living?..... I wasn't aware he did a lot of drugs....  But it doesn't surprise me...."

I'm happy that she agrees with this choice and will keep it until the day I die. I've done many things I wish I hadn't done, but you have to understand it gets to a point where you can't control it. Just go with the flow.
M Evans	I have always luved  Johnny Cash, but I knew that he didn't write this song.  NIN was about suicide very depressing. I'm suffer from manic depression so there is no judgement here. Rather hear about Johnny's regret than a finale end...
ムクホーク	This is a good song to tell your friends and family to watch before you commit suicide. 😘

Richard Potter	Johnny made this song real.
Jay Batterson	Outstanding
M T	For you all out there , this wasn't one song , it was an album of covers recorded at sound city  , read the history- Cash was ill but he returned daily to record with Grohl  , Petty , etc . watch the docu about sound city - when it all ended Grohl bought the mix board and took it home - the huge board that made everyone from Fleetwood Mac to Nirvana and King Cash's last vocals is now owned by Dave Grohl and I bless him for saving it from the scrapyard .
George Barnes	This Is A Classic Song, By A Classy Musician, An Icon Of  This Age of Music...
Nate Rothman	"You will find that some covers never live up to the originals and others far surpass the original...this fits in the second one. No disrespect to Trent, but that is possibly the finest cover I've ever heard. I heard that video was the last thing Johnny did, not long after June passed. You look at the video, and I may be reading too much into this, but the way the video was done, with Johnny's life playing out, a small appearance by Rosanne, you may think Johnny knew he was dying, and did this to recap his life, as one last look back. It's also possible he sang that song for June. ""You are somewhere else, I am still right here."" RIP Johnny, thank you."

Daniel Price	😭
WarNekoMeow	I think this is one of the most human performances of all time. And I don't say that as a Johnny fangirl, I say it as a person who lives, hurts and watches the motion of time take its toll on everyone around them. This performance encapsulates the feeling of time to a degree that is haunting.  I probably sound full of myself and I'm sorry for that, I genuinely feel that this song is the greatest wakeup call to everyone to cherish what they had because in end, time doesn't give you a second chance to live again. So just live now and don't take your blessing for granted. I feel like that is what he was trying to say.
Friggity Friggity Funky	This is fucking beautiful
Oveja Negra	"Me lastime hoy
Para ver si todavía me siento
Me concentro en el dolor
La única cosa que es real
La aguja hace un agujero
La vieja picadura familiar
Intenta matarlo todo
Pero recuerdo todo
En qué me he convertido
¿Mi más dulce amiga?
Todos los que conozco
Se va al final
Y podrías tenerlo todo
Mi imperio de suciedad
Te voy a decepcionar
Yo te haré daño
Llevo esta corona de espinas
Sobre la silla de mi mentiroso
Lleno de pensamientos rotos
No puedo reparar
Debajo de las manchas de tiempo
Los sentimientos desaparecen
Tu eres otra persona
Todavía estoy aquí
En qué me he convertido
¿Mi más dulce amiga?
Todos los que conozco
Se va al final
Y podrías tenerlo todo
Mi imperio de suciedad
Te voy a decepcionar
Yo te haré daño
Si pudiera empezar de nuevo
Un millón de millas de distancia
Me mantendré
Encontraría una manera"

Marco Zepeda	Tears just rolled out of my eyes...
Curtis Marean	This guy has been through a lot in his life, and it comes out in the way he does the song. He was in this place for a long time.  You can see it in his eyes, and hear it in his voice. At least now he's at peace, I hope. RIP, Johnny.

Szymon Grabarczyk	"There are not many songs that I would consider ""Complete"". This one is."
beastmry	I've never cared for dislikes on a video, but 11k dislikes here makes me sad.
BadBianca123	Man, his cover brings tears to my eyes... you can feel his pain... damn, so powerful
james johnson	Love this song, reminds me of when I was existing day to day as a heroin addict...lyrics that describe any addiction... But now I'm coming on 3yrs clean n loving life... We do recover
David Carpenter	Johnny was, of course, not doing well when this video was made in 2002, but his wife June, who stands on the stairs looking concerned in this video, actually died before he did, in May, 2003. Johnny lasted a little less than four months after that.
Sophie ORTIZ	😘😘😘
Aishling Paige Hanlon	I love this song ❤️
Domingo Ruiz	Wow fantastic, no words only a wonderful song a wonderful voice
Dietmar Marecello	Sehr schöner Song, mit Liebe gesungen, Dankeschön.

C PP	Sehr schön, das Ende eines Lebens. Alles gute!
jack is rad	You will be missed
MusicInspire	I think Johnny got at least a glimpse of Solomon's take in just how vain life is in the pursuits of earthly pleasures and treasures. Empires of dirt is exactly what all riches on this earth really consist. I do not envy what the wealthy have. It's all vanity, dirt, perishable, the pleasures are fleeting because suffering always comes thereafter.
Heartbeat	and why am I crying?
ben ben?	ok boomer
Trip Reviews	Yes, so emotional, every time I see this video or hear this song it brings a tear to both my eyes. R.i.p Johnny.

Zachary D	It maken me 😭
Elliot Paulson	"Songs like this, as well as David Bowie's Lazarus, and Freddie Mercury's The Show Must Go On are so incredibly powerful.
You have these insanely talented artists who are facing death, and it is as if they pour everything that they are into those final pieces. The result is this incredible musical memento mori."
Samuel Browne	THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN  BY SOMEONE ELSE ....BUT IT PERSONIFICES HI LIFE..HIS STORY...HIS JOURNEY.....GO JONNY GO....RIP MR CASH...DONT HAVE TO WALK THE LINE NO MORE

Kathie Newman	"Really loved this Video! Had many friends turn to the needle like Johnny did! Something, always stopped me from doing it in any way, snort, or needle. I know now It was God  stopping me even though I had no idea it was Him then. I now know that still small
Voice I heard was from God and not me. I also saw many people healed from heavy  duty $300.00 a day habits. I love this song! The pain of this song  totally touched  my soul. Trent was a real
Blessing for making a tribute to Johnny Cash  by his song! Trent will be blessed! Love ya❤️🙏Kathie"

Teodor Kirov	I came here to see all the pretentious fucking comments.
Roger Faulkner's Home From Home	What a love song
Nick Feratu	This video still causes me to have such an intense wave of emotion, all these years after I first saw it. It’s painful to see Johnny Cash in such a frail condition, especially juxtaposed with the images of him looking strapping and young in his prime, but what a remarkable final statement the great man left us.  We were lucky to have him for as long as we did. God bless the Man in Black.

Michael Luccketta	How beautiful he made it. Long live the man in black.
Jack Nyx	"Can’t believe the music industry is upon collapsing. The sad thing is, I’ve started to learn about it in my college music course and the fact that it’s collapsing scares me since I have only just begun in the industry. People like Johnny Cash, and many others, for example Lead Belly, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Big Mama Thornton AND more were the start and the end of the blues into the beginning of the new era, country, and then rock and roll, and then BAM. 

Corona virus has left the industry in ruins, record companies haven’t changed and are still conning artists of their very own work. They’re called artists for a reason, as THEY make art, all the record labels do is promote the music and take the majority of the income, and then leave you in a lot of debt per album, and it just keeps growing..."

Greg Lynn	Seriously.... IS there a better drinkin' song.....
Pete Lewis	I think we all have our own life favourites (mine is Ian Hunter, formerly of Mott The Hoople) - but we all have to love and respect Johnny Cash, for what he is and what he has been - true to himself and the world...!

UNIVERSO DOS DOCUMENTÁRIOS	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

franksplace551	Yeah man it sure hits home in a variety of ways and in a way only Johnny Cash could present I mean he could make a bunch of woods at Folsom prison shed a tear or two
deadpoolnerd	When I hear Cash's rendition of the song I imagine a story. The story of one of the last few cowboys out west. He's done so much bad in his lifetime brawling drinking looting killing. But he still has his few close friends that try to influence him to a better life as they see times are progressing. Times change and as the once rowdy town begins to calm this cowboy doesn't, he doesn't accept it. Eventually the few people he has left must move onward and progress also, at his lowest now this cowboy reminisces on his adventures looks back on all the wrong he's done. He hurts himself cutting his hand to see if he can even identify pain after feeling nothing for all the pain he's caused. He sees society and the town has moved on his once closest friends moving on, he sulks now more alone than ever. Feeling regret of his actions, if only he found a way to progress. He looks at the riches he's stolen the gold the fancy watches nice clothes all the fat stacks of money, and realises for all of its worth it's dirt to him. He's let his friends down himself down, realising what did matter is now gone. So this cowboy must now live with the repercussions of his actions.

jggmcm	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US8lDHjgmV4
Wayne Beard	"Johnny Cash wrote what is considered the most romantic love letter ever. It shows what he was made of and where his heart was. The vulnerability he displays in every sentence is what earned it the most romantic ever written. 
I'm fortunate to have heard his music from the late 60s to this. 
I lost my dad earlier this year, my wife's mom passed away in February, in July my cousin was killed, in August my mom didn't make it thru open heart surgery.
I've never felt so lost in my life. 
I'm not a religious person, I believe our time here is what we are given and being good to one another means everything."
Toby	Ima listen to this until I dont cry

antonio carlos Machado	Good music
locke	0:12
Madea Simmons	His best song.  Because we all die with regrets.  We all have been through Hell. Even rich ppl or good looking ppl find Hell.  It seems like Cash found out what we all do in our twilight that love doesn't females can't love, and only males can love.
Matheus	Perfect song for Breaking Bad
K Bux	Whew. This song makes me tear up every time I listen to it. It’s incredible how the meaning is ever changing and evolving depending on the experiences of the artist performing it and the listener absorbing it.

J. W. Boatwright	This song never fails to bring tears to this United States Marine’s eyes. How many years ago! How many deaths I can’t let go. 😞. We know. The best of us never came home alive—if at all. My nineteen year old son came home a week after being deployed to Iraq. He arrived at Dover AFB—in a fucking silver box. 😔 The only thing that keeps me from eating a round is perhaps heaven isn’t a lie. Tanner, I miss you more than mere words can convey! Tanner, I’ll see you again—but not yet. I pray to a God that I’d like to believe in a whole lot more than I actually do: Father, if you love me, why won’t you set me free? ~MSgt J. W. Boatwright USMC (Ret.) 1st MARDIV, 1st LAR Bn, Alpha Company, 1st Platoon. MOS8541/0317. BTW, my dearest friend and brother, “Devil Doc” Collins (A Corpsman) and I are visiting Arlington National Cemetery today to visit my boy. “Doc” Collins and I were stacked at the Kuwait border together. Hurry up and wait... Despite the inaccuracies of history, the invasion of Iraq began 17 March, 2003–opposed to 20 March..  Sincerely yours, MSgt J. W. Boatwright USMC (Ret.) 1st MARDIV, 1st LAR Bn, Alpha Company, 1st Platoon. MOS8541/0317. OORAH !!!! Kick ass, take names , pop smoke... ‘Rah! 🇺🇸
jose vega	I don’t know why but this is one of the greatest songs we will ever see
GSD	"You need to listen to *The* *Downward* *Spiral* to get the true meaning of this song by Reznor and NIN. ♥️

""I wear this crown of shit"""
GSD	THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL.
Kevin Raney	I met him about 35 years ago at a theater at Rivergate Mall in Tennessee. He had his son with him.

Borys Liepshov	Forever!
123hunterbunter	Getting old sucks
B Man productions	Me stubbing my toe
King A	This brought me to tears..
Jude Caplin	Greatest cover thats ever been done or ever will be done. And the saddest damn video, look into June's eyes when she's looking at her husband, she knows she's going to lose him soon and is trying to come to terms with it, oddly enough she went first. Heartbreaking...
Jeffrey Banner	Losing June broke him; simple as that.
Der Besen	Q
Ron Cornett	trent could have never dreamed that hurt would have been turned into a masterpiece by the elder mr.Cash respect to both
Nate	We only get one life, make it count.
Janoby !	Imagine being the retard who doesn’t know who cash is and dislikes the video
UNKNOWNLEGEND	"There's a reason this song matched with ""Logan"".
""The true feeling. True inspiration""

Jacqueline Tolayo	if you do not believe in god you will never understand this song , he knew he fucked up when he sold his soul to the devil.
Maryangela	I always cry to this... ;-;
Gunslinging Bird	Once he touched this song it ceased to be a NIN song.
Harrison Holley	If God had a song to sing, this would be it! ❤
Guitar, Vocals, Keyboard	Absolutely beautiful cover. I'm not into country personally more a Punk and Metal guy but fking love Johnny. Great baritone vocals and gave his entire life to making great music. Such a shame most of today's generation are growing up with garbage pop chart music that heavily relys on autotune and machines rather than this kind of raw human emotion and passion that Johnny had behind his vocals.
Ramon Salas	I resonate with this more than anything
Shane Dubose	You can tell he meant every word he spoke in this song, it's very sad.
Thomas Colligan	So much feeling
Dynamic Opium	"I am drunk as fuck and crying to this like a little baby. There isn't a better cover of ones legacy like this. It's just so nostalgic, it just swallows you whole. You just feel all of his experience at once. The things you have yet to feel and live through, it's there in this 3:48 music video.  This is what being is like.
""There are more things in heaven and earth, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.""
Never give up, life is worth experiencing with all its pain and hardship. Leave your legacy upon this Earth no matter who you are, just be, just feel!"
XEMALLIARIS	Χτύπησα σήμερα Για να δω αν νιώθω ακόμα Εστιάζομαι στον πόνο Το μόνο πράγμα που είναι πραγματικό Η βελόνα σχίζει μια τρύπα Το παλιό οικείο τσίμπημα Προσπαθήστε να το σκοτώσετε όλα Αλλά θυμάμαι τα πάντα Τι έχω γίνει Ο πιο γλυκός μου φίλος; Όλοι γνωρίζω Φεύγει στο τέλος Και θα μπορούσατε να τα έχετε όλα Η αυτοκρατορία μου από βρωμιά Θα σε απογοητεύσω Θα σε κάνω κακό Φοράω αυτό το στεφάνι από αγκάθια Στην καρέκλα του ψεύτη μου Γεμάτο σπασμένες σκέψεις Δεν μπορώ να επισκευάσω Κάτω από τους λεκέδες του χρόνου Τα συναισθήματα εξαφανίζονται Είσαι κάποιος άλλος Είμαι ακόμα εδώ Τι έχω γίνει Ο πιο γλυκός μου φίλος; Όλοι γνωρίζω Φεύγει στο τέλος Και θα μπορούσατε να τα έχετε όλα Η αυτοκρατορία μου από βρωμιά Θα σε απογοητεύσω Θα σε κάνω κακό Αν μπορούσα να ξεκινήσω ξανά Ένα εκατομμύριο μίλια μακριά Θα κρατήσω τον εαυτό μου Θα βρω έναν τρόπο!!!
Hal Martin	This song is about heroin addiction, right?
gambit	I know this will probably get ignored, but I'm related to Johnny Cash, mostly my grandma's side of the family. and finding out this was his last song before his eventual death really hit me hard, so whenever I listen to it here I am trying to not tear up
Johanne Wells	Wow, such a powerful song and video. I just listened to both versions, both excellent but I do prefer Johnny Cash’s.
Mike	I found this song from logan
Marcos Lozza	Eternally sad
Sean Cronin	"God bring out the beauty that is inside us...
Lets look inside the wonder that we have become...
The world is amazing we are throwing electricity into you...
If i could start again/ we would find a way /love will find its way...
If you are alone in this ridiculous world we call home I  will find you...
Run to the cliff /Dive into the sea/Look into the mirror/wash your face...
Here we are in the garden ... How did you get in here"

Heikki Eronen	He used to look my father, well  He hated me, I hated him....
Terry B	what a fuckin awsome song!!!!! he was the shit.
John Cooper, Sr.	the most beautiful old man i have ever seen......... wow......
KIMwants2b inWONDERLAND	He covers this soo beautifully
Beachfox	After all this time, is still guts me how very different these lyrics hit depending on if they come from a 20-something pulling themselves of teen-angst, or from an 80-something with a lifetime behind them.  Rest in Power, Mr. Cash.
Guy Who ate a toaster	Anyone here after hearing CallMeKevin do his cover?
digbydt	When you feel that need to shed a tear, the man in black grants your wish, the saddest, most wonderful song sung like no other man could, straight from the heart...

Just Some Jersey Devil With Internet Access	"This is the human speaking. 

I've been that Low. I've been depressed enough to dig into my own arm to see if I still feel. For those that don't know, Depression is like a bottomless pit of staring-back Abyss. It always sees you, and unless your emotions drag you back out, You'll keep falling.

You stay strong for as long as you can, but often, you can't outlast it. You break down under the darkness. And no matter how much of a man society forced you to be, You cry. You bawl out, the emotional pain of the abyss too much for even the strongest man.
But then it gets worse.
You cry for days and days, nights and nights, untill either you are spared from the abyss, or fall deeper. Eventually, ""under the stains of time, the feelings dissapear"" as Johnny says, the terrible sadness goes away, but is replaced by something all the more horrible, because it doesn't need to be horrible. It doesn't need to hurt. 

It's emptiness.

Eventually, the abyss fills you with emptiness; emotionless, terrifying but without fear, hollowness where you wish the pain still was.

I sharpened my own nail to a point, cut into my own arm, because it hurt.

And because ""the old familiar sting"" was better than the emptiness of that abyss. Pain is better then the wretched holllowness that filled me those weeks.

If you have not experienced this, pray right now that you never do."
hailey wojtaszek	welp Im feeling it now 😧😭
David Oliveira	Here after Call Me Kevin's cover

Derek Sendrak	Aren’t we all so thankful that Rick Rubin INSISTED Johnny cover this song! Wow
X	There are so many wholesome comments that i cannot see the lyrics guy here :)
DK	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way

Johnny will always have a place in our hearts. RIP legend ❤️"
Ken Brome	I am not sure what affects me more, his voice and the song OR the video, just the way June looks at him is so loving and heartbreaking at the same time. What a legacy they both left to the world. Thank You Johnny and June !

A man and a song .
A man and a heart."
psycho life	His legacy will absolutely not be forgotten and will live on✊
Maximillian Forrest	The first time I heard this song some years ago it felt quite haunting. Even today the feeling is the same. For me the song portrays a man who has lived a life to the full but has lost all those he has ever loved, thus wishing those who inherit his wealth (empire of dirt ) a better life. It’s such a sad song because from experience I know once we lose those we love, we are left with nothing .
Oliver	What a song, what a voice...
Gabriel Meli	Nose que dice pero puta que me da pena weon 😂😂😂
Fake Fact	"He like want say to God 
Johnny Cash: oh god I done with this world"
Jay Groomes	Not a lot of songs make me cry. But this one does. And it makes me want to die. So I don’t listen to it
stoned rat in a suit	I have thought about it for a while now, and I just can't figure out how 10.000+ people dislike this song enough to make the effort of clicking the thumbs down.
Betty la poison	J'ai beau cherché, je ne trouve dans l'histoire de la musique populaire aucune chanson capable de rivaliser avec l'émotion que me procure celle-ci... Quand on y ajoute les images, elle devient un monument de réflexion introspective sur la fugacité de l'existence et la puissance relative des sentiments que les simples mortels ont à leur portée. Trent Reznor a écrit une magnifique chanson mais Johnny Cash l'a amenée au firmament de la culture pop. Chaque fois que je regarde ce clip, et dieu sait si depuis des années je l'ai regardé, l'émotion est intacte, un véritable miracle.
BigLean	"When I hear this song, I try to listen to 'I don't hurt anymore"" right after."

Daniel Rucker	This is story of my life kind of song, not even 30 yet and see that i hurt enough people to be hated by most around me
Ashanti McCormick	RIP LOGAN
Ismo Sihvola	THE MAN dressed allways the BLACK like STEVEN SEGAL
Gordon Goodenough	I love this - the lyrics, the accompanying footage, and the matchless vocals by Johnny Cash. I keep coming back to this song, and I don't know why exactly. Perhaps because it reassures me that despite all logic, I am not a completely emotionless husk, but still capable of feeling pain and sadness. And if I'm capable of feeling pain and sadness, maybe I'll feel happier emotions too.
Kilo Juliet	Once Johnny covers your song it's no longer yours
Natalie Jane	Only song that leaves me sobbing on the bathroom floor aha
Elliot Fabian-Fine	this is probably my favourite cover of any song
Jarod Crazy Indian	For everyone who is hurting, this is a part of you getting better. You're going to be OK. 🙂

Matteo Berard	Tables turn. Bridges burn. You live and you learn. Everyone leaves me in the end but I’m still here, in part thanks to music by Cage The Elephant, The 1975, Green Day, Radiohead, and of course The Man In Black. We’re all still here, no matter who we were before, or who we’ll be in the end, we are in the here and now.

wiskysadie	You are someone else, I am still right here. Story of my life.
Messy Marv	When he starts pouring out that glass of wine........
Joe Leasure	He was great, but this video is cut terribly.
Alfred Woolley	"Johnny Cash was courageous. We saw that when he performed concerts in prisons when his record label demanded that he didn't. We saw it when he released ""Bitter Tears"", and radio stations wouldn't play it because it was about Native Americans. He took out a full-page ad in Billboard magazine calling  radio djs ""gutless"" for not playing it. We saw it when, even though he wasn't an activist,  he wasn't afraid to show his opposition to the Vietnam war. He was frequently at odds with the mainstream country music community and with the Grand Ole Opry for these things. He didn't care. In the end, in this video, we see his courage again. He exposes himself and all of his vulnerabilities. How many of us could do that? In that, he still has his voice, though it's fading. He still has that power, though he's losing it. It's one of the bravest things I've ever seen."

Donald Clark	Me to I miss her
Jammsbro	I was introduced to this song in 1994 by a friend. The album became my all time favourite. When I heard it was covered I was cautiously optimistic. Never the biggest Cash fan (although never disliking him) I hoped he would do it good service. I was blown away by its power. Reznor has said that this should be the definitive version. For mainstream, yes. It should be. The original holds so much more power, yet this delivers so much more emotion. Two incredible sides of the same fractured coin. Bringing so much to so many. I have heard people commend Cash's genius for writing this masterpiece and while anger spawned, I now wish those people would hear the original and understand and appreciate just why both versions now need each other. One is great, when knowing both, they rise to a different plateau. Incredible and wonderous. This is what it means to take art and make art.
Korvyne	Trent Reznor is a Legend!! What a song. Every version.
Enrico Franchi	I like this cover song
Gerhard Buitendach	You are someone else...I am still here...you can have it all..my empire of dirt...I will find a way. Such awesome lirieks, and so accurate
depechemodecovers	I always get goosebumps all over my body when I watch that video ... it's like these lyrics were from Johnny himself, not from Trent Reznor ... or at least from Trent, especially for Johnny and nobody else.
one seventytwo	this is my funeral song if not im coming back to haunt all ya fuckers
Dirk Vd	Lost my best friend yesterday. And i was the one who had to make the final decicion. The line everyone goes away and ill still be here. Was really hard. But wisdom comes with the years and Johnny did had many years of wisdom. The world is fucked. Loyalty doesnt matter only for yourself as a loyal person. And the world is just fucked by a lack of loyal persons.

Антоан Стефанов	Great song
Daniel Butcher	He often reminded us that there is good and bad in all of us.  Remember that the next time you want to 'cance'l someone after hearing something they said or did.  How would you like to be judged by the world based on the worst thing YOU have ever done? Let's try to see all of people and love them for who they are, because we're all beautifully imperfect.
sunshine glow	I saw Johnny Cash and I love the man I love him so much and I know he's a Christian and I know he's in heaven and I'm a disabled veteran I saw him back in the 90s I'm also a recovering addict and I know mr. Cash was a recovering addict God bless you Johnny I'll be with you soon as Christ is coming back very soon keep looking up everybody if your Christian your redemption draws nigh

Mustardgas203	"Man. I grew up on Johnny Cash. I loved the NIN original song but not much else from them.
Trent says it best and I completely agree that that song shows how powerful a medium music is.
Drops ny heart every time I hear it, the video is a perfect marriage."

Jedi NITE	An old man with regret . Great song and we all should try and live life with little regret, meaning try to stay good.
Aziz Ali	Damn those Logan vibes
BeardedViking	To the 11 K people who didn't like this song you must not have a good taste in music.
John Sullivan	I literally destroyed my love life and the life I had with my son and didn't even mean to I love them so much I dont understand why I made the choice to push them away now there gone and im all alone with dreams and memories of what I use to be I'm sorry pop pop I didn't become the good man I wanted to actually be a family man I just became a failure
Keadon Boze	What an emotional gut-punch this is.
Richie C.	"When I told a huge JC fan that this was written by Trent Reznor, he did not believe it. Even though it was 3 years ago, and internet searches were definitely a thing, he did not want to admit it. 
The age of disbelief or wanting to only back your own narrative was unveiled to me that night."

flo66r6	Epic!
Oliver K.	this man deserves all the respect in the world, with how much he humbled over his final years.
William Thomas	My grandparents turned me on to Johnny Cash, when I was 3, with the album Folsom Prison Blues. I became a rock and grunge musician and moved to Nashville in 96.  The girl I was living with asked me to run to the grocery store.  As I'm walking down an isle I see this elderly couple, I did a double take and the man nodded to me and it was Johnny Cash!  I about died right there!  His rendition of this song is unsurpassed, hat's off to Reznor for recognizing it...

Zachary D	A dark horse rides throughout the wasteland of California herself in search for a beautiful woman who has a passion for a dark horse itself an ride the horse galloping is a saloon where she worked there and she saw a dark horse and ride it throughout the night and she gets off a dark horse and she pets him and she entered her house with her husband and her daughter bout 2 weeks old her dad was a office worker now old he smiles at his daughter son in law and his granddaughter there and they saw a dark horse there her father is looking at the horse and he said hey buddy it’s okay I got a nice stable for you as a fine tameable horse

SJ S	I know Johnny didn't write this song but his voice, so mature, aged to perfection to sing this song and give the lyrics the justice they deserve, I am grabbed and moved to tears every time I listen. Heart breaking but beautiful.
Mirtilo	this music hurts the soul
Omar Qatishat	"my uncle wrote a song called ""Hello from Johnny Cash: Harvest Moon"" in 2018 where he talks about how my grandfather's idol was Johnny Cash, and how he once had the pleasure of shaking The Man in Blacks hand, and how Cash then told my grandfather to say hello to his son, my uncle.
In the song there is a line that says: ""The train carrying loved ones always leaves too soon"" about Johnny's passing in 2003, and now that my grandfather has also passed, it only makes sense to listen to this song."
Charisma	i focus on the pain... the only thing thats real....

Cemor_Weiner	I have been looking for a tutorial on how to play the piano bit of this song because i just need to figure that out and i can put it and the guitar together if anyone sees this and can point me in the direction of one i would be extremely greatful
Ozan Atak	This is one of that rare cases where the cover is without a doubt better than the original.
Talia al Ghul	Shows how brilliant Trent Reznor is to have someone like Johnny Cash cover one of his songs.
Suzhaine Cinas	This song was too deep that made me cry .. :(

AY ZC	I admire Cash so much, he was like me, then I found God. Love that he wasn’t ashamed to express his beliefs 🙏🏼
Frank H	One of the Greatest!
Sergio Barriga	This is my favorite song. I'm learning to play guitar currently and my goal is to be able to play this song. Listened to this for years and soon I'll get to play it.
Josh	What I think is SO special about this song is that you don't have to know Johnny cash or who he was to literally start crying when you hear the words. Because we can all relate - we all have been hurt, we all deal with pain, we all deal with suffering.
Pamela Smith	Love it
Flash Inthepan	Johnny sold his soul a long time ago...like all the rest. RIP
Jennifer Ferguson	Best cover song ever
Brooke Bailey	This is one of those songs that gives you goosebumps...

Daniel Francisco	Really hurts...... Thanks Mr. Cash
erick sanchez	I listened to this song before I almost died in a motorcycle crash...
Stéphane Thirion	Very beautiful
horseman528	"""You can have it all, my empire of dirt"" says it all. I think Johnny Cash would agree with this verse in Isaiah 40:6-8, ""The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: The grass withers, the flower fades, because the spirit of the Lord blows upon it: surely the people are grass. The grass withers, the flower fades: but the word of our God  shall stand forever."""
Emily Kavanagh	I love his version of this song.  It is as good, if not better than, Nine Inch Nails' version.
Vanilla Games	Most people think this is the song of a broken man. Johnny Cash refused. He didn’t go out with a puff of smoke and a last hurrah. He went out with a piano, guitar, and microphone.
Reage Leozinho	The Walking dead
Michael C	This song is so sad that it makes me want to shit in everyone I hate mailboxes.
David Franks	Were the  guys in 9 inch nails estatic when the man in black asked to cover their song?
MajesticFirebird	"Girls: omg you didn't cry during titanic? Do you have any emotions?
Me:"
Shaun Ladden	11 thousand people seem to have a problem with this track. Idiots.
Alex Robinson	Trent Reznor, of Nine Inch Nails, who originally wrote this, said this is Johnny Cash's song now. Lovely tribute.
C D	I’m a recovering addict, but i think even if I wasn’t this version of this song is so cutting and compelling.  It’s terribly beautiful.
Sebastian Neff	Its so funny how people don't know this is a cover of nine inch nails
Fausto Motta	Muy buena cancion gracias por esta
Xyrein	I didn’t know he was dead 🤧
Benjamin Vockenberg	There isn't much that affects me emotionally... but this song.. I love to feel something.

dusty hunt	freddie mercury
Forzafan456	Logan trailer anyone
BeerMan Inc.	If you disliked this, you have no soul...
Itsgarpson	"The meaning of this song is basically from king Solomon from the bible; the book of Ecclesiastes. Everything on this earth is vanity if we're just doing everything for our selfish desires because in the end is death, that's when God will judge us if we belong to him or "" Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ 23 And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’"" That he explains in this song that all his riches that he had on this earth were all things he wouldn't be able to take with him in the afterlife. Seems like he wasn't fulfill with life because maybe he saw, in the end, it was all vanity. I love johnny cash, but the song says it all how he felt in the end. Let's try to learn from cash; start to care for one another and come to christ who is the truth and the life."
Robbie Oller	He closed that piano to walk with a flute piano was junk he got a grand piano on delivery
Alev Gegin	Still walking the line....Ur the greatest of all!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

random words	Me when I get late for class and can't get in Zoom
Graham Thomas	Its a beautiful recognition of our unworthiness. In this admittance lies absolute freedom let the pain swallow you up and be free! You can''t win. Surrendure and be whole my brothers and sisters. We are worthy in Gods eyes. You can't earn that so admit defeat, give up the fight.
P4LAPI	this damn song almost got me crying..so buitiful
John Wayne	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"
Owen York	Music is very subjective, but this has to be the greatest music video ever. So painful to watch.
ali habibi	King cash 👑
JOAO RAFAEL TORRES GONCALVES	"gostei muito vc e 
muito bom"
Robert Gary	Interesting that when Johnny sings this song the meaning changes from a young drug adelled youth to a life’s swan.
Jennie Mills	I have never been able to hear this song without crying. The original never did that to me!
Rose gold	I don't think i could ever watch this video and not get goosebumps.
sarChristian	God loves you John
Dawn Lewis	Whose autograph is on his guitar?  G something H something....
N K	Am I the only person that when I hear this I remember chow from hangover ?

Mr Oknoproblem	Someone close to the end
Astra Kerala	"♥♥♥♥♥

♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥"
HW Johnson	its a sad song he is alone
A Bored Geek	The most amazing cover song of all time that the original band disowns it and lets it belong to Cash.
The Retro Theater	What have I become? The most poignant line ever spoken about how it feels to be a human adult facing death soon as he looks back upon his life, his marriage, his career, his fatherhood, his friendship to others, etc, etc, etc...As I look at my life and things I have done and not done...scarred with tattoos on my body from a different (or exactly the same) me, my empty home from my divorce ten years ago, and  how at almost 50 years old I am the product of the answer to the question this song asks. What...what have I become? It is like our lives are like movies at the theater...some of us are hits and have long runs while others like Cobain and Hendrix fell way too young, and then me at the very middle of my existence on this rock called Earth...I could go any day now. And once our movie has had its run, we are boxed up and put away into the annals of time, seldom remembered, as life goes on and new movies come and go.
Steeve Daw	If Carlsberg Special Brew did cover versions... This would probably be the best ever...
Val	Well shit I'm only 25 yet this song already hit me harder than my dad used to.
Andrija Jovanovic	"when he said ""I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real"" I felt that..."
Doug Jones	Imagine that the feeling of hurt is the most vulnerable side of love. Hurt is connected with love.
Alex Chiperi	This song is so real, you can feel it running through you...
Riders on the storm	"All is nothing in the end!
You can't take anything with you, except ones self.
Although!!! ones self could be worth its weight in Gold!
That's what Jesus tried to say!
So...
How rich is your soul?
How much are you willing to spend?
How much are you willing to invest?"
bruh man	i miss my grandpa and he reminds me of him
Hriat Puii	❤️❤️❤️
Michael Panov	Grown man tears, something you gotta deal with...
Manik Premi	This is best song I have heard
Alex Sheperd	This cover feels like someone at the end of their life realizing that the hospital and all the procedures are all that’s keeping them alive and accepting it’s better to slip away before they’re too gone to be themselves anymore
Lori Brien	I remember my son played the song for my dad not too long before he died
Lori Brien	Love this song!! Done by him!!
Scott Thomasen	As a young boy a long time ago I complained as my father took me to see Johnny Cash in live South Lake Tahoe.  Now my father has passed and I wish, as an adult now I could thank him for giving me a chance to have seen this American treasure in person.  I can still see the screens playing movies of trains steaming hard on either side of the stage.  And thank you to this who made this video, and recorded this song with Johnny Cash.  Beautiful.
Anthony Wright	Eddie....
Average Joe	Nine inch nails did it better. But they both did justice to these lyrics
JealousElephant	A really moving song. I just need to know one thing, who's his Swedish friend??

aksay arda	I hurt myself today and I broke some rules that I wrote... I am really sorry my friend. You never know what I did but I am always in pain because of that. Don't worry is not a problem for me... Over time, I get used to this pain but I never forget. I love you bro and I am really sad about our situation. I wish I can handle with all of them but I can't... So, you never see me again and I will never go back... I love you so much and because of that I have to leave you... Please forgive me bro... Goodbye and take care of our paintings and the room that we built together... Goodbye.

AllEarsIm	This came up in autoplay and I wasn't ready. Crying now
LinLad	"I am 19 years old and every time I listen to this song, I sincerely cry, as if I lived his life and felt it all on myself... Thanks to this song, I completely overload, begin to think again about what is happening in my life. All the difficulties, all the losses, everything is not infinite. Everything has a property to end, it must be accepted. There are people who find it very difficult to live with the loss, but such is the fate, and nothing can be changed ... Live, enjoy every moment and never think of the bad! All the time we struggle with problems and obstacles, we become stronger both physically and spiritually. My dad says, ""If you don't have a goal, you don't have a sense to live,"" ""You've got one goal, put a new one on it and get it done."" Without the purpose and desire to achieve it, then you will live a life, and have achieved nothing. All good luck and good mood, though after the song is so sad ..."

Contour man	I love the words to this song.  Crown of thorns.  Johnny realizes his accolades are meaningless and only relationships have meaning in the end.  Deep.
Perineum Sunning Guru	. I grew up with Nine inch nails, but Jonny's version is very powerful.

Nigel TT Chikanya	Old timer, you are the best there is!
2 Steak Sandwiches	I’ve had discussions with my 94 year old grandfather and they are deepest conversations I’ve ever had and this song is like his life...The big strong man I knew is frail and dying. I treasure him even though he has made so many mistakes and hurt people. The regret in his heart is palpable and he has spent the last 10 years making amends. I think a lot of regret is his time in WW2. He won’t talk about it....ever. In the end, we are all human. Imperfect.
Grigoris Vlogs'n'more	11k dislikes I can't believe this

Take Off Your Blinkers	One of the most beautiful, yet saddest songs I have ever heard, in almost 50 plus years here.
LESTER RAWLINS	"This was Johnny’s Goodbye song to us.  He recounts the joys of his life, but he also
shows the ravages of old age that we must all face unless we are taken out at a
younger age.  ""Everyone I know goes away in the end."" All my friends have died. This includes his wife June. Everyone he has been close to has died, and now it’s only him.  It’s a sad song, an old man’s wish to return to the good times.  May Johnny be returned to the good times and perhaps joined again to June.  Who knows, maybe he has been reunited with June and his old time friends in an afterlife.  I hope so.  RIP Johnny, we miss your kind of country music, and we miss you and June."
Scott	Greater, and I think more moving than listening to Johnny sing, is to watch this video with the sound muted. On the face and hands, and in the eyes of this icon, is a life lived most of us could never imagine, let alone experience. It reads deep into every line we see, when we're not listening to those lines sung
Pablo González Leitón	Espectacular interpretación
Cameron McCormick	If this song doesn’t play at my funeral I’m not going

Angelo Fabiani	Big
Darkwing Duck	"I'm absolutely livid...Johnny Cash covered Hurt, you guys. The goth country boomer wannabe. Not to mention he fucked it up. This isn't a song about your dying wife, asshole. It's from The Downward Spiral, the greatest album of all time and it's about becoming God and then killing yourself. That fuckhole even changed the line from ""I wear this crown of shit"" (fitting) to ""I wear this crown of thorns"" like he's the second coming of cactus country ass jack jesus or something and we should worship him for his contributions. I am not happy."

Outlaw Dingo	Rip Johnny Cash. Man myth legend. You left your mark on the world an impact so big youll be remembered for eternity even if time stops you'll live on in the clouds
Mark -	"So many of these singers like Cash (Elvis, Ray, etc) started out singing gospel songs and hymns and had a strong spiritual background and upbringing.  But because there was no money in it,  they moved into the secular music arena and basically ""sold their soul"" for the sake of money and fame.  After the drugs, failed marriages and relationships, and a host of other compromises and regrets, a song like this is born.     ""If I could start again, a million miles away; I would keep myself; I would find a way."""

Jan Hammeken Buch	"Your life defines you. The wins give you joy, the losses hardens and marks you. Wear the scars with pride, because they tell everyone around you, that you survived and came out stronger on the other side. Accept your mistakes, learn from them and try to avoid them in the future. Let them help you become greater in the eyes of God and your fellow men and women. And treat everyone as you yourself expect to be treated. Kindness never comes back bad. But on a dark day, it may come back as a glimmer of light, that guides you home.
Strength to you all.
Greetings from Denmark."

Tripple_X_Panda	This make me cry everytime i listen to it. I remember listening to Johnny songs with my grandpa when I was little kid up to 14 when iblast seen him I'm now 18 and he nearly died recently and I haven't yet seen him. I have been calling him everyday. It hurts a lot because the one you love the most that taught yoy things that no one else would is near his last years of being on this planet that is in dying need of help. Love you grandpa 👴 ❤
C.R Hammer	This song makes me feel like a piece of shit and want to be better.
David Thurmond	I wish I could talk to one of his kids because my dad was out there in dice ark when they where young working in a cotton field and said he remembers when Johnny cash got off of a b John Deere tractor and grabbed his guitar and started up the railroad tracks and said he could make more money singing than he could driving a oil slinging tractor
R C	The best example of old age covering a new age song.

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

Anita Contreras	I hear this song when thinking of my mom she was in allot of pain and suffering and thought I didn't notice it but I did I felt her pain and every night I would lay in bed I would cry knowing she was suffering in pain I know she's resting now but watching her through that pain took a part of me I still cry thinking of her I wish I could have said my last goodbyes 💔💔💔

Adalagarzi	"I want everyone to take a moment. Take a moment to listen to this, the melodies, the somber tone, the absolute tragedy and intensity of this magnificent track. The beautiful-yet-tragic song. Now, think about the song WAP, which has more views, and being glorified the song of the generation.

What kind of backwards world am I living in."
Fair Chandler	Is everyone hurting in 2020 yet? Is anyone out there waking up yet? What will it take you to do so?  Stop 🛑 ✋ for a moment. Ask yourself one question? Have you found Jesus yet? Time is nigh, time is so nigh. Jesus is crying and praying for you to yield to his tug on your heart. Repent and accept and finally  seek the wholesome truth you have always been looking for.
Tennisman12	"Mr. Cash, your music lives on. I teach a preschool music class and they love,""I've Been Everywhere...... Man!"""

xGRGaming	You know what really sucks? The fact that there’s people in this world that will go their entire lives and will be gone from this earth without knowing who Johnny Cash is/was or have heard his music. Think about it. I pity them. And at the same time I feel lucky I was able to get to know his music and like him the music of many other great artists and bands.

I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts

You are someone else

Susan Dudak	I believe this is Johnny's best work of his life.  He wrote this shortly after his beloved June passed away.  He died about 3 months after her.  She was his life.  I cry and cry every time I hear this.  Has to be the most emotional honest song I have ever heard.

Mateo Arredondo	"I miss my dad so much

He’s not dead but I don’t know where he is. He burned his house down a few months ago after he had a mental breakdown and tried to commit suicide along with that. I miss him so much! He may have been not the best dad in the world but the time I was in made him good. At my moms house I had to become an adult basically and do lots of chores and take care of the other siblings. My dads was the opposite, I had no real chores or responsibilities their and could do whatever I wanted all day. I remember watching movies with him late night and laughing while being father and son. I remember playing games while there, relaxing and having the childhood I liked. Being able to escape from the early days of my stepbrothers being here when it was hell. He would do anything for me, he would let me watch a movie or use the tv if wanted to even though he was using it at the moment. I would do almost anything to see him again and just be the way it was. The house I took my first steps in is now ashes inside with a destroyed 2nd floor. When he burned it down he came to my moms and tried to kill himself in the back yard with a big knife. My stepdad found him early morning and called the police saving his life. He went to a psych ward for a bit and was let out later with a restraining order against us. It’s been over 180 days since I saw my dad. If your reading this somehow dad, I love you, and I hope to see you soon someday-your son.

Edit: thanks for the kind words people, I was on the bathroom floor crying when I wrote that and was just looking for some people to hear something from. I’m sincerely thankful for what you have said, and parabellum, fuck you."

ZieOmega	Trent Reznor gets it writing these lyrics as he was always 2 steps ahead of reality. Seeing Johnny Cash perform this brings the lyrics to reality as he lived it. RIP Johnny.... your performance on this brought emotion, visualization and tears to so many who never experienced this level of past years of a performer.

Paul Ksefvwefvwefvwerv	"Alcoholic self loathing is the worst. Poor me, poor me, poor me another drink. Here’s a guy that has it all but he can’t find the forgiveness in Jesus Christ. I’ve done some shitty things to people when I was a drunk but it doesn’t define who I am. Quitting drugs and alcohol 20 years ago was the best thing I ever did. Too bad Johnny couldn’t get sober.
I feel sorry for his wife who is a good woman but thinks she’s to blame for his unhappiness. Practicing alcoholics are too selfish and self centered to empathize with those who get hurt the most.....the ones that love you. 
RIP Johnny."

The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."""

And I said, yup! that Johnny cash!! I said all the kids at school are talking about it. And she said, the kids at school are talking about Johnny cash??? And I said yup! And then I should her the video and her face was glued to the screen the whole time in amazement. I just thought about that and had a tear come to my eye because she died a number of years ago, but I know that knowing that johnny cash was popular again made her really happy at that moment

Vanessa Norris	Even though this song was originally written about heroin the lyrics apply to a wide audience of non users. I personally and I think that most people can relate to broken thoughts they cannot repair for example.  You are someone else and I am still right here like how I feel stagnating with depression and ptsd. Unless you’ve led a very sheltered and  begnine life. I feel almost everybody can relate. The clip do very moving.

Ricky Rincon	To anyone who watched this because they are depressed like I did. Just know you are valued. You really are.
Ronan Lima	"Machucado
 Eu me machuquei hoje

Para ver se eu ainda sinto

Eu me concentro na dor

A única coisa que é real


A agulha abre um buraco

A velha picada familiar

Tento eliminar tudo isso

Mas eu me lembro de tudo


O que eu me tornara

Meu mais doce amigo?

Todos que eu conheço

vão embora no final


E você poderia ter tudo isto

Meu império de sujeira

Eu vou desapontá-lo

Eu vou fazê-lo sofrer


Eu uso esta coroa de espinhos

Sobre meu trono de mentiras

Cheio de pensamentos quebrados

Os quais não posso consertar


Sob as manchas do tempo

Os sentimentos desaparecem

Você é outro alguém

Eu ainda estou bem aqui


O que eu me tornara

Meu mais doce amigo?

Todos que eu conheço

vão embora no final


E você poderia ter tudo isto

Meu império de sujeira

Eu vou desapontá-lo

Eu vou fazê-lo sofrer


Se eu pudesse recomeçar

Milhões de milhas daqui
Eu me manteria

Eu acharia um caminho"

pcpete911	"Watch and observe, children.  They PLAY their instruments and sing with 
competence.  They know their instruments and have spent a lot of time 
practicing and learning their skill.  No Autotune.  No computerization 
doing it for them.  This is something called talent.  Talent was a skill
 from decades ago before Autotune, before computerization, before the 
record industry picked young people to become stars based on visual 
appeal and how far a person would go with publicity stunts to create 
shock value.  These talented musicians of the past had creativity, 
commitment, flair, skill, and put in a lot of time writing and polishing
 their songs.  Many of them read what is called sheet music.  Sheet 
music is a kind of language for music using what is called notes.  Sheet
 music and notes kind of equate to learning how to write language and 
use what is called grammar.  Grammar are the rules and guidelines of 
language.  Music has a grammar to it, as well.  In both writing language
 and music, creativity may be used to create magnificent songs, such as 
the one on this video.  However, you will have to learn what is called 
discipline.  Discipline requires something called work.  Discipline and 
work will give you the means to learn how to actually sing and play 
instruments on your own without computerized assistance.  Once you 
become good with singing and playing instruments, something called your 
self-esteem will improve.  You will develop a sense of what is called 
accomplishment, like these young lads in the video."

Evelyn Ruiz	"We lost Vincent Nava yesterday, one of the most unique souls to ever roam the surface of this earth, most iconically known for his legendary skateboarding. He showed the world power, work ethic, greatness, fearlessness, passion, heart, and using falls to rise above like burning ashes rising to become a Phoenix again. My heart and soul, and deepest condolences go out to his mother, sisters, family, brothers and to everyone in 10C41. Vince left his footprints, and in behalf of the universe, I would like to thank God and you all for sharing his talent and carisma with us. 

With love, sincerity, and respect, Ms. Evelyn Ruiz

& May Vincent Nava forever shred in peace, without any police harassing & be able to BS Smith the biggest rails he couldn’t even begin to imagine! May the Lord forevermore bless his soul 🦋✨🤍♾"

cathy stewart	I love him
mabala jacob	What a song ...
umut öztürk	To mornings, evenings, sunrise to sunset, to the most exciting moments, to love, to separation ... To the beautiful things we can live in this life or to all the unfinished moments left in us. In short, a great person with a voice that goes well with all kinds of things. You can still play and sing so well in our heads. Even if you migrated away; Being a legend, being a musician and most importantly touching the heart of someone from such distant and being universal is still the best thing you do ..
umut öztürk	Sabahlara, akşamlara, gün doğumuna gün batımına, en heyecanlı anlara, aşka, ayrılığa.. Şu hayatta ki yaşayabildiğimiz  güzel şeylere veya içimizde kalan tüm yarım kalan anlara. Kısacası her türden şeye yakışan sese sahip müthiş insan. Hala kafalarımızda bu kadar güzel çalıp söyleyebiliyorsun. Göçüp gitmiş olsan da; efsane olmak, müzik adamı olmak ve en önemlisi bu kadar uzaklardan birinin kalbine dokunup evrensel olabilmek hala en iyi yaptığın şey... @johnnycash

My Space	We all are a prisoner of this song and we often don't even know it. Some of my poems were inspired by this acceptance.
Марина Попова	Кайф
TiTaNiUmCrYstAL	"3/4 of the video: *kalm*

Brian Smith	June looking over him makes me cry.  Oh Johnny, dear Johnny...is what I see.
Llewellyn James Kinnaird	"As someone trying hard to get wealth  , it's refreshing to see someone who has passed that bridge and shares their view with you. 
It let's you take a refreshing step back. 
We often put our happiness on that one thing we are trying to obtain. Love (if we had that partner, we would be happy), money,  fame ,children, degree, or a great social life . 

When in reality you probably wont find it on earth. I remember Goggins saying once you get there, then what ? 
 With the way the world is going , putting faith in Christ seems the only proper solution for me. 
Il still work towards my goals , but I'm not expecting total fulfilment from them ."

calvin marin	My dad liked his music he died August 24 and this song means alot
Fibse	Yooo I don‘t even like this guys music but this shit is so real, it touches everybody. I mean I mainly listen to hip-hop and not country but this dude is a legend. The pain in his voice is just too much...
Jesse Lackey	I have tried to play this song on guitar, (it's not difficult) and sing it at the same time. I am 39, lived a tough life, but I now realize I cannot sing this song like him, I have not earned the right too. Amazing musician-American Icon. Johnny Cash.
Aaron Richard	"The second time he says ""everyone I know goes away in the end"" really gets me. With the context of aging and ""you are someone else, I am still right here"" is so bitter because it suggests people change so drastically in their lives that you can get to know them and  they can completely become someone else"
ZapStrapZak	that hurt
Aaron Richard	"It's when he first says ""everyone I know goes away in the end"" with the pic of who I assume is his mom that always gets me right in the feels"

handholdinghomie	"Mr Johnny is surrounded by gold, chalices, a feast and beauty, but they don’t glimmer with happiness. The lighting is dim. He’s become a king, but with a cold struggle, where he’s now old and tired and missing the people he loves. 

What a magnificent man."
Shelly 🍁	Nine inch nails
Darvin Molina	A true legend
Edlyn Nieves	I remember going to Vegas and someone was singing this song. There was this really old guy in a wheelchair and he said “Johnny cash!” He was so exited. That made my whole day

Cameron Cheromiah	Living this song....

Thomas Hansson	I'm only 47 but I feel the pain, the regrets and what if's. It's always there. Like Elvis said, you can have it all but if you're not happy. What have you got?
CZR	Seen it all had it all ultimately lost it all
Herbinator_88	Arguably better than the original from NIN.
MARSBELLA1	Its about addiction - I dont understand how no one in the comments gets this. Addict in Greek means slave. The original song is about heroin addiction ''the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting'' - Johnny suffered addiction all his life and his wife and his family saved him. I ve read his autobiography let alone seen the film ''walk the line'' - how do none of you know this?
Adrian Almaraz	I remember that I was walking home Lisette ng to this song and I felt depressed even before, I feel that life will end
BicentricOwl76	Johnny Cash will live forever in his songs

Neyl Diniz	I don't know how many times I've heard this song! the best of all time!
jerch	This is one of the most emotionally powerful songs/videos to ever be produced. This is a man singing about his life and death in front of your eyes. I hope Johnny managed closure on this one.
Jason Bowen	The last song Johnny Cash ever recorded ended up being the best he ever did for sure.
james thetruth	Cash is expressing all the regrets we all have in life. The loss , the missed opportunities,  bad decisions,  lost relationships. And  it's  true, no matter  how well a life you have lived, we are imperfect.
Kris Swanson	I’m not crying you’re crying

Kolasau	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

Fabrizio D'Alonzo	September 2020. Still the Best Video Ever Made. No doubt. No contest. No match.
GetSmokedScrub	"This song needs to be heard more. This man died with so much regret and expresses how even at the top your life can still be unfulfilled. Being famous doesn't make you happy. Being rich won't make you happy. The riches come from within YOU and the choices you make through life. This man lived long enough to watch all his loved ones pass away...and he would trade all his fame  for those opportunities back. 
We  have 1 life. 1 chance to make it the way we want it to. Johnny left behind us his wisdom and greatest mistakes. Honor him by following his words. 
God bless everyone ❤"

Nathan	"Dude be rich and successful, but has the tenacity to preach about how age has ruined him and everything he once had. 

The song is great and so is he, but dudes be ending their sad lesser lives on a better note than how he's taking it. Maybe if his life hadn't been so good, he'd be able to bear with the pain. To take the good with the bad."
I pray to George Carlin	Trent Reznor said Johnny Cash owns this song now. For the original singer to say that compliment about a remake really says something. I am Honestly not a Cash fan until now. This song is absolutely beautifully perfection!
AnimalAce ace	I feel like i'm cheating looking up the ending of a game. Is this what I have to look forward to? This is chilling.

Mike Shvedov	F...K ME... so much PAIN in NIN song... WOW
SkilletsUSMC	This song pisses me the fuck off. Johnny Cash didn't need to cover Trent to have a legacy. It's theft of the most personal type to cover a song like this. Trent's version is the real version. Johnny's legacy is outside of this cash grab. I love JC but hate this cover
Nick B	A legend if there ever was one. Bravo!
Kut Kut	👏👍💯
Levi Carroll	Why did this tear me up so bad
Bill Beason	"Johnny and I would make collections of songs as possible covers for him to sing, and we’d send them to each other. “Hurt” was one that I sent. There were maybe 20 songs including that one on the mix I made, and it wasn't one that he responded to. But I had a strong feeling about it, so on the next compilation, I included that one again. Because of the way the Nine Inch Nails song sounds, I think it was hard for him to hear it. So I sent him the lyrics, and I said, “Just read the lyrics. If you like the lyrics, then we’ll find a way to do it that will suit you.”

He listened to it with the lyrics sheet and said, “If you feel strongly about this, we can try it.” We recorded at my house in Los Angeles. We built all of it from scratch. It’s an acoustic song, so it was recorded as a smaller acoustic song than it ended up becoming, and through overdubs, we built all the drama that’s in the song to support the power of the words and the way Johnny was delivering them.

He was at a time where his health was failing, and I tried to pick songs that made sense lyrically for the way his voice was sounding. There were times when his voice sounded broken. He tried to turn that into a positive in the selection of the music. He was awfully troubled by the way his voice was sounding. A lot of times during the process, he would be down on himself. He could always rely on his voice, and at this stage he couldn’t. It was a real struggle for him. But then, when we put everything together and it was done, he would love it.

This is another song where I can’t think of the song without seeing the video. The first time I saw it, I just cried. It really upset me. It’s a really beautiful piece of art and I’m proud of him for letting people see it. When his management first saw they were like, “Nobody can ever see this.” And it was really Rosanne [Cash], his daughter, that made the case to Johnny that, “You’re an artist — this is what you do, and you have to show this.” He was like, “You’re right.” He agreed. And the video came out. She was the one.

-Rick Rubin"
Sarah Elizabeth	Two AMAZING men my grandmother got me into, Johnny Cash...and Elvis Presley...I've been listening to them non-stop. Tomorrow marks 4 years since she passed...fly high.
charlotte ball	The word Legend is used to freely these days!!!! If I was a gambling person, I'd put my money on Jonny Cash making musical history. Only time will tell. His influence & contribution to music speaks for itself!! It's artists like him, who have provided the latest generation with a blueprint on how to have 3 + decade year long career. If your not a genuinely talented artist, you need to keep reinventing yourself. Those, that need to use choreographed dance routines, costumes & pyrotechnics i.e. Madonna/ Rihanna fit that category. The ones left, only need to write, play & sing the music that comes from their soul!!!!
Fábio Augusto da Silva Constâncio	F for the king.
Kyle Lee	I don't cry very much. But this song just gets me so damn sad. I could listen to this song for an hour straight. I have immense respect for this man even though he was way before my time. Anyone who takes his last days to send a message like this to other people is a legend in my book.

Bruna Eduarda	"It's interesting how the old age make us questionate what was the meaning of all that. I mean literally all of that, the feelings, wishs, actions, reactions, no actions... I see and hear so much of desperate in Cash's version, something like ""I'm sorry okay? I fucked all up, wish I could have another chance, and maybe when I come to this point again all this regret would be replaced with resignation: I did better."
David John	"Not many songs that grab my heart and bring a tear to my eye

aidan	ACTUALLY listen to the lyrics he is legitimately describing self harm,drug addiction, abuse, neglect, and self loathing his whole life, cash dealt with MDD major depressive disorder his whole life. in this song it proved it doesn't go away lol best of luck.
JLB95	I love revisiting this song at various points in my life. Different circumstances put a different spin on it and generate different emotions. Absolutely beautiful song.

Mhartain	Run it up a flagpole and salute.  One of the best covers, ever.  I don't know who created the video, but its a masterpiece.  Having to represent this amazing song visually is an impossible task.  The videographer(s) simply nailed it.  A fitting tribute to an unforgettable artist.
d reed	If you watch walk the line this makes sense
Erick Blanco	"Es cierto que no es la más triste que he escuchado, pero me pone sentimental la letra. Un hombre que su vida fue de error tras error, que alejaba a todas las personas a su alrededor con sus acciones y mentiras (La misma letra lo dice: ""¿En qué me he convertido? En mi más dulce amigo?""), que vivía sus últimos días solo por vivir ya que no tenía el más mínimo motivo para hacerlo. Y que su mayor deseo era el poder volver al pasado y no cometer los mismos errores. Lleno de sentimientos de impotencia por el simple hecho de que no podía hacer nada, solo vivir esos últimos días arrepintiendose de todo. El cantante murió un año después del lanzamiento de está canción, era su canción de arrepentimiento"

JoeyB	Viewers, please spare a few minutes to listen to this song I wrote about my brother who took his life 12 years ago due to a non diagnosed mental illness. He was a very angry young man who struggled with voices inside his head and visions of religious figures. He often mentioned that he had seen Saints/Angels at the end of his bed. For many years our family struggled with his unprovoked violence and anger. Countless Police calls were made due to his violence.  Although he hurt us a lot growing up, we still all loved him. Unfortunately, he was only ever diagnosed with anxiety from many doctors and eventually took his own life by jumping from the top of Church. For all his faults he was my brother and I loved him dearly!  It would mean a lot if you could listen. Thank you:)  https://youtu.be/ww6txXSHECs

Justin Raphael	A few years ago before my father passed away due to sudden organ failure at the young age of 40, he told me this was his favourite song. I forgot all about it, and I have found it. I always thought this song would let me find salvation and the truth behind his death, but as I think more about it, the answer to me is that it doesn't matter. Death is natural and is inevitable, and can come at any time. I loved my father, but he was no perfect man. He and my mum would always fight, he had mental health issues, and relied on welfare checks. Yet he still fought hard for me, my mum, and brother. This song gives me the answer that no one is perfect and nothing matters in the end, and in fact, it probably won't. But what I do know is that the only thing that will matter in death is regret and for what you will become at the end. My father probably had much regret im his life, maybe for not taking the right paths in life or now isn't able to see me and my brother grow up and live with my mum in the future and he wasn't a saint when he died. He never had the chance to find salvation or meaning, but maybe he already did or was already searching for it, I'll never know. From this song and my fathers death, there is only one thing that's certain to me: Death is always closeby and inevitable, striking you at any time and any place, and nothing will ever matter in the end, as your conscious will cease or pass on to the afterlife. But that you also must live with no regret, forgiving yourself for what you've done and all the things that will come and happen and no matter what, you must be content with what you've become and accept it. This is not a religious philosophy, but it can be, and it is my truth. I just felt the need to share it. Thank you Johnny Cash and thank you Dad, Philip Choi 1978 - 2018

Max B	After reading Johnny Cash The Life by Robert Hilburn, this video has a more powerful effect.  To see June looking John knowing she had been diagnosed with a leaking heart valve.  The look on her face reinforces the belief she had that if she went to have the surgery, she would never return home.  She hurt not facing her death but knowing John would have to face her death.
Sins	It’s not a goodbye, but a see you later friend 🥺

And understand the pain. Take care everyone. Keep chins up. Jesus suffered beatings , spit on, kicked for us and died . He felt humans 
Were important enough to die for. Our precious Jesus Christ and his Father Jehovah will bring earth back to its original purpose. Rev 21:4 God will wipe away tears and death will be no more .For the former things have passed away ..Even the lords prayer speaks of God’s will taking place on earth as it already has in heaven. ......."

Victor Nicolau	"LYRIC

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away
In the end



And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away
In the end


And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Mister Isekai	Honestly, this song has been in my reccomended feed for a while and before clicking it and even as I started watching: I thought this was made either this year or a couple years ago. I had no clue this was a remastered video from 2002 because the detail and lighting in the video is so incredible. And that's not even talking about how powerful and sad the emotions in the song are and the fact he died 6 months after this was made.

Arcanis Twelve12	Not sure if this has been said. But Trent Reznor is adamantly against other artists covering his music. But when Johnny reached out for this song, Reznor seeked out and told The Man in Black that he would be honored to hear him sing it. And was flattered that a true legend admired his songwriting.

iowacowboy o	I'm not scared of death I'm scared of the unone
Tokahontas	I understand his pain now.. it’s regret. Everything he’s done and said to his wife, everything he’s said to his mom. The things he’s done for money, living in the money and not thinking about life, watching friends die as life fly’s by from drugs. Burning bridges, making fake friends. Being selfish. Regret

Kim Barnett	I am so glad he did this song.NINs was one of my sons favorites,so when he came and wanted me to hear the remake we listened to it together. When Jimmy,my son died this song began to mean so much more to me. Sometimes I feel I need to hurt myself to see if I still feel and then I think of the great 27 years I had with him and I keep myself and find a way without him but always in my soul and heart☮️💜

Muffin 007	Who the fuck were the 10k that have disliked this?
Matthew Ellett	It's such a great and deep song. The rasp of his voice, the pain. The pressure he's putting his guitar under to hear the fret buzz is exactly how we all feel. Society puts this pressure on us and eventually, we speak out. If society doesn't like it we are deemed crazy or mental. Maybe we are the sane ones? Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows? None of us, and that's what life is. Almost 8 billion people with the illusion of control when really we are all clueless to everything
Alec	i’m into rap and stuff but sore this pop up and listend to it and it’s acually really good!!

Infrared Toa	"I am a writer. I have two friends of mine that also dedicate to the same thing, and they do an amazing job with their work. Said job that I became very invested emotionally on. Naturally, when there were dark moments, I felt like shit, but one of my friends pushed the darkness to a level I couldn't even take it anymore. I had to stop reading their stuff to save them from my possible awful behavior.

Rain, W4D3, I had to do this. You might see a dark side that you will be disgusted to see. I don't want to hurt you two.

I'm sorry."

Ernani Neto	"I remenber when i had a cronic depression back in january 2012. Its weird because this song was one of the best, if not the best song, i was always listen to.

Julian Bateman	"I love this version, bossman is black absolutely makes it his, kinda hard to watch at times. Always found it amazing that he chose it as his last...as Kieth said ""I wrote the song but Johnny was meant to sing it"" ...maybe not direct quote...it took months to convince bossman to do it...bloody glad he did!!  12/10 rubber chickens all day 😚"
BorgManTV	i thought this was oliver tree's video for a sec
Julie Hunt	"i respect and admire such an artist. There were no words Johnny Cash has ever sung that didnt speak truth to me, at one point of my life. Nothing but love for such a Jesus fearing Man.
If ya'll can find the time to also look up ""On a Sunday Morning Sidewalk' written by the Great Chris Christopherson (spelling?) preferably preformed by a very young Mr. Cash. And Also 'I'm Going down to Jackson' not sure if that is the right name, he sings with June, who in my humble opinion, was Also One Of A Kind. These are a couple songs that have spoken to me.
Hope You like :)"

Neon_Radd_Catcher	"After listening to this sad song, it reminds me of LOGAN, the way how Wolverine died and that Hugh Jackman will no longer play Wolverine.

Công Lê	"Lyrics:
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"
LIL Rolo	RIP Johnny Cash always the best 😢🥺
Markus 786	Johnny Cash never fade away, he lives in his songs for eternity
soolly 357	It always gets to me knowing that he died a year after the song came out... Kinda fitting yet very powerful
thomas williamson	For people who say this song’s depressing, music maximises current moods. This song will make your sadness sad. But I see it as a beautifully poetic masterpiece. Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light
Michael Germer	"It seems to me that this is a confession for those that have the ""eyes"" to see it. He saw a kindred spirit in Trent Reznor. Maybe similar awareness of the world and based on that, chose to use his words as his expression of his confession."
Cido Lago	Eu tento imaginar a noite em que os discos de ouro foram quebrados. Como faz pra solidão passar? Como faço pra minha vida acabar?
Reid Kyrzyk	I like the part with the guitar
Gwenns Place.	"Now look. I know almost everything there is about Johnny Cash. Including his drug abuse and drug violations. But I feel all of this. 16 years of life. And now I do drugs. I can't let go. I don't know how to move on. I don't live in my own house anymore. I wanna start again a million miles away so that I could keep myself. ""Just because I take a 100 ml of antidepressants, doesn't mean all my problems are solved mom. Remember you're the one who got me addicted to all these happy pills. You can't just sugar coat everything you tell me! And you don't get that I hurt. That my body aches with physical and emotional pain from so many years of being beat down, and not being built back up. I will let you down and I will make you hurt"" when really, I just make myself hurt."
runawayfortoday	Hmmm.  Was looking up old Johnny Cash songs and after a few watched this.  Very powerful.  Man wrote his own requiem...  A damned good one.
Red Devil	You can hear the pain in his voice and it shakes me to my core.
Pat	I think you feel the pain in his heart of his loss of June and I think a little  with his brother  in this song in my opinion ....... I wish I had a best friend like Johnny had in June ..... Been searching all my life for my best friend ..... Love ya Jonny and June
WVcricker	Everyone I know goes away in the end...  remembering my 22 yr old son who passed 5 yrs ago..   I love you, my sweet baby...  forever

Konradas Jokubaitis	I was never afraid of death but i cant mentaly accept to kill myself
Ognjen Milicevic	damn this hurts....
Jo-e-z Infuso	One of the best lyrics, ever
David Schwab	My greatest fear about death isn't that I'll be separated from the world, or my body, or my personality. It's that I might be separated from everyone I know, even all the strangers I might have known, and be left with nothing. That some part of me might linger on but with nothing else at all.
The Golden Cross	He didn't live the best life, but he died as a legend to remember
Mark Hallworth	Definitely one of the best songs ever written, I know it's a cover but Johnny Cash made this song his own.
Don Chaos / LOUP	Being the last in a row.........is the fight for a fullfilled life......if you start fighting, u already have lost......take it and make every day your's....

PeleisLegend	Shit, this song is quite eerie because he ended up losing June around 6-7 months before he died. Obviously he released his last album around a year before that but man.

Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"
Pug Zero	"I'm not afraid of dying

I'm afraid of what comes after."
Jakey Boy	Wether you have an empire of dirt or an empire of gold just enjoy your life and appreciate the people around you freinds, family, girlfriends/boyfriends, teachers and employers just live your best life
Ninjamage	I will always cry watching this video. It’s just so raw and emotional
Christopher Oehlers	So what hes saying is if I destroy the whole world I wont have to watch amyone I care about die before me because well all die together... Ah
Savage Man	So can relate
Евгений Виленский	Great man and singer by his heart...
Strahinja	When legend gets old like every other human and looks back at his life...just chilling
Paul Stewart	I have no one, no life, no job now thanks to Covid, no money, about to be thrown out of my rented place, no money from Universal Credit, no food and very little electric left, there's no one to talk to no one to love, no one to feel wanted by. I literally have nothing left, I'm 48 and worked all my life, I've lost everything and everyone
wilhelmrk	I came here because a fat guy played the instrumental and disappointed me by not singing the rest of the text.
Stuart McLean	I feel him. I am looking for a way and this final preformance..... it's ... so deep. p[lease dont troll it anyone... it is so honest.... it's, the life of men ........
ALRIGHT die Band TV	Good Song 👍💖👋
Karl-Wilhelm Schmidt	"590 Billion Aufrufe! Die Liebe erträgt alles, 
sie glaubt alles, sie hofft alles, sie duldet alles.

Streitet nicht um Worte, was zu nichts nütze ist, als die zu verwirren, die zuhören. Der Friede Gottes, der höher ist als alle Vernunft, 
bewahre eure Herzen und Sinne in Christus Jesus.
Wie die Leiden Christi reichlich über uns kommen, 
so werden wir auch reichlich getröstet werden von Gott.
Die Liebe erträgt alles, sie glaubt alles, sie hofft alles, sie duldet alles.
Glauben, Hoffnung, Liebe, diese drei; aber die Liebe ist die größte unter ihnen.
Und wenn ich prophetisch reden könnte und wüsste alle Geheimnisse und alle 
Erkenntnis und hätte allen Glauben, so dass ich Berge versetzen könnte und hätte die Liebe nicht, so wäre ich nichts.

 
Der Bürger wird nicht gefragt! Es geht nur noch darum, 
die Stadt- BRV mit Wohn - und Geschäftshäusern zu verdichten!

In den vergangenen Wochen hatten Bürger immer wieder den freien 
Blick auf die Häuserzeile in der Kirchenstraße gelobt und den Wunsch 
geäußert, der Platz sollte unbebaut bleiben!
„BRV. Jetzt ist sie da, die lang ersehnte Genehmigung für den Bau des neuen Wohn – und Geschäftshaus auf dem Bremervörder Rathausmarkt. Investor
des 12,5-Millionen-Euro-Projektes, das von der Planungsgesellschaft Nord
Entwickelt wurde, ist die Bremer Specht Gruppe.“



49,28 Billion Aufrufe! Grundrente für jeden Bürger in Deutschland!

Grundrente, wie in Holland; wo jeder (Holländer) 1100,00 Euro Grundrente bekommt. In Österreich: Rentner in der Alpenrepublik bekommen auch Weihnachts- und Urlaubsgeld, und in Deutschland gibt es noch nicht einmal eine Grundrente, wie in Holland. Solidaritätsbeitrag von der Mehrwertsteuer für die Grundrente in Deutschland! Unabhängig davon ob man je gearbeitet hat. „Ich bin Holländerin Karin Keiser“. Man muss 50 Jahre holländerischer Staatsangehöriger gewesen sein und 50 Jahre in den Niederlanden ansässig um die Grundrente vom Staat zu bekommen. Unabhängig davon ob man je gearbeitet hat. Das spielt keine Rolle“.  Damit die Menschen sich nicht über andere Menschen erhöhen, da wir ja vor dem Gesetzt alle gleich sind, müssen wir einen Weg finden wie man die Grundrente Finanziert. Solidaritätsbeitrag von der Mehrwertsteuer für die Grundrente in Deutschland. 



Lew Kopelew sagte: Journalisten
sollten Zivilcourage zeigen, denn Sprache ist eine subtile Waffe.

Wenn man die Menschenrechte ernst nimmt, darf man sich selbst nicht als das Maß aller Dinge begreifen. Deutsche wollen engere Partnerschaft, 81 Prozent der Deutschen plädieren für engere Beziehungen zu Russland.Die Krim ist ureigenes russisches Land; die Halbinsel ist für Russland militärisch und geostrategisch sehr wichtig. Die Ukraine wurde nicht mit offenen Armen im Westen aufgenommen. Seit dem Zerfall der Sowjetunion sind alle Hoffnungen in der Ukraine auf eine verlässliche Politik zerstört worden. 1954 hat Nikita Chruschtschow die Ukraine an der Sowjetrepublik verschenkt; 300 Jahre war die Ukraine unter russische Reich.


Algorithmen auf Aktien!

Selbständig lernende Systeme und intelligente Software revolutionieren nicht nur das Wirtschaftsleben nachhaltig. Auch an der Börse spielt dieses Thema eine immer wichtigere Rolle, erklärt Mikko Ripatti, Senior Client Portfolio Manager bei DNB Asset Management. Das Thema Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ist dabei, ein Megatrend zu werden. Die Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Beratungsgesellschaft PWC beziffert das Wachstumspotenzial bis zum Jahr 2030 auf 15,7 Billionen Dollar. Das entspricht einem Anstieg des Welt-BIP von 14 Prozent. Künstliche Intelligenz: Algorithmen für den Aktienmarkt?




Elektroautos müssen vom Staat gefördert werden! 

Der Klimawandel ist schon da; kauft Elektroautos. Beim Zahnarzt muß man immer zubezahlen, armes Deutschland; es ist wie mit der Grundrente, in anderen Ländern zB. Holland gibt es eine Grundrente von 1100,00€. Elektroautos: Tesla hat die Elektroautos angeschoben, auch andere Autohersteller teils zwangsläufig zum mitmachen gezwungen.
Man soll nicht glauben, weil es wieder kälter wird, das die Erderwärmung nicht kommt. Die Gletscher schmelzen, dadurch wird es erst kälter, dann aber kommt die wärme, und viele Menschen kommen nach Europa. Tut was gegen die Erderwärmung, fliegen trägt nicht gerade zum Klimaschutz bei! Der Klimawandel ist schon da, aber ein Kreuzfahrtriese (Meyer Werft Papenburg) wird mit konventionellem Treibstoff  betrieben? Ende Oktober steht die Übergabe des Schiffes in Bremerhaven an die Reederei Norwegian Cruise Lines an! Kinder an die Macht! Wo sind die Proteste! 



Tattoos ist keine Kunst, es ist ein armer Tropf!

Mainstream. „Hauptströmung“ spiegelt den kulturellen Geschmack einer großen Mehrheit wieder, den Massengeschmack. 
Jeder hat das Recht, seine Meinung in Wort, Schrift und Bild frei zu äußern!
Tattoos ist keine Kunst, es ist ein armer Tropf mag sich mit Tattoos plagen, ist doch nur Kunstversagen! Die schönsten Frauen sind durch Tattoos hässlich gemacht wurden, was macht der Staat? Einst waren Tattoos etwas für Individualisten. Tattoos sind hässlich, unterschichtig und selbstverstümmelnd!

Somehow, I know He is with God, like the thief on the cross. This is the note he chose to leave on. He preached the Gospel.
LITTLEMEN	Uma das únicas músicas que já me fizeram chorar...

Soul Truth	It’s about reflection , looking back over ones life , the good and the bad , the emptiness of knowing the time has passed before your eyes along with the people you loved and you remain alone and accepting what you were , where you have been and what’s left behind.. and lastly whats left presently without all you once had ... this heart of his vocals to cover This song and the meaning behind the closed venue, going back through the past to take stock it it’s chapters  and empty cases in his home represent all of the end of life thoughts.. sometimes it’s more painful to remember what was in comparison To what remains at the end of their life ... it’s all part of our journey, you flashback through your life until it’s over , it’s the process ...Rest In Peace
Qanea Mahmoudi	4k! Finally in good quality
Escravos da Urbe	Racist?
billcreek1234	I love and miss you babe.
Spen Doggy Dog	Spen doggy Dog is immortal, the fact that you mortals even feel upset about the fact one day you and everyone you love will be dead forever is a joke too me. Whilst I am able to post IMO videos on why the Wembley Cup is no longer continued makes you look little compared to me. I’m Spen Doggy Dog and I do what I want

1951_Vintage_Oldsoul	"*And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down, I will make you hurt.*

Trent Reznor did great writing this song but Cash just did it better imo. Reznor was born to write it, Cash was born to perform it. It is more sad knowing how Cash did it because you can tell he knew his time was near and he was repenting to Jesus Christ.  He's in Heaven now.

xiahouduin	"I am honestly scared of:
Dying
Everyone else dying
Nothingness and life after death both
Regretting my life on my deathbed
Suffering on my deathbed
Not achieving anything in my life
Wasting my life and chances
Wasting (wasted?) the best time of my life
Not to have anyone by my side for the rest of my life
Being left behind by the people who are close to me

Changes from time to time, but always circles around those."

A Fez	I dont know why but every fucking time this song makes me cry like a child  . Its such a well done send off  for both Johny and June . True Love
Maynard Blaston	Best part of the history of this song has to be when Trent Reznor (NiN) heard Mr. Cash's version for the first time.
benj1b	"Dust in the wind....
Our life is a vapor.
For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul"

A Question I ask myself daily. 
Everything I repressed finally caught up to me, 
and looking in the mirror was to look at a very familiar stranger.
The one person I could never seem to lose.

Very powerful song, with a very powerful Voice to tell the tale."

TheSolitaryOne	He was actually very handsome in his younger years. Especially at 1:44

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
I would find a way"

BlackMamba24	This song is so powerful! The type of song you listen to and think about everything you've been through in your life. I've lost 4 close individuals to me in just 2020 and honestly I'm mentally fucked up. No matter what I do I can't get over it😢 and it sucks because I work most of the time so I don't really have time for friends and I don't have anyone to open up to.

Trippy McHippy	I don't fear death.  Problem is, the next day, you're so stiff.
seraphic	Props to Trent Reznor for writing this, but this is Johnny Cash's song. Reznor was always writing it for him -- he just didn't know it until Cash covered it. This song is Cash's final word on his entire life, the way Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien was Edith Piaf's, and Lazarus was David Bowie's. 2:53 hurts to see. His aging tremor contrasted against grainy memories of his younger self, vigorous and carefree.
Ryan Optekar	"If 2020 was a song, this would be it

Leo W	I was saying to a friend that while this is kind of a meme song, I still love it and find it absolutely beautiful. My friend pointed out that as a song, it does hit a bit differently when it's coming from an old man who's probably seen a lot of people die.

Bossnium	I've never heard this song before and I love Johnny and YouTube insisted I listened, I shredded a tear to see him in that shape. RIP THE GREAT JOHNNY CASH
Kathy Brevold	So true
RiotGirrrL wise	I really do love this video. I STILL prefer Trent Reznor's version ( NIN), after all, it's HIS baby & came from HIS soul & dedicated it as a Valentine for all of HIS fans that are broken or struggle with self loathing & such. I may be biased due to that and the fact that it has & always will represent a stillness and a deep self inquiry regarding my generation & seeing them live in the early 90's, having 'Hurt' always be the Last song played at a NIN show....it's just personal to me. HOWEVER,  HAVING SAID THAT......I am STILL DEEPLY  & EMOTIONALLY moved by this video & Johnny's rendition and ability to show such vulnerability,  knowing that his chapter ( & his wife's, whom passed away mere months after the release) is coming to an end, and stepping back to look at all he's accomplished and left behind. A wonderful representation of TIME ITSELF!!! Though I will ALWAYS consider it Trent's song, Jonny mastered making it even a bit his own!! Bravo Johnny!!! Rest your weary bones in peace ya beautiful man!!

Goes away in the end

Don't we all think that at some point in our lives?"
Tim Scott	If this song doesn’t play at my funeral.......I won’t be going
RockSolidWood	He recorded this within a very short time before passing. It was his gift, expression and thought to everyone else that you don't know what good you have, until its all gone. It was supposed he didn't think he ought to have made it so far in the end, and that he thought he use others as a legup to get where he wanted, then mistreated his power. You did yourself right, Johnny. You did your name justice.

bug on tv(B.O.T) SoberFly [ Shawn Melenka]	sad but true! we dont die, we just get in to where we fit in. this world will live sneaky yet jesus has no error to his judgement on us! and he has an authority of spiritual community that can make sense of all the nonsense we endure! and that authority can sift threw all forms of religion or non religion. because they were probably a bit more serious then our generations can embrace.😭

Chedda Cheez	It’s sad that all of his mistakes and bad actions in his past hit him all ago once when his life was almost over. This song has so much meaning behind it.

Jesus Solis	Never know where
Vincent	definition of Depression .
Eucalyptus	His life is coming to the end. Love is the only thing you can take with you.  What you have in possessions that you thought was needed to become someone means nothing. His love for his wife can break a man when she dies.  You come into the world alone and you leave it alone, with love.
Aiman Daniel	shivers.
Nathália Alves	Não é apenas uma musica é uma baita lição de moral, hoje em dia falta musicas assim.

Gilberto Carballo	The lyrics of this magnificent piece can be interpreted of different ways. But it's true that his expression adds something else. We should start to give more importance to our family and friends, appearing in their life and support them. This pandemic has come to teach us about how much we should appreciate the time.

Erdfgdv Refdvewdghebs	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

Alvodisco	I still can't watch this without crying
Squirley Spitmonkey	Man, he really turned this song into a sad testament of aging, didn't he?

AG C	I wear this crown Of thorns upon my liar's chair.  Meaning he thought he was always the holy one and everyone else was bad when in fact he was lying to himself and everyone else. It's a shame it took the man his whole life to realize  That he in fact was the one in control of his life ... millions of people will live this same life.

JM	I've grown to hate this song.  It's weak and pathetic.  Fight me.
Gyxo	"Cash died five months after his wife.
Heart-wrenching."

Charles Harris	A salute to greatness.
Brendan	No matter how many times I see this video the way he closes his piano will always send a shiver down my spine.
Maxwell Gallardo	Logan it’s time
Gabriel Aderre	This song and video reminds me of my biological grandfather.  He has so much wealth, and many beautiful things.  But he has gotten it all by sacrificing his relationships with his family.  He sits in a big fine house, surrounded by top quality antiques, and a full bank account. And really, he has nothing, and I feel sorry for him..
Paulo Matheus	Wonderful
Nacho	"""And you could have it all My empire of dirt"" .... i dont know why this phrase everytime hit me hard"

Wal Lima	Perfeita !
Bob Hess	This is music video pretty much as good as it gets. It brings the song, the artist, the music, and the meaning together. And we are left drained by the end of it. I must have seen this video fifty times. I ALWAYS weep.
chris hutchinson	Absolute perfection!!!
Alessandro Caneschi	In a song all story of a men... Great song

zaza tavartkiladze	its easy to die but to living for someone or something who is importent for u is harder... so dont promise others that u will be always there when u never know what will happen to u...

Alex A	"я ранил сам себя
понять я лишь хотел
совсем ли я забыл
что чувствовать умел"
Jory Granados	When I first figured out this was a cover song, I didn't want to believe it. Someone with a legendary voice like Johnny Cash? But it makes sense, if you listen to the original Nine Inch Nails song, or watch that documentary about how he came to writing his own cover of the song. On the one hand, a boy or teenager crying out to the world, begging for relief from a life that he feels is his fault when in reality it's just not fair. Then you listen to Johnny, and it's just regret. Soft-spoken, deep, reflective. He knows his life wasn't perfect, he knows he could have done better, and there's nothing he can do but apologize. That hits me really hard, and I can't help but wonder if this won't be what I'm doing when or if I reach his age when he wrote this song. Will I be begging for forgiveness on my death bed? Trying to make restitution for things I can't change? What will be my legacy to my family and my children? Will I even have one?
Frankie 🐯 Felines Always Welcome	I remember seeing Johnny in the odd movie or weekly drama on TV. He was a fabulous actor as well as a great singer.
Capta1nHux	perfect. Favourite song to play on the guitar.
David Shell	when you beg for forgiveness nothing happens

Petey N.Y.	Wow Very Very Powerful! 💔
Mags Monroe	I cannot speak for the needle. Whoever the words of this song feel true to who I’ve ended up being. Depression is a motherfucker, no one seems to respect it. But everyone else is a science and their friends is to reach out because you never know when I’m going to end it don’t ever give up on a loved one / friend. Even if your only trying to call once a month... don’t stop.

Dave Kupchik	This song and video reminds me of my Dad, he just looked and sounded like Johnny.
Joydeep Aich	The same song listened by the same person but at different times gives different interpretations. Sense of love, achievement, wealth, regret, sadness, inevitable death, and finally an old person who has seen it all is ready to trade his ALL to start afresh.
TheMr.Wichis	Vine por woshingo
Shadic MR	I cry to see how the years go by and at last death comes that anyone makes cry

Dagmar Knieriem	supper lied danke
Alberto valverde	Wow.
TooOld ForTwoWheels	One of the few covers of a song that are better than the original. This as a big NIN fan and not particularly a Cash fan. The gravitas conveyed by this version is so emotive, it hits you like the proverbial ton of bricks. The way this version has such a bitter-sweet crescendo is absolute brilliance.
Seamus Moore	Legend's don't die they live forever
Clear. Touji	This is just a copy of nine inch needles hurt seriously why do people think he wrote it there's an 11 year difference

Fallen Angel	Wow. I’d heard this song before, but didn’t know who it was at the time. Then my sis sent me an amazing Red Dead Redemption II  fan-made trailer with this song and told me who it was. (We’re both playing RD at the moment and the song fits perfectly for Arthur) This is a bloody heartbreaking song and video. You can see and hear a man who knows he hasn’t got long. A beautiful, tragic and haunting song.

CHRWEA3	"Lyrics:
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"
DayCon	Johnny is the only man who would make me rethink life, I’m 47 years old and the first time I met the man was in Nashville, I was 14 and I was a little a-hole but when I shook hands and exchanged a few words with John, It truly changed my way in life and I thank him for that, I thank the people who made him famous when he started and if he wasn’t famous I would be selling Crack Cocaine on the street. Thank ya, THE MAN IN BLACK!  Mr.Johnny cash.
Luis Ramirez	To think he listened to Nine Inch Nails is epic on itself
Entr3 Nou5	"This song and the original song are both great, but convey different types of pain.

The NIN version feels like pure emptiness. A feeling of not feeling at all. Pure desperation to experience something, anything.

The Johnny Cash version is the opposite, being so full of emotion and pain. The tone of his voice, the shaking of his hands."
Mark Mcallister	What a song helped me through tough times
Alan Rowe	I met johny cash in 2003 in banff. I was on holiday and saw him getting measured for a new hat. What a kind and honest man. I was the one who walked away from the conversation because I didn't want want to take up too much of his time. He was quite happy conversing and comparing hats. For me I was star struck to see one of my heros. And he said he felt the same way to meet one of his fans. RIP johny... man in black
Peder Bentsen-Øvrebø	This song makes me think of my life and what will become of it, will i do something that will be remebered? or will i just vanish in time.

The Controversial Chicken	"I don't know why, But whenever I listen to this song it reminds me of a family member I lost, I don't even know if he enjoyed This type of music, Cause the only speaking I ever heard him do was just heavy breathing and some random mumbled words, But It still reminds me of him and his horse blanket/poster in the room

He always made sure I was fed whenever I came to visist, He couldn't verbally show how much he cared for me, But I knew he was kind, No matter how many times he said his signature slogan, ""GDU"",  to my other relative, I knew he had a kind soul.

I remember around the time he died, He prayed, Remember my other relative claimed that he said god had spoken to him or that he saw god in a vision, And of course, A few days later, He passed away in a hospital room.

Rest in peace Butch, You will be missed."

Theunis Jansen van Rensburg	"I love this song. The original of course, but Johnny's version more so for one big reason. 

Many see this as wholly solemn and sad song, but with the lyrics and themes depicted here I see one important message: You are extremely lucky to alive, and even though we all have enormous struggles and trepidation, we need to celebrate the fact that we have life with the ones we love before it's gone. 

If you're coming here because you're sad or went through some trauma, please leave here feeling special and loved. Life is good and amazing to all of us, even if we don't feel it right now."

I wish there were more singers like Johnny Cash and didn't have other people write their music so they can make millions of off that one song and so they can use voice changers to make the song sound ""better"".The generation i was born into has singers who acted like they care about the songs they make but have other people write them for them Johnny Cash put effort into his music writing it all himself and thinking hard about what he should say in the song. With this kind of music you get hooked on it for weeks maybe even months too years."

Soli Deogloria	"What is the chief end of man ? 

Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. 


There is a reason why something rather than nothing and it is predicated on the uncaused, non contingent, first cause of all contingency...


God


The Bible says that we must “put on” something, like putting on a parachute before jumping out of a plane. 


That parachute is…


Jesus The Christ 


Galatians 3:26-27
26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ *have put on Christ..* 


And… 


Ephesians 4:24
24 And that *you put on the new man,* which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.


That parachute is desperately needed because we are all on board a plane that will crash. It might be in 85 years or it just might be before you draw your next breath. 


Put on the parachute before you jump into eternity… 


Seek Jesus Christ the Redeemer.

Pin Head Larry	This is the only song that has made me cry. Just listening to it makes you realize nothing really matters in the end. Items are items and mean nothing .

Fabian Bildung	I admire this guy and I am not even an American citizen.
Jawn Hansen	So funny story about this music video: the original concept was for cash to be playing in an empty amphitheater with his personal possessions piled up behind him. Throughout the performance Johnny depp (of all people) was to come in dressed as a stage worker slowly removing the items until it is just Johnny cash on stage. Before THAT video was filmed cash and June both began experiencing severe health problems and June was convinced she was going to die so they made plans to go to Jamaica one last time to their vacation home. Johnny cash gave the video producer one chance in short notice one afternoon before their flight and the production crew walked into his house without a concept, a direction, or plan. What happened is the most raw, painfully truthful music video you see here. In fact, it was so sharp and painful that Johnny’s family and friends urged him not to release it. Also, Johnny cash never saw this video. He was completely blind at this point. It really takes a tremendous amount of bravery and courage to do something like this and I really think what you see here is a man that has come to terms with his own mortality. It is in true Johnny cash spirit to go out like this. Unflinching, and cold to the bone.
zz	The country remaking of this song is better than the original. The song is emo though, and leaves no faith for God, or anything good. By the way, I signed the guitar that he used for this song.

Acid	"*Lyrics:*

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
-
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
-
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
-
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

I Scream Is Cool	I'm sorry, but I firstly listened to the original. This just doesn't do it for me. Not to sound like a hipster or an asshole, but Cash's attempt is just horrendous in my view. And I simply cannot understand how people like this version more then the original.

Energy-centers from lowest to highest, above, for Ones well being in the FORM of Physical and Spiritual.


Each energy-sphere has a certain sound (Frequency = Hz) of music that they vibrate on and when you MAKE THE SAME SOUND IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU ARE HEARING while listening to the sound while meditating or just listening with headphones to get the maximum effect and tuning the sound into your MIND. You can also listen all of the frequencies at the same time, but first listen to them one at the time.
WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. As SPIRIT in a PHYSICAL FORM, is a BEING of FREQUENCY of HARMONIOUS SOUND can make items vibrate with their MIND, by learning the SOUND for their MIND, for benefit of OTHERS and your-SELF by creating the frequency of the Hz above with your MIND and then directing it to an ITEM or another BEING.

When you make STAR TETRAHEDRON and take PURPLE LIGHT FROM THE STAR AND ASK THE STAR OF LIGHT TURN INTO a PURPLE FLAME SYMBOL in THE EMOTIONAL CENTER*HEART ONE GETS RID OF THEIR KARMIC LAW.
STAR TETRAHEDRON being THE ARCHITYPAL SYMBOL which holds THIS UNIVERSE and PARALELL UNIVERSES TOGETHER IN A MULTI-UNIVERSE.
13 which hold the MATRIX together for the SPIRITS in PHYSICAL FORMS. ONE TO CONTROL THE OTHER 12 http://freedomcode.com.au/thoths-12-world-pyramids/
ETHER being the PRIMAL ELEMENT from which THE ALL ELEMENTS are FORMED- LIGHT, SOUND, DARKNESS, FIRE, EARTH, AIR, COSMOS, WATER, LAW, CHAOS, BALANCE, SPIRIT, MIND, TIME, DESTINY, DEATH, EMOTIONS, ENERGY-INFINITY- (NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL GOOD, NEUTRAL BAD, GOOD, BAD), FORM- THE ALL THAT HAS BEEN CREATED, MULTIVERSE-if THEE knows it is so, then YEE are part of the MULTIVERSE.
Thee can take ENERGY from ETHER if Thee has the KNOWING so, NEUTRAL, GOOD, (NEUTRAL GOOD),(NEUTRAL BAD) or BAD.
What can be FORMED FROM PRIMAL ELEMENT
BODY/body's mind and soul, soul mind=astral body's mind=eternal infinite, i one knows and belives, and so it is so. In all dimensions.
To obtain the KNOWLEDGE of the UNIVERSE, ONE must/can activate the KEYS OF SEVEN and learn of the SYMBOLS of THE UNIVERSE. To CREATE inner UNIVERSE OR MULTIVERSE.
Explaination of DEATH> Death is no more than HELPER for the transition of the SPIRIT of who THEE be from one FORM to the NEXT into SPIRIT WORLD, to take your OWN FORM. Every SPIRIT in FORM IS THEIR OWN MASTER OF THEIR FORMS DEATH AS IMMORTAL SPIRITS.
Numerology: meaning adding numbers together by adding them to one diget number (88= 8+8= 17=1+7=8) 8 is base frequency of which 88 vibrates as, as everything and everyone vibrates.

E	"I tink the reason people get sad over this song is because it really makes you realize how minuscule you are. Your life is pointless. Only a few percent end up getting their name known. And if you did get your name known, it wouldn't be worth it. As he says, his empire is dirt. It is worthless. It would let you down. It would make you hurt.

But you shouldn't dwell on this. You do matter. Your empire may not be much but that doesnt matter. You make a difference. If you weren't born the world might explode. You may have effected someone's life who effected someone else's life, who effected someone else's life, and that person became famous, and helped the world. You matter. With and action you effect the world. You matter. You make a difference."

                   non contingent, first 
                   cause of all contingency.

Angie C	Johnny did take it.
J S	Flashes of years gone by with June Carter Cash, Jesus Christ, Elvis, and the Rev. Billy Graham. Johnny Cash was a Christian and had many friends. Read “Man in Black“, his autobiography. It’s really good! He went through some hard times. These men were gold and now they‘ve gone on. Rejoicing in Heaven; what we see is temporary and what is not seen is eternal. God bless!

dakren12	"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way....."
Cold Killer	This is definitely one of the best songs known to man.
Patient Zero	This should be age restricted
Marcus_Allen Siebeneck	This song brings back so much hurt. I have lost so many loved ones and friends. I love this song tho it makes me cry. It's so beautiful that I have picked it for my funeral. Johnny Cashs cover on this song gave it so much more emotion.
