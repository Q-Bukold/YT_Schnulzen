silvia rey	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around

Elias Sancillo	I really wish I had this song my entire life such a unique and well put together masterpiece absolute virtuoso of a song doesn’t get any better then this so raw and simple but so deep and powerful it really makes you have a feeling of acceptance of yourself and let’s you say you are who you are and you accept it and love it WOW is all I can say and let’s not get into his delivery of these lyrics what a god like performance top 3 songs ever and not debatable

Саша Сотник	"I thought that nothing can kick me in and i really like. But i saw Joe Division's ""Ceremony"" by Tom York... And Radiohead became my favourite band. Their creation passed through all my life, i liked art of their first album, when i saw it on the internet, and even if i didn't understand some their songs, it was something unusual for me and took my heart, and it's cool"
Richard Geller	"When I was a teen I started relating to the lyrics but it got me down because I was harsh on myself.... But in the end , the ""I don't belong here"" would make me feel at peace, I just have to accept that this is who I am then, I thought. A few years later and real life experiences, when I hear ""I don't belong here"" I feel wow I was so harsh on myself for nothing, I am my friend and I love myself and tomo I will get better. 
It doesn't make sense because the lyrics don't talk about life, but anyways
Thank you Radiohead♥"

It sounds just as good today as it did back then. Actually, I see how much better music told a story back then than it does now. Maybe it just seems that way because that's when I was younger and more impressionable.

Haru Sae	I've been in love with a girl for a while, I've never really had a positive self-esteem, so even though I even dream about the girl, even after a long time I haven't had the courage to declare myself, it really hurts to live like this, I think I'm nothing  to have chance to be with her, she is so perfect that I don't think I deserve her, and at this point, even though it hurts, I think I'll give up. :) I am a creep.

Mehak Verma	I've been single my whole life. And for the past few years, I would come back and listen, over and over again...But now somebody likes me, and I like them. I think I might be entering my first relationship soon...so this time, when I listened to the song, it felt different, maybe it felt worse. I'm afraid to let him in. To tell him I'm a creep, because I'm afraid he'll run away. He'll know I'm a loser. He has no trouble opening up to me about his problems, but I would never tell him any of mine...

Jacqueline Dinan	Love you from Irish Jackie
Miguel	His acting is so fucking good and natural in this one, he's like angry that he can't have who he wants because he can't possibly be at level, so it becomes a sort of love-hate, he's fighting hard to accept that he can't blame, that there's no way around and has to let go. When he realizes that she runs away he breaks down crying like a baby, then after letting everything out, acceptance gave him peace. Best performance.

SHAKUR	"Lyrics:

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run

Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Michael Quint	My fav song and one of my audition song for artist ❤❤❤
Jen	I just read an article about the history of this song and Radioheads negative feelings about it. I did not know they disliked it , started calling it “ crap” and hardly ever played it.  The clunks in the song are apparently one of the band members trying to “ ruin” it , and it flunked in the UK charts at first but was picked up by an American college station where it started to take off . It was first recorded as the band were playing it as a warm up song  , without their knowledge , which is why is sounds so powerful because it was utterly self conscious. Interesting! Probably my one of my favourite songs ever and OMG are the band deaf? How can they hate this beautiful, melodic, touching , souring , magnificent and timeless song?

Tomorrow you’re a creap, you don’t belong here. Smile because this is the rest of your life in a nutshell. The hurt never goes away, even when you’re old.

Hyung_yeong.wonchi.	"Siendo honesto soy un chico que perdió su camino y orientación desesperado en buscar una respuesta que no logro conseguir, desde muy pequeño tengo problemas para expresarme, a veces me daba envidia al ver cómo los demás niños, los chicos podían expresar ""tristeza, dolor, alegria, desagrado, ira etc"" me frustraba por que yo no puedo hacer eso siempre me costo decir lo que siento oh pienso y es algo que aun me duele ya que no lo he conseguido, lo más triste de todo es que desde muy pequeño empeze a depender de la música no solo para expresarme si no emocionalmente todo dependió de ello si estaba triste la música era quien me escuchaba oh si estaba alegre oh enojado todo y lo único que me escucho fue la música y nada más, son muchas veces que he soltado lágrimas y cuando lo hago me sorprendo por que ni yo mismo puedo comprender lo que siento y cuando me enamore por primera vez me dolió tanto por que es para mi difícil expresarme y siento que no merezco Amor y tampoco ser amado por que puedo llegar a lastimar a personas que no quiero lastimar."

Você é como um anjo

Sua pele me faz chorar

Você flutua como pluma

Num mundo perfeito

Eu queria ser especial

Você é especial pra caralho



Mas eu sou uma aberração, um esquisito

Que diabos é que eu estou fazendo aqui

Este não é meu lugar



Não me importa se vai doer

Quero ter o controle (da situação)

Quero um corpo perfeito

Uma alma perfeita

Quero que você perceba

Quando eu não estou por perto

Você é especial pra caralho

Eu queria ser especial



Mas eu sou uma aberração, um esquisito

Que diabos é que eu estou fazendo aqui

Este não é meu lugar



Ela está indo embora de novo

Esta fugindo

Ela foge, foge, foge, foge, foge



O que você quiser para te fazer feliz

O que você quiser

Você é especial pra caralho

Eu queria ser especial



Mas eu sou uma aberração, um esquisito

Que diabos é que eu estou fazendo aqui

Este não é meu lugar

Este não é meu lugar"

301rs	I can’t say this is my favorite song and to be honest, I was only subliminally aware of it when it was first released. But, it took a cover I heard of this song yesterday, to realize that this is a great “F”ing song! I am only sad that it took me so long to come to this conclusion.  I seriously underestimated Radiohead.

Novu	Thom Yorke: I was going door-to-door telling people that “Creep” is a bad song when I found myself in a computer store. So I’m sort of sizing up the place, and all of a sudden I get this thought: What if a computer could go drive a car? Then I laughed, ’cause I got the picture of a computer drinking a pint and hanging out with his computer mates. Then all of a sudden I stopped laughing, because I got the idea of what if a computer could play guitar. I was transfixed by this idea. And that’s when I knew: We needed to do an album about that.

You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry. You float like a feather, in a beautiful world - He sees that the rest of the people belong to this world and carry out their roles and life so gracefully and know how to act like a human.

I wish I was special, you're so fucking special. - He thinks others are so special that they play out their roles in life so naturally and belong to the society whereas he feels like a weird person who's not wired for this life and doesn't know how to act. He doesn't what he's doing here in this life. He wishes he had control over this and is ready to give away anything to belong, have this perfect body/soul for this life. His soul feel unnatural in this environment called life and he's trying to express that."

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run

Whatever makes you happy

Atide Skvo	"Radiohead - Creep

When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye,
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry;

You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world,
I wish I was special,
You're so fuckin' special;

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here;

I don't care if it hurts,
I wanna have control,
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul;

I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
You're so fuckin' special,
I wish I was special;

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here, ohhhh, ohhhh

She's running out again,
She's running,
She runs runs runs runs...
Runs...

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special;

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here,

I don't belong here"

Creep

When you were here before 之前當你在這兒
Couldn't look you in the eye 我不能看你的眼睛
You're just like an angel 你就像個天使
Your skin makes me cry 你的肌膚讓我哭
You float like a feather 你飄浮著像根羽毛
In a beautiful world 在ㄧ個美麗的世界
I wish I was special 我希望我是特別的
You're so very special 你真的非常特別
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. 但我是個討厭鬼 我是個怪胎
What the hell am I doing here? 我到底在這兒幹麻
I don't belong here. 我不屬於這裡

I don't care if it hurts 我不在乎如果這會受傷
I want to have control 我想要有所控制
I want a perfect body 我想要完美的身體
I want a perfect soul 我想要完美的靈魂
I want you to notice 我希望你注意
When I'm not around 當我不在附近時
You're so very special 你真的非常特別
I wish I was special 我希望我是特別的

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. 但我是個討厭鬼 我是個怪胎
What the hell am I doing here? 我到底在這兒做什麼
I don't belong here. 我不屬於這裡

She's running out again, 她又消失了
She's running out 她消失了
She's run run run run out... 她消失了

Whatever makes you happy 不管是什麼讓你快樂
Whatever you want 不管你想要什麼
You're so very special 你真的非常特別
I wish I was special... 我希望我是特別的

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, 但我是個討厭鬼 我是個怪胎
What the hell am i doing here? 我到底在這兒幹麻
I don't belong here. I don't belong here...我不屬於這裡 我不屬於這裡..."

Angel G	"EH, TÚ! Sí, tú, sentado detrás de tu pantalla leyendo esto. No te conozco y ciertamente no me conoces a mí. Pero quiero decirte algo. Todos tienen su propia historia. La tuya puede estar llena de alegría y felicidad, o puede estar nublada por el dolor y la desgracia. Quiero que sepas que eres una persona hermosa, maravillosa y talentosa. Incluso si tu vida no va como quieres en este momento, sé que podrás salir bien. Quiero que me hagas un favor. Sé que solo soy un extraño, pero confía en mí, ¿de acuerdo? Cada vez que veas tu reflejo, ya sea en el espejo del baño, en una ventana en algún lugar o en un charco en la calle, quiero que te mires y te des un abrazo. Porque aunque no seas la más guapa, ni la más inteligente ni la más divertida, eres algo que nadie más puede ser: tú. Y eres lo mejor que puedes ser. Sonríe a los extraños. Ten confianza en ti mismo. Llora cuando tengas ganas de llorar, ríe cuando tengas ganas de reír. Trátese como un dios / diosa porque se lo merece. Mantén la cabeza erguida y el corazón abierto. Lo vales todo y algo más. Y recuerda siempre que pase lo que pase, aunque no lo parezca, eres todo para alguien

iuhiuhhui	I have been inlove with this song since the second I was born, everyday I think of this song, this song is my bloodline, this song is my everything. This song has determined my entire life, it has showed my future, I listen to this song hours on end as it unravels my future gradually. This song is the reason I exist, everyday I think of this song, this song is my oxygen, this song is my daily dose of medication, without this song I would have been drop dead, I cannot go without this song, if I do I will disappear into a fragment of Earth. Every lyrics reaches into my heart like I had just been shot by a bullet, this song speaks the truth of me, it really showed me my reason of existence, this song has been injected within me even before my birth, even when I was in the womb this song played endlessly in my head. This song discovered me before I could discover myself, I live for this song, I will live past this song, I will conquer this song with my envy, my jealousy. Nobody matter to me no longer, only this song, this song is the only thing I go on for in life, I will show this world that this is my song. This song was made for me nobody else, only me. This song wouldn't have existed if it never knew about my arrival into this planet, and if I were to never exist this song would have no reason to be created, it would have been tossed in the trash, rejected by every company that was produced onto this Earth. This song maintains so many secrets that one couldn't comprehend, this song knows eternity, it has experienced eternity. This piece of music took my hand and showed me, and took me into an abyss to show me every single glance of a moment in my life, it taught me a lesson I will never forget. This song is the government of life, one that has been hidden ever since it's birth, it slowly reveals itself from the dark shadows, the dark depths of this world, this song created life, this song is the source of life, this song is our god, the only one, the only object that we sha'll ever praise. This song is life.

En ingles (original ) 
when i look into your eyes 
i can only think
 everything we went through
 Do you ever care?
 I descend like a feather 
Why do my eyes look? 
When you only care about her 
Was I ever special?
 No, I was never special
 but i'm a jerk
 i'm such an idiot 
But say what was I doing in the middle? I can't believe you anymore

Ppr si no saben ingles aquí esta la español 

Cuando te veo a los ojos
Solo puedo pensar
Todo lo que pasamos 
Alguna vez te importe?
Desciendo como una pluma
¿Por q mis ojos as de mirar?
Cuando solo te importo ella
¿Acaso alguna vez fui especial ?
No, nunca fui especial 
Pero soy un imbécil
Soy tan idiota
Pero dine q hacia yo en el medio ?
Ya no podre creerte"

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run

udii_the_k_fan	This song is one of my favourites. Today something really happened to me involving this song which I will never forget. So, I started to stan this new kpop group called 'SUPERKIND' and I got a chance to chat with one of the members in that boy group. I asked him to cover this song. I really didn't expect him to cover it, but I was surprised when he covered a part of the song with his guitar 🎸 and vocals within 5 minutes requesting it. He knew the cords, the lyrics all. I was crying while listening to the cover coz he knew the song and fulfilled my request by heart. Also, eventhough it was done as a small request he did cover it really well. It was amazing to know that it is not only me who has this music taste. I was fascinated and I felt so happy. It is amazing how music connects people.💗

Jazz	Hace muy poco, regresé a mi ciudad para cuidar a mi gatita, me había ido por la universidad, y la dejé porque no tenía como llevarla y además, tenía que quedarse para terminar un tratamiento, cuando me enteré que estaba mal, inmediatamente hice los planes para volver, y eso hice. Llegué ayer, y le di todos los cuidados posibles, ella era muy engreída mía, y fue demasiado bonito que, a pesar de su estado, haya hecho el esfuerzo de acercarse a mí y amasar mi cabello, como lo hacía todas las noches cuando estaba aquí.. hoy la llevamos al veterinario, pero fue demasiado estrés para ella, y sufrió un paro cardíaco.. la veterinaria hizo lo que pudo, pero no fue suficiente, me sentí completamente destrozada, aún me siento así, además, recientemente terminé con mi ex pareja, y cuando regresé a casa fue demasiado duro, porque este cuarto, era el lugar donde pasé horas hablando con él, escuchándolo y haciendo diferentes actividades, a diario, y en cada momento del día, estaba mi gatita haciéndome compañía, y ahora que ya no están, este lugar se siente extraño, supongo que también por el hecho de que me mudé, pero vaya, he estado aquí por años, pero jamás me sentí de esta forma por el lugar el que creía era mi lugar seguro, me es muy difícil estar aquí, cada parte de esta habitación, está lleno de recuerdos con mi querida gatita, y me duele demasiado, siento que jamás debí haberme ido y haber cuidado yo de ella, estoy segura de que en este momento ya habría estado recuperada.. Y siento tanta impotencia porque ya no puedo volver al pasado y cambiar mi decisión, siento que tomé el camino incorrecto, y siento que no valía la pena irme y dejar que esto ocurriera, me es complicado quitarme estos pensamientos de la cabeza, pero bueno, no tengo más opción que aguantar y arreglármelas por mi propia cuenta, y en fin, tan sólo quería escribir esto para desahogarme.

e si sono aperte,
e mi han chiesto di entrare,
e mi han chiesto di sedere.
Allora la Tua Voce è esplosa,

mi ha preso le Ali,
mi ha strappato da quella terra arsa...
e sono tornato.
Mi sono risvegliato.
Salvo,
tra le Tue braccia."

jcloud91	Freaking awesome song.
Кирилл Костров	какой крутой рокер
MothWings	This is one of my favorite songs it's so clear and relatable to me. The older I get the more I feel with the lyrics and the pain that there is inside of us at times and how we feel like giving up but it's music like this that make us feel like we're not entirely alone.
Kinte Rashayah	"White boys that jams and rocks hard with flavor is always eerily creepy (no pun intended) as I look on when they perform live or video. 
But I, and many other Brothas will be there to give it Body Rhythm when we rock to it. Lord knows they be lacking in that department. The guitarist with the break... Yes! ""the raven haired reminiscent of a 1960s British Invasion music genre rock musician"" ...That Muthafuckah Gave Flava & Body Rhythm at the same GotDam time. 👍👍 No my friends! all that jumping, head gyrating and skate boarding around on foot with no skateboard isn't body rhythm. 🤭 Even Tommy Morello didn't have body rhythm."

Cristhofer Mera	It is a very beautiful music full of a lot of feeling I love it
Dreaming Life	Nitrates & nitric oxide shut down collagen production.  So if a child eats a lot of nitrates it will not be able to grow as Collagen is the main constituant of bone. No Collagen = short stature. Add milk to the mix and Nitric oxide production increases even more which means even less collagen and shorter stature. I remember a good looking tall boy at primary school and noticed he didn't drink his milk. The beautiful & the tall, their parents knew all about what to eat and what not to. Now they claim superiority over the people they poisoned and deformed with deliberate shit food. High Nitric Oxide levels reduce histamine levels. Histamine is vital for a lovely tan. High nitric oxide makes you white as a sheet. You'l never get a tan. Beauty is confered on men to feminise them and sucked out of women and non Jews so men & white Jews can claim superiorty in appearance. Ugly people have been poisoned and beutifull people have been deliberately beautified as a reward to people who poisoned everyone else. If you are not beautiful it may be because of food & intestinal bacteria. If you are beautiful your parents did evil for the elite Jews. Beautiful is now ugly and the ugly are victims of deliberate poisoning because they were not Jewish.
Muhammad Oling	28 yo singel broke, yeah i feel it now

Robin R	okay so I am 58....and 9/10ths..I LOVE the lyrics, the music and the soul he and the band put into it. My guess is EVERYONE has had the same deep emotional feeling about themselves and those who have hurt or betrayed us in our lives.   (I do still cringe a bit at the f-word though..I'm a grammy..what can I say? :)

Victor Rosales	I was placed in special Ed by mistake and as a result of that it brought intense bullying once kids my age knew where I had came from. My teachers thought I was mute but in reality I was just traumatized from the domestic violence I had seen and experienced and was to scared to speak for a long time I thought I was an outcast but then I learned to accept and who I was and what I went through! This song speaks right to me I cried the first time I heard it remember everyone has a story ! I love this song deeply 🖤

I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Patricio Retamal	for my nosum
RV Remaster	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run

Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

You're so fuckin' special

I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Kyojuro Rengoku	I wonder what special experiences I will experience in the future...I don't know if I'll have any interesting stories to share in the future, but I have hope...maybe at night at the subway...I see a woman waiting for her late train...or we are the last people at the diner right after losing our jobs...something sentimental. My life is not special enough. I think.

i SABOTEUR	I see beyond the words because the instrumentals override my ability to gaf. The one thing Radiohead excels in imo is their ability to manipulate their instruments especially the guitar work. They're both eccentric and extraordinary and imo blows away Coldplay.
i SABOTEUR	Such a amazing song...the way Johnny Greenwood plays, going crazy on the strings I was never aware of this until I actually saw the video which was 2 days ago Lol. I could never pick it up by ear when I heard the song throughout the years idk why.

Javestrella7 Pérez C.	Saben la chica que me gusta no parece interesada en mi pero si en los demás y me e estado dando cuenta de eso y escuchar esta canción me hizo darme cuenta de que no debería esforzarme tanto por una persona que ni me conoce ni me aprecia así que si puedo darle un consejo a una persona que está pasando por la misma situación solo puedo decirle que enserio pase el tiempo con personas que si lo a aprecien en vez de personas que jamás se darán cuenta de nuestra existencia.

Acts 15 Ministry	"Ephesians 6:12
New King James Version
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.

Jeremiah 17:7
New King James Version
“Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, And whose hope is the LORD.

Ephesians 6:13
New King James Version
13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

2 Samuel 14:17
New King James Version
Your maidservant said, ‘The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.’ ”

Psalm 56:5-7
New King James Version
5 All day they twist my words;
All their thoughts are against me for evil.
6 They gather together,
They hide, they mark my steps,
When they lie in wait for my life.
7 Shall they escape by iniquity?
In anger cast down the peoples, O God!

Psalm 57:6
New King James Version
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; Into the midst of it they themselves have fallen. Selah

Revelation 18:20-24
New King James Version
20 “Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!”

Finality of Babylon’s Fall
21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall not be found anymore. 22 The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore. 23 The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived. 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.”

Romans 6:10
New King James Version
For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.

Matthew 24:7

Cuando estuviste aquí antes
No podía mirarte a los ojos
Tú eres como un ángel
tu piel me hace llorar
Tu flotas como una pluma
en un mundo hermoso
desearía ser especial
eres tan jodidamente especial
Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
no pertenezco aquí
no me importa si duele
quiero tener el control
Quiero un cuerpo perfecto
Quiero un alma perfecta
quiero que se den cuenta
cuando no estoy cerca
Tan jodidamente especial
desearía ser especial
Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
no pertenezco aquí
Ella sale corriendo por la puerta (corre)
ella se esta acabando
Ella corre, corre, corre, corre
Correr
Lo que te haga feliz
Lo que quieras
eres tan jodidamente especial
desearía ser especial
Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
no pertenezco aquí

She was one of the most beautiful sights I've ever had the privilege of experiencing and one of the kindest women anyone ever met. As time moves on, so do people and we hadn't seen each other for a few years when I learned that she had died of a rare type of leukemia at the age of 50. I still cry when I think of Vicky. If only I could have said goodbye. I loved her more than anything.

When you were here before,
Quand tu étais ici autrefois
Couldn't look you in the eye (1)

You're just like an angel
Tu as l'air d'un ange
Your skin makes me cry
Ta peau me fait pleurer
You float like a feather
Tu flottes comme une plume,
In a beautiful world
Dans un monde merveilleux
I wish I was special,
Et je voudrais être spécial,
You're so fucking special (2)
Tu es tellement particulière

(Chorus:)
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo (3)
Mais je suis un pauvre type, je suis taré
What the hell am I doing here ?
Qu'est-ce que je fous ici ?
I don't belong here
Ma place n'est pas ici

I don't care if it hurts
Ça m'est égal si ça fait mal
I want to have control
Je veux avoir le contrôle
I want a perfect body
Je veux un corps parfait
I want a perfect soul
Je veux une âme parfaite
I want you to notice
Je veux que tu remarques
When I'm not around
Quand je ne suis pas là
You're so fucking special
Tu es tellement spéciale,
I wish I was special
Je voudrais être spécial

(Chorus)

She's running out the door
Elle passe la porte,
She's running out
Elle s'enfuit
She's run, run, run, running out...
Elle court...

Whatever makes you happy,
Quoi que ce soit qui te rende heureuse,
Whatever you want,
Quoi que tu veuilles,
You're so fucking special,
Tu es tellement spéciale
I wish I was special...
Je voudrais être spécial."

N B	"I have a very special memory of this masterpiece...I was more or less twenty-three years old and had to wage a war against my parents in order to go to see the girl I loved in Istanbul from Italy. It was my first trip alone into a land pretty unknown to me. One night I waited for her for five hours in the rain while she danced with another boy in preparation for the upcoming university dance show. Then at some point I heard from outside the guys from the music club playing ""Creep"", embodying all the loneliness, the cold, the lack of support, the feeling of being invisible, the question of whether she cared or not about my presence there, deeply embodying that ""What the hell I'm doing here... I don't belong here..."""

Otto Simone	When i was 16 (long time ago now) i found a pablo honey cassette tape while browsing the music section in a used bookstore. later that evening i was hanging out with a girl who i had a huge crush on and i knew loved radiohead. being the delinquent i was at the time, i shoplifted it for her.  I had never listened to it. When we met i gifted it to her, she was over the moon excited. We drove around all night with it on repeat. I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. The combination of this music and the thrill off teenage love was incredibly overwhelming and i will never forget it. Incredible band, incredible music.

You're so fuckin' special

I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts

I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

Déjà Vu	I wish I was special
Jonathan T	“You’re so fucking special, I wish I was special”. This perfectly encapsulates the feeling of someone else being seen as “unique” just because they’re popular and have more power than everyone else, while on the other hand you’re seen as a creep or a weirdo because you’re a powerless outcast.

Infinity Music	we dont search for old songs but we search for old memories
Julian Close	I'm 52 and I only became aware of this song this year. This expresses something real, something that really hurts. That feeling of true, intense, almost unendurable attraction for a girl, coupled with the knowledge that she's not for you, that she's not even close to being for you, that she's so far from being for you that your very feelings are transgressive, that you've gotten above yourself by being in the same room with her. And hearing someone else express it makes you feel a little less shitty, or at least a little less lonely.

D4C LOVE TRAIN	This hits different due to my situation. I am a freshman in high school as of now, so it may not seem like a big deal but the thing is, I was moved into a different high school meaning I knew no one and my friends weren't here so I felt like a weirdo not knowing anything but hopefully I make it somehow

ae86takumi	When I first heard this song , I cried . Because it’s how I feel, “I am a weirdo, what the hell am I doing here ? I don’t belong here “  even at my 43 years of existence. Even with family , friends and having had relationships, never felt that I belonged anywhere. Always out of time and out of place .

Андрей Громов	Why are Radiohead afraid to go to Russia and give concerts in this country?  So nowhere did I find the answer to the question, what is the reason for this?
Андрей Громов	"Little blue skirt, ribbon in braid

 The girls at the party will gather in a circle
 Oh, how Lyubochka dances!

Isabelle	Эта песня такая красивая
Nina Salaxar	"Siempre una gran composición inspira. En este caso concreto esta canción está inspirada en la clásica composición de los años 70 ""Air That I Breathe"" del músico británico Albert Hammond que The Hollies hiciera famosa en 1974. En 1993 Radiohead, de forma inteligente para evitar pleitos legales larguísimos por plagio,  otorgaron los créditos de coautoría de dicha composición a Albert Hammond y Mike Hazlewood."

Manuel Saucedo	"I don't believe in A. 
Honestly people that ask for A do not know the real truth of its content. And those that do know that it's something that is incorrect before God. Luzifer promotes A. 
And other evil cultures that ask for A are not mine at all. My advise to you is don't drink A.

Ela doro	My uncle played his guitar every once in a while when i visited him and my grandma, sometimes he plays things i dont know. Sometimes he has to tell me what song it is for me to know how to sing along. But one time he played this Radiohead song and i waited until this part 2:24 to sing along. He looked up like wtf and didn't even finish the song, but I finished those high notes. Miss him.

Poupée_	When he’s not with me I feel something it’s joy I seriously don’t understand this feeling but when I’m with him I feel all nervous, and I wish I could straight up tell him how much I admire him but I can’t all I can do is listen when he talks, when he talks to me. When he talks to me I feel nervous and, but when he’s not there I feel so happy just thinking of him I really don’t understand this feeling and I don’t think I ever will but all I can do for now is think of a future with him. I’ve never felt this way about anymore before and it’s really cringing me out. Also, I really don’t think I will ever feel this way about someone again. I also really don’t care about my grammar when talking about him because I will never clearly talk about my feeling because I don’t understand them enough.

Hrundl Gamer	I don't like the genre and I don't know anything about the band...but I love this song and keep coming back to hear it one more time.
Charles Ross	"Well, yes, it's a good tune, very poignant tune, but as I read some of these extraordinary and ultra-profound comments, the song doesn't hold any marked place in my heart. 🤔

I just find it to be an intriguing, solid set of chords. attached to a delicious melody; as soon as I heard it I just cranked up the trusty 'Telecaster', dipped it in some tasty 'delay, echo, and reverb, and had at it. 😉"

Pooh Xi	"(Self-use)
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

FailFries	"How has it been like 30 years and I still come back to this song? And how does this song still leave my stomach twisted up in knots? It's because Radiohead is so ""very"" special...One of a kind...And this was only the beginning. Whether it's a song like this, which has been the anthem of countless angsty teens since the 90's, or their more experimental stuff that's flown under the radar for most, Radiohead has the ability to punch you in the gut and leave you saying, ""Thank you sir! May I have another, please!?"""

MrSpecstar	"The real reason Thom Yorke, not Radiohead, just that self indulgent c*nt hates this song is because it's shit and yet it's still the 'best' song he's ever wrote. This is the best of a pile of 💩 and yet he made millions from it. No wonder he hates it. One of his worst songs is second only

Tried to listen to some of their other songs as well. I know all music is not liked by all people, but I really don't understand at all. I can appreciate most any music.  Would rather listen to ""baby shark"" continually than wallow in their depressing sounding music. Don't hate me just my opinion. Can anyone enlighten me? Or is there some kind of inside joke as to why all the views?"

Second Account	"Reminds me of a girl I knew back in college. Long story short, I'd been into her for a few months, we were at a house party late one night, and she found her bf had cheated on her. She was the type who had a new partner every month and they always did the same thing. I was slightly wasted and figured I'd take my shot, but first I let her cry on my shoulder. She went to the bathroom, and I never talked with her again because she took every single pill she could find in there.

I know there was probably more to it, but low self-esteem teenage me was like ""Fuck, a girl just took her own life rather than give me a chance.""

I'm in my 30's now and nothing has changed."

Mayhem Discord & Chaos, Oh my!	"Being 56 and on the Boomer/Gen X cusp I've happily learned to embrace all genres of MUSIC and speaking from 400+ years of music experience there are ""a LOT"" of music pieces that move me Dobie Grey style (hat tip to those of whom understand the reference) but there are VERY FEW by ratio! Most bands/groups/composers that NEVER get heard of and we're talking 99% are lost to history or never made any. That said, this song will live forever and even though the band HATES this song, they should embrace it because as I said they maybe forgotten to time if not for this song! ""You've been Immortalized and yet you cringe"" haha!
I now understand WHY they hate this song, it IS their REAL face! 
I know it is one that resonates with me the same as everyone here....
And even though I hate him, I've embraced the Creep within and wanna know what happened? The Muthah Fukkah said I creeped him out! 😮‍💨
Tired of this shit!"

Vestor Flipsters	I was 13 when this song was on heavy rotation in the southern US. Unfortunately for yours truly, this song was a soundtrack that played over and over in my mind when I tried to envision myself with a lovely young lady. It’s only true if you allow yourself to believe that the God who formed you has intended for you to be “less than” or to have “less than” what you truly desire. Hard lesson to learn as a young person. I’m 40 now and have been happily married to my wife of 13 years and we have two beautiful sons and I teach them music but also how to navigate the messages that music can and does teach. I’m not blaming Radiohead for my misgivings, I completely own it. I was young and impressionable with a bad attitude. 😅 life goes on.

Artyom The Idiot	"This song captivates how I feel time to time. People get surprised if I show up to events. But when Im gone no thoughts. When I think about how my friends are doing now(that are no longer friends) i think of this song as I see how they are. Including my ex. Sometimes I will try to see what she is up to and this makes me remember this song. Because when I was friends with her i was just around. Nobody noticed nor cared if I was around or not. So sometimes I would get mad. My friend group was more friends with eachother than me. So I just felt like a creep the whole time I was around them. Sometimes I get like flashback emotions if you know what I mean. Where I will remember something and I will feel the emotions of it as if I was there. Theres multiple times where I just stood around and nobody would talk to me. Thats how my life still is. Its as if I'm just a side character. My now girlfriend sometimes completely ignores me and so I feel like this too sometimes. 

Then I get told I need to stop acting all negative. I guess they call it Doomer. Basically Ive just given up on pursuing anything. As long as I am alive it doesnt matter. It doesn't help that Im military and there is a possibility of me going to war with the china situation. So theres just no point"
Martha Yusko	Stop
Dark World	This songs hits really deep inside me. As someone who has been labelled as a weirdo and a creep by schoolmates, friends, and family members. Just for being different they reject me and my feelings, like I don't exist, like I have bad intentions, and like I don't know a thing about my own life. I know that some people hate me and reject me, I know I can't change how they feel or think, but all I can do is wish for them peace and happiness.

Vale la pena salir de la zona de confort e  intentarlo, piensa que todos somos seres humanos y nadie vale mas que nadie, entre mortales no hay dioses inalcanzables, puede ser un mal rato de rechazo o una vida de "" y si...?"""

Average Weeb	I loved her guys. I loved her so so so so so much. I don't know how I even got to be lucky enough for such an angel to talk to me, let alone notice me. I don't know what went wrong. I can't help but feel there is something she's holding back. I can't stop loving her and I hate myself for it. I can't stop wondering just why? How can such a beautiful thing end in the blink of an eye. I don't know what to do from here and I hate myself for it. I wish things could have ended happily ever after, but sadly that's just a fever dream. I love you Mars, and I can't do anything about it.

Surviving U.S. Soldiers out at Sea Need to Bravely Walk  into Kremlin & attempt to find the Ashes of PUTIN for World's Museum.

Nope NEVER, these were (CARE) never ever there Mr Xi.

86niisan8686	"fun fact: 
this song has 250x more views than subs, suggesting quality of the song is superb
diamonds by rihanna, a 2billion views video has only about 30x more views than her total subs
which shows you the artist and her genre gets more fans but a lower percentage of NONfans hold that song in high regard.
(no disrespect towards rihanna, shes a talented performer)"
Acosta de Jacinto Jorge Jesús	"It's so ironic how the most popular song of the band is actually the one that the band itself hates the most and it comes from the souless album they made.
Still a banger"

Ana Gómez	"Esta canción la conocí gracias a vos. No puedo evitar quebrarme cada vez que la escucho. Quisiera poder decirte que seguis siendo el amor de mi vida. A pesar de tus fallas, la decepción y el dolor que me causaste no me puedo arrancar este sentimiento tan grande que tengo hacia vos. Ojalá veas esto algún día.
Pd: Nuestra bebita está enorme y hermosa, me hubiera gustado que hayas sido el primero en cargarla en tus brazos las primeras horas de su vida, pero elegiste otras cosas y las respeté. Ojalá puedan conocerse algún día.
Son los amores más grandes de mi vida. Y lo siento si no puedo odiarte a pesar de haberme dejado en una etapa tan importante de mi vida, lo siento mucho por no dejar de quererte. Pero es más fuerte que yo. Te amo ♡ Los amo a los 2 ♡ Alaia y mi negrito por siempre♡"

Brendan A. MacWade	This single was released 30 years ago today. I didn't hear it until May 1993. And when I did, I realized that rock was quickly changing again on the heels of Nevermind and Achtung Baby. By 1997, Radiohead were the best active band in the world, until they stopped making records in 2016.

Zion Belton	"im about to be 20 soon, ive still never had a real girlfriend or any long term relationship. Theres this one girl i keep eyeing on my college campus. I see her everyday, and never say a word. i dont have the slightest clue as what the first thing to say to her is and if i should even approach her at all. Its not me being shy, i just dont know if its worth it at all. they say the worst thing that can happen is rejection, but I think ""rejection"" has taken its toll on me. I want to be adored, but I dont even think I believe in love in the romantic sense, especially in the modern day. idk if anyone will love romantically, idk even know if im capable of loving anyone in the romantic sense. Idk maybe I'm just too cynical for love.

just posting this to see if anyone feels the same."

J. Goebbels	"dudes, call me Ozymandias! i was everything. king/captain of everything: football, baseball teams. voted best personality and best looking of senior class. elected prom king. took the prom queen, who was valedictorian, to senior prom. f@cked more girls in high school than most dudes will their whole lives. college athletics scholarships. academic scholarships. job offers all over the world. i heard this song at a college frat house party when it first came out and thought it was the pussiest loser incel song I ever heard and instantly hated anyone who didn't like it.

now I am sitting here, after 20 years designing software for the greatest software company in the world. sitting here alone, my sweet asian baby left me a few months ago. i am old and beer-gutted and gray. no one will answer my messages on the dating site, i have no real job, no money, my face is wrinkled, my teeth brown. and i thought, I wanna go listen to that song.... that one from college, the creeper one.... so here I am.

this song hits hardest of anything, every word of it. like i wrote it today and went back in time and bribed 90s radio DJs to make it a hit . i wish i was special!
 
But, and this is the biggest, truest part of this very small but true story: all this loneliness and pain and abandonment and hurt, parents dead, sister in a nursing home, wife estranged, brother a homeless felon, daughter won't talk to me, can't keep a GF.... and you know who I miss? my dog!! the black lab boy I had after the divorce. it was just me and him for years. he died (the freaking unfaithful loser!!!) and i cannot get over him, because to him, i was the most special person in the world, right up till he passed out from the vet's final shot.

""outside of a book, a man's best friend's a dog. instead a book, it's too dark to read."" mark twain (another very special creep)"

Destroy X	worst radiohead song
tookymax	"""What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here."" Great lyric, to me it ties the whole song together. Life's ultimate question, why are we here? He sings out to whoever listens, like only a young male with hormones raging over a woman can express. We all wish we were better in some way and he's down on himself for lack of confidence. People can relate to this because at some point in our life we were depressed about something. The good news is that it passes, and we learn to overcome our weaknesses through perservence. Don't give up, it's always darkest before the dawn. It's all part of being human. Sing it for all of us, we can relate!"

MJL	The chorus is how I feel right now
RoboEyeglass101	"I remember buying the cassette of The Bends in March of 1993. I was a senior in high school. I had a hard time fitting in due to my stutter at the time, my wimp body and my outsider approach at the time. From about 8th grade until this point, I was in to bands like Husker Du, REM, Dead Milkmen, NIN, Public Enemy and such. By the time my high school years were concluding, I had enough. I was tired of the world. The sitting in my bedroom listening to Depeche Mode's Violator.. writing sad ass poetry about ""a girl I couldn't have."" So, when this song hit my radar due to my friend (who usually turned me onto such things, aside from NME), it really made me feel like a place was there for losers like us. Throw this in with Beck's Mellow Gold which came out a year later, you had a pretty great gateway musical drug to other bands that helped me get by. Creep is most definitely a song of it's time and generation, and may have lost some of it's edge since '93, but I think it really proclaims that angst that Grunge and Post grunge was growing into."
Clara(i)ta	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"
rem	"made a schoolwork about radiohead today, given i love radiohead more than almost any other artist. my group left me doing it by myself while they helped another friend of theirs finish their work. today was the presentation and i got insanely made fun of because radiohead isnt so known where i live, got made fun of because i usually listen to metal music and they were like ""thats heavy metal, yeahh!"" making forced expressions at me. the cherry on top was a girl on my group calling me ""quirky and different"" while ironizing, she said it loud enough for the entire class to hear and i never heard louder laughs in my whole life. never have i ever felt more like this song in my life.
im a creep. im a weirdo. i dont belong here."

Emanuel Batista	"Lyrics:

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

End."

WiLD CHiLD	"I've been feeling this since forever, but lately, it's been *_this_* times 100. I wasn't meant to be born. I was 3 months premature and the doctors said I was going to die. I spent more than 2 months in an incubator; the rest is history. I've always felt empty and purposeless like I don't belong here. Yet, here I am. My special, cross-eyed, mutt of a cat is the only thing that's keeping me from ending it all. 
Anyway, great song to listen to when you're so depressed that you want to end it all, but want to not die for reasons, like my cat."
sofia cabezas	Si la gente supiera un poco sobre lo frágil que es el autoestima para algunas personas,  cuidaría sus palabras y acciones las cuales si importan pero más a las personas que son sensibles emocionalmente,   una canción que no sólo habla de esto sino como a veces idelizamos a una persona frente a la poco autoestima que podemos tener de nosotros mismos,  you re so fucking special,  I wish I was special,  but im  creep.

Lyrics 
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

SoTired	"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16

God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time."

Jason Bourne	I have heard many other singers try to sing this song, but they all flop, if you don't sing this song from within your heart & mind you will look out of place & flop.
Versa Holubec	I don't see him anywhere. The one behind the song Come On stronger, in love with each other can stalk me,  I don't see him as a creep where i am. Not to make my heartache don't if can't be together sooner love that is fate. Not to put each other in agony pain in despair of loneliness.

313 Games	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"
David Lalremruata	"I have never listened to any other Radiohead song.
Go figure."
David Lalremruata	"I remember in the NEHU Campus in Shillong, India when we'd talk about music one of my friends used to use say that the intro to the distortion drenched part of the song was preluded by two ""guitar gun shots""! That was back in the 90s, so long ago ...yet, as I listen to it again tonight in Aizawl, India at 12:40 AM , it still resonates with so much meanings that only I will ever understand.
That's why this song is so effing special!"

Drtriipe	After a long period of analysis, me and my team have determined your music is simply not good. It’s not your fault, your music is simply unable to be enjoyed. To avoid further embarrassment, we highly recommend retiring, as it would be best for everyone. We hope you understand.

Kevin gabriel Centeno Rodríguez	Uff me dieron ganas de pegarme un tiro
udr4kin.x1	minha namorada deu um tempo cmg a alguns dias, ela falou que está confusa com o que sente, mas ainda  sim parece demonstrar q gosta de mim ainda, isso me deixa tao confuso e angustiado, queria saber oque se passa na cabeça dela, como ela se sente, o por que disso tudo. O pior de tudo é que eu convivo todos os dias com ela na escola, e, olhar o jeito q ela me olha, só me faz ficar mais pensativo e confuso com tudo isso. Ta tudo dando errado na minha vida, meu celular foi roubado, ela ficando assim cmg, tudo virando uma bola de neve, um turbilhão de emoções, mas o que mais me incomoda é não saber oque ela sente em relação a gente, queria poder sentar e conversar com ela sobre isso, mas sinto que não vamos chegar a lugar nenhum com isso, só oque me resta e sentar nessa cadeira e ficar ouvindo essa música.

blueskin7377	This song helped me so much when I still had my gym membership, It made they made me feel like an outcast when I would stare at the girls working out and they would get mad over something as little as that.. When I would show up, yeah some girls would run , run , run out that gym door. I then realized as the cops escorted me outside the gym and warned me not to come back. That it wasn't that I was a creep or a weirdo, no it was just that I was nobody special. I gained my confidence back and bought a whole season of front row seats to women's fantasy football.

LinkinParkRulz 227	My brother committed suicide last weekend by overdosing on something. He was found with headphones on, presumably listening to something. This is his youtube account. He made a playlist containing 6 songs that was edited the day he passed. This is one of the 6 songs. With the method he used, he was dead after about 30 minutes, probably unconscious around 12 minutes. I like to think that it was peaceful for him with his music on. I love you Myles, I'll miss you everyday for the rest of my life.

So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

Christian Soto	Creep is a great song because hating it is also a Radiohead reference
S A	"I remember reading that the band didn't want to play the song for a while because I think they thought it was negative but I don't see the song as negative I think it's really a positive song.

I know the singer had his reasons for writing it but for me I feel that he wrote it at the time that he was innocent, and I just feel that he was looking at the woman he wrote it for and such a beautiful way he was looking at her like here you are this beautiful woman and I'm just creep.  I thought him riding those lyrics were very genuine and they were actually very sweet.  Like to message was you're so beautiful and I'm not worthy of you.  It showed that in a way he was humble even though he felt unworthy and he never hurt her or anything he just felt unworthy and just adore this woman not knowing what to do.  

And the singer was always special really and once the woman came to see him perform this song she saw he was special and I wondered if she thought man I should have paid attention to him lol!. 

Everybody special so the singer was always special he just didn't realize it.  I think it's a song that allows people to feel they're not alone but to remember that they are always special.  

As a female singer-songwriter guitarist myself I have such a passion for reading other musicians music and his song was absolutely beautiful and his voice was as well."
S A	"This singer is beautiful Inside and out. Georgeous voice.  Not in to the f word in-between. I liked it when he says your so very special or even freaking special but what the hell it's a great song.  

I think it's so cool how the singer sometimes would moves intensely when the music gets intense, then it gets intense after he says I'm a creep and he just jerks like it surprised him. He did that when they performed on a the Conan O'Brien night show in 1993.  It was cool, sexy and adorable.  

Whether he sings it intensely or not it's beautiful both ways. This video with him singing this song later on in the years was less intense but still cool and beautiful.  They get better with age and all their music still rocks today.

Your special Thom, your an angel, you were never a creep or a weirdo, you were special always and yet the woman you wrote this for saw you on stage and saw how special you were and probably thought man, I should have paid attention to him. 

Thom, a man with a beautiful angel voice and stage presence till this day.  with an awesome band. 

Love you.  💖"

Norah	Conocí a una chica en mi cumpleaños por internet, y resulta que cumpliamos el mismo dia y teniamos la misma edad. Todo iba bien, hablamos un año sin vernos en persona y en nuestro cumpleaños de este año (24 de julio) decidimos vernos. Hice una hora de camino en coche para verla, todo fue perfecto, estuvimos juntos horas y ella no se separaba de mí. Cuando volví a casa, me fui a dormir sin más, y al dia siguiente al despertarme ella me había bloqueado en absolutamente todo. Esta era nuestra canción. Es la mujer más bonita que he visto en mi vida...

S A	"I remember reading that the band didn't want to play the song for a while because they thought it was not good for th to play it but I really think that it's the most awesome song I've ever heard. 

I think that the singer wrote the most amazing song I've ever heard. When he sang it and performed it on stage he sang it with such awesome intensity and deepness and the way he uses his voice was incredible.

He's also incredibly beautiful himself. Here he was in awe of a woman while he himself was actually beautiful and gifted never knew it. Imagine if he talked to her and what could've been. 

Nevertheless it was meant to be for him to have a different journey of blessings in his life. 

I don't see the song as negative I really think that it's positive. I think the way the singer wrote it  was being real.

 The fact that he wrote it for a woman that he was following was showing that he really loved this woman and at the time he just didn't have the esteem or the courage to meet her.  It shows other people that they're not the only ones that go through something like that and it's something that you can get through if you work on it.  

If the singer really thinks about it, the woman ended up coming to see him and watch him after all the time that he cared for her and watched her she came to watch him. So all actuality his dream came true because she's watching him now.  what he doesn't realize is she's watching him, he is special,  on stage and is successful and more confident in his life and she got to see that.

I also considered the song positive because the guy is saying that here is a beautiful woman but he can't talk to her and he wishes he could be special just like her so he can talk to her.  

I think it's the most courageous and real song I've ever heard and I think it's the most beautiful song I've ever heard.

  I never stop listening to it and watching the singer sing it. They will be a legend in their own time. 🥰"

Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

lnformacione por ti espiritualidad (F.G. di Roma tomates)	"*Revealing world wide satanic conspiracy. Urgently look at a hidden message on Sainte Peter's Basilica, in Rome Italy!  Encoded in the statues on the building, for telling WW3!*  Look at these bible scriptures as further proof, Romans1:23, Deuteronomy5:8, Romans1:25, Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18, 18:4,6,24;John the Baptist, Jesus....Roman soldiers Peirced him, not Jews  The Mark of the beast is on the shield of the Empire and on top of their buildings.  *666 is on the three level crown(vicarivs filii dei).* Germany concealing historical information about WW2 and that Nazi war on Russia, which killed more of their population than almost all other nations involved combined.  The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though informed.  *The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible's for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD was the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul(Emperor Justinian).*  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2. *Turkey and Arab States are where Gog and Magog are of the Bible's Ezekiel 38, and surrounded by seas(Walid Shoebat), which to be driven in to as per the Bible's description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the ""seat of Satan"". Constantinople(Roman Emperor Constantine's city, now Istanbul, Turkey) was headquarters of Rome in the past. Rosh means head, but just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn't mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Gog Magog war comes after the 1000 years of peace on earth.* A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor Ron Desantis, for speaking about Biblical matters. *He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  This is war over knowing God. The US claims to believe in Democracy and has in God we trust on money, but are attacking God.*  80% of US money has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.  *NATO must be broken up, and is the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nations to take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries, as enemies of you and the world.*  Take away their terror production ability.  *NATO changed the name of Ukraine's Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace. US Senator Jim Risch on video says,""we can not let this end"", when reffering to the Ukraine war.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+). They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.*  Revelation 18:6,24. *The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God's temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the (false) temple with 666 on his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).*  US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine's war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow). That was before this so called invasion.  US's Mike Pompeo also said that the war would start in 2017.  *President Donald J. Trump said over 3 1/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.*  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. *NATO is the military arm of the beast system. (M.O.B. (cross/X) on flag). People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals. Bow to what the image(cross/2crossed swords of Islam/X of Rome) represents or die.  Catechism of the Catholic Church say no ""buy or sell"" or greeting to any who leaves the cross(Church). Those who don't accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.*  Remember this! No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  *Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the offensive attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers. NATO Countries are stealing Russian assets claiming on account of the war, but it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.  So seaze NATO property, confiscate their money in your Country, stop their monetary transactions and send them packing.*  Do to them, what they were doing.  *Why does the Roman Empire and Church(called Roman Catholic Church) exist, when the Bible in Revelation 17,18 says it is evil and responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth?  Verse 6 of chapter 18 of Revelation says to pay her back double for what she has done to others.*  Is Donald Trump a prophet, or was he just ahead of schedule proclaiming wars with Russia and China?  *Think!*  The war with China hasn't even started yet, but it was Trump saying that the corona virus started in China.  *He thought he could get you to start a war through that, but it is not China spraying your cities just before outbreaks.* Look up, see spraying!  *Taiwan has no embassies, as it is not a Country, but a part of China, as openly acknowledged till recently(accept Lithuania, which is going to be used to start war on Russia and China).*  Trump authorized ""operation warp speed"" to force vaccinate by military force.  He authorized death by poison gas, electrocution and firing squad to the already authorized lethal injection. *America you are fighting for your life, don't choose cowardice, as the world counts on you!*  The world collectively belongs to all mankind.  *It is greedy people who try to usurp the resources and control.*  All people deserve dignity and their fair share. *This is not NATO helping Ukraine, but a NATO take over of Ukraine and war on Russia. Ukraine was part of Russia.(Russian language and history being hidden).* Biden stopped 3 gas pipelines and all exploration in Alaska, but didn't even envite the largest electric car company to an electric vehicle fair. US future walkers?  *How many nations of the world will be attacked by an alliance that the Bible calls satanic before people realize it must be stopped?*  Revelation 18:4 ""Get out of her my people""   NATO-Rome/UK attacking Acts2:44. *Taking a righteous stand is never easy, and God says no COWARDS will inherit his Kingdom.* Research Boris Johnston's "" plan A"", corona virus deaths not working, WAR!  *New vaccines for new variants, with out testing and very quickly, how?*  Prince Charles was recorded hugging the Pope and congratulating him on his war.  What war?  British Royals own video. *NATO is planning to go to war with the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but Russia had no right to defend themselves from the NATO aggressors militarizing Ukraine with the goal of destroying Russia, and attacking Russian loyalists(NATO only defensive lol).* Carefully Share this information and pray for Russia and Ukraine, and *clear browser and site history!*    Sweden/Finland extremely militarized with M.O.B. on equipment and on Russia's border. *Think!  Remember the German Nazis?*  German tanks in Ukraine and Lithuania.  *When media disallows commenting is because of deception.  Unbiased media that hides opinions(how can that be possible?)*  2400+ Nazis(Nazi tattoos) surrender to Russia in Ukraine.  *NATO is headed for a trap that they will not be able to get out of. US President admits, behind the NATO proxy war. Unless the US people stop what is happening, get out of the US, get out of the US!*  Roman Catholic Joe Biden is making moves, like Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler.  *Rome and cronies attacking businesses and products.* Think!  Corona/monkey pox(they're changing the name)/leopard pox/*heat lockdowns* about to arrive world wide compliments of Rome/UK. *UK saying the culling of ALL domestic animals coming(Pharaoh like control, bow or die).*  2 US billionaires say US dollar collapse and civil war coming. *(G7 ban Russian gold to prop up their fiat currencies, based on faith, but not faith in God, 2Corinthians4:4)*  The great reset before being hijacked by Nazi billionaires was that every man will have property including his own fig tree and grape vines(obviously a dwelling), which became the you won't own any thing and you'll be happy.  *These are the guys attacking Russia and Ukraine(like WW2).* 
 Stallenburg admits NATO was providing Ukraine heavy weapons for a long time(NATO, defensive?). *Bitcoin=gold backed decentralized, Church/State digital currency=faith backed, centralized/enslavement 2023.* The UK imported a king from Germany @WW2 to marry the British Queen and take her last name, fooling the masses. *WW3=WW2=Rome's war on Acts2:44. Select, copy, paste, email and print, and repeat.* NATO has Russian weapons. *Leaders of Ukraine military, foreign.  The war was going to be a distraction from the G7 digital dollar of 2014, 2017, but failed to arrive then, but will arrive 2023. Russian gold banned, to protect fiat $. I'm not Russian, so quit attacking them!  Rome starting WW3 to hide exposé.  *WW1=WWincome tax, think!* Angola, Japan = Rome. NATO now sinking ships preemptively.(Thought Police/executioner) Wow NATO defensive? Europe using fires to push WW3 agenda against Acts2:44.  Rome using high temperatures from spraying as a cover to burn down businesses and homes.  Rome proxy war. !+(!("

John Panicker	"I remember crying to this song, the first time I heard it at 15. I never resonated with a song as much as I did with this. I grew up in my teens with a cleft lip and assymmetric features. It was difficult, went through depression and had to consult a therapist.

6 years later I'm in a relationship, happy and content. It's still a good song, but I just hear the angst and resentment I felt as a teenager. 

You don't need a perfect body or soul to find love. You just need to be a good person, content with who you are, completely. That's more than enough. Maybe I'm not old enough to be giving out such advice, but for any struggling teens here, hating yourself makes finding someone way more difficult. Being a teenager is difficult. You don't know what you want or who you are. The hormones surging through your brain makes it easy to fall into depression. But you'll get through it, I believe in you.

 You don't have to like yourself, but you need to accept yourself. There's a big difference there."
Felipe Menezes	Alguém em 2022?
Erik Dornelas	Damn... this song got me... i, like every shy boy in the 90's, felt i didn't fit in anyplace, or with anyone... spend too much time alone, seeing the popular people living the life i desired for too long, but i couldn1t... parties, girls, money, or just somebody around... if you sang this song in your mind for that girl you loved, but she never knew that, you're not the only one, bro...

Venom	This is an absolutely amazing song, but to everyone that thinks this is their best work, I beg you to go listen to some of Radioheads other songs. As amazing as Creep is, there are like 50 other songs that are arguably better

Sheila Mcbain	I don't understand why radiohead hated this song.  It is the only  song I listen to by radiohead.  They are an OK group  but creep,isvthe best song.  If I want to listen to music that is one of my firsts.  I think radiohead needs to rethink creep.

Sheila Mcbain	This song I heard by Lucas rossi in supernova.  I loved his rendition then my son downloaded radiohead he said it was better.  But  I still love how Lucas Ross played it. I loved how he  interpreted and moved to the song.  Radiohead just plays it.  They don't have Lucas rossys choreography.   It will always be my favorite song.  Every word has so much meaning.  Just like an angel, screw these people who don't appreciate  greatness.

Vexify Social.	I know that I might now look like the type of person to be making this type of comment but generally. This song brings back my memories with somebody who took their life recently and it just still hurts because of the last comment I got from them it makes me feel the lyrics of the song entirely differently from what I used to.

I wish too really, if womens can open they eyes, and they can see more than mens look outdoor looked. I wish, if womens can see in mens hearts, and they dont care what look the mens uotside

Gracias por eso, creo que fue lo mejor."
diana	but i’m a jeep. i’m a dildo. or whatever shit radiohead said
Alma Loca	Cuando podés cantar esta canción sin llorar visceralmente es que saliste de la mierda. Creo que igual todxs nos sentimos raros y al borde del abismo en algún momento. Sólo que muchas personas lo esconden detrás de una obsesión por salir y no querer estar solx y pensar. No atreverse a encontrarse con esa oscuridad pero en algún momento hasta esas personas caen al fondo :*)

Eric M Goddard	Goosebumps throughout ❤️
eddiespike	I know why Thom Yorke doesn't like to play this, and I respect that. But to the rest of the people who love it, it remains as an absolute rock classic. Like many great songs, it doesn't need to be structurely complex. Look at Teenage Kicks...still sounds as great as the first time I heard it. The complexity of Creep is in the lyrics, which are sheer poetry, ripped out of the darkest recesses of the soul and spat out for everyone to hear and to deeply identify with. There's comfort in knowing that you're not alone in your weirdness. I hope that Thom can finally own his own words someday and belt this out, knowing how much good it's done. For me and for many others, it will always remain one of the greatest songs ever written, with Radiohead's rendition always being the most iconic and impactful.
jaqueline	this song really makes me sad :(

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Kwinquark1	How embarrassing it must be to have one of your best-known songs utterly mastered by a bloody big bunch of Belgian bints (that's a fair few 'B's) while your version is - well, dross? It's no wonder the band claim to hate the song later on. Check out the Scala & Kolacny Brothers version.

Paulo Matias	"The Rapture

For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.
Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.
I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.
Deuteronomy 30:19 R.M

WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?"

Ralph Kühl	Immer gerne Immer wieder das ist ein so  mega Song mit viel Gefühl gespielt
Cristiane Marques	Amores nao correspondidos nos fazem sentir assim, nao merecedor da atenção ou amor do outro, nos sentimos estranhos ao meio da pessoa amada, estamos foram do alcance. A aparencia fisica nao permite que estajamos proximos, ou que sejamos amigos. O importante é endender que o amor traz paz, e entao, qualquer sentimento que nos faça sofrer tanto pode ser sinal de desequilibrio, e isso nos afasta das pesseoas. Nao podemos deixar isso acontecer
Aqua Justice	Went to see these with a friend. I wasn't a big fan but loved Creep. Absolutely gutted, as were many other real fans, that they flat-out refused to play this despite the many many chants and requests. How can you create this and then not love it yourselves?
silvia Thelen	Nur geil
Nilanjana Chakraborty	WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE THE VOCALIST IS MOCKING ALL THE WEIRDOS
Deborah Dennehy	It's a good song, especially the music. Pity the lead singer was swearing, which ruins the material they write. To be honest, I prefer Brian Justin Crum, his song (the same) was most certainly 'special'. I don't hate Radiohead though!!

valery	Sometimes I wonder if I’m truly a girl or just a huge loser when I listen to this song
Jackson2009	"This badass crisp yet balanced ,w/
 hard chords, that they manage to keep just the right... Should we say strength in the chords throughout the song and not getting carried away like many other bands that try to go hardcore jamming on some chords so it balances between smoothness and Chris hard chords and the reason I'm telling you all this is because I'm 43 the song kicked ass when it come out the first day I want to say I was in 9th grade and judging from most of y'all's comments I'm assuming most of you are not 43 but also agree this song kicks ass and I'm not sure if everyone realizes an artist does not have to be Elvis Presley and produce $800 albums this song has more than paid for all of these gentleman's lives a very comfortable lives.... Now are they Nirvana no are they better than Def Leppard a band that was fading away as they were coming in obviously yes but whether they made a hundred more songs or just this one it would still be as cool as hell today as it was the moment to come on the radio and that tells you how old I am because yes they played this on the radio in your car without a subscription or a satellite following the radio around anyways I'll help my old ass off here now and let everyone get back to you know bickering back and forth about who's awesome and who's not this is one of those cases where it really doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to instinctively we know a good song when we hear everyone does when I was younger a lot of us didn't care much for rap but the moment Tupac hadn't seen I mean you knew those songs were awesome as hell so there is a little lesson here and that is you don't know what you don't know and it would definitely help you in life and by you I mean lots of people try not to judge something before you experience it a little bit mainly because that's a good sign of ignorance where you're discussing or talking is if you know about something that you've actually never had any experience with be it talking to someone who's homeless and you've never been homeless or being that asshole that argues with someone standing on the corner because you just assume you're going to use the money to go buy drugs which by the way who gives a fuck if that's what they're going to do the guy lives on the street you don't think he's on the right to take that $5 and go have him a couple moments of joy who are we to judge what he does with it if you going to tell someone homeless what to do with the money you give them don't give it to him I'm serious they got pride too I say this so hopefully I can tell I speak from experience I spent time in the Marine Corps I joined actually 6 days before 911 happened I've dropped out of college during my life I've ruined two marriages and managed to stay not even a high functioning but just not giving a damn completely addicted attic the whole 20-plus years so I know a little bit about being in someone else's shoes good morning that is when somebody tells you hey man listen to song and yes when did it come out and they might say the 20 or 30 years ago and you answer I don't want to hear that shit well you literally and figuratively don't know that and no I do Creek was when someone played this in the car but it didn't take two seconds into the song to realize it was listening to some bad ass shit that's how I feel about Weezer and Green Day Stone Temple pilots Nirvana Pearl jam and not to rub it in everyone's face but I can keep going the 90s had some badass bands and I don't know if y'all remember this was actually when groups formed practiced in in their friends garages during which time they developed the songs themselves they wrote the lyrics and they all played the instruments and they sing their own words and if you think in your mind back to the greatest artist of all time they all did that this is way before American idol we're just if you can if you can sing we'll give you the music and make you famous to me that's I just I try not to be shut out to anything but I just can't watch that shows music what I can watch is Nirvana unplugged cuz you can literally feel what the man is going through is he playing and that's what every great artist is able to do it is known fact if you're going to write great music it's got to come from pain from hurt and if it's real people who have no problem feeling it in the music it's undeniable now if for some reason Justin Bieber I wanted to start singing about well I don't know anything that Nirvana thing about I would have a hard time thinking those were his own words if I found out they were I'd give him all the credit he was due but considering I played piano for 12 plus years taught myself guitar and got myself into college I did drop out but let's be honest I got into college so that's what sort of counts I mean never were really mean something it could be useful but people do feel a little better talking to someone they never made it to College they feel like they may be having somewhat of an intellectual conversation of course I say that I'm not a Republican and I don't like Trump and I live right smack in the middle of Georgia so I've always gone against the grain but this time I don't think that's going against the grain and I think that's more along the lines of we cannot seriously let this idiot be in charge of our country there's a chance that some shit can go really bad and there might not be in America and if you really have those thoughts in your mind about the person you voted for be truthful to yourself because while I never was particularly a Republican I did tend to lean Democratic but mostly I was independent but these days is what they're calling the Republican party at any other time period in history will be considered an outcast group that was trying to take over the government they literally look you guys in the eye every night on TV and just say complete bullshit with a straight face now just CNN have people that may fudge the facts when they talk a little bit sure all news outlets do but they also have a theme of truth that runs through it and you can sense that if you watch it but if you flip over and you see turtle Carlson you need to realize that you're intelligence level will probably drop a few points wants to show is over Fox News just like Trump has played on the ignorance and fear of the people in the south they have played us like a fool I know this because Trump doesn't care about the Evangelical Christians in the south if he even was remotely religious first of all he was born Catholic family and his life's been in New York City and in my experiences traveling around in the world that's a couple of descriptions of someone that probably doesn't give a damn about what's going on in Georgia and Alabama but I was amazing the people that would go to this guy's rally and stand there and cheer like some lost Colt just to a guy not to an idea not to a country or to better yourselves but just literally suck in all the bullshit only share all this so maybe that one person out there realizes that there are some of us in Georgia who haven't lost all of our senses and I say that a little hesitantly because Biden and a left be honest it's almost like the Democrats don't even realize they're in charge of all the branches right now they're getting nothing done in the moment Mitch McConnell is back in charge of the Senate well you can kiss getting anything done then goodbye it's almost like some of the senators and congressman pride themselves on filling their constituents with complete shit and immediately turn into their new jobs and spending the whole time worried about being reelected and not ever once acting on anything it would benefit or change the lives of the people that put them there in the first place as much as I love America at some point we're all going to have to admit the system is greatly flawed and we wanted the whole thing from Ukraine back in the beginning of years ago because they had corruption in their government who in the hell are we to point out corruption in the government that's literally how our government operates peace y'all have a good evening"

CALI-BUD-GROWER	"The Warzone version of this song-

When you were here before, couldn’t look you in the eye, I have anxiety issues, I’m really really shy. You float like a power up, in a 2d sky,
I was I had specials moves, some sick fucking specials moves.
But I’m a geek, I’m a gamer. I get a lot of kills. I aim for the head. 

I don’t care if we die, I want to take control, 
I to take grandma’s house, I’m ready to roll

I want you to notice, when I’m on the ground,
I need a revive now, just a quick revive now,

But I’m a geek I’m a gamer, I get a lot of kills 
I aim for the head oh oh 
He’s running out the door, 
He’s running out
He runs runs runs runs

Whatever makes you kill easy 
Whatever gun you want,

I wish I had special moves, some sick fucking special moves, 
Cause I’m a geek, I’m a gamer, 
I get a lot of kills, I aim for the head, I aim for head 



When your were here  before, I couldn’t look you in the eye, I had no plates left, I didn’t want to die,


- positive energy, peace and blessings to everyone!"

Bizzquick	13 years later and this still fully represents today's sort of teenage mindset; wanting to be noticed and not feeling generally out of place i guess, it's how i see it least but its what [girls] tend to feel ab their [boyfriends] and comparing themselves to others

I SPOKE TO HIM AND DIDNT EVEN MENTION THAT I KNEW WHO HE WAS AND WE JUST CHATTED RUBBISH TO EACH OTHER AND WHEN HE LEFT HE GAVE ME A HUG AND SAID HOW MUCH HE HAD ENJOYED OUR 2 HOURS SAT AT THE BAR

I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

What the hell am I doin' here?

I don't belong here"

Ketika Anda berada di sini sebelumnya
When you were here before

Tidak bisa menatap matamu
Couldn't look you in the eye

Kamu seperti bidadari
You're just like an angel

Kulitmu membuatku menangis
Your skin makes me cry

Kamu melayang seperti bulu
You float like a feather

Di dunia yang indah
In a beautiful world

Saya berharap saya istimewa
I wish I was special

Kamu sangat spesial
You're so fuckin' special
Tapi aku bajingan
But I'm a creep

saya orang aneh
I'm a weirdo

Apa yang aku lakukan di sini?
What the hell am I doin' here?

Saya tidak termasuk di sini
I don't belong here
Aku tidak peduli jika itu menyakitkan
I don't care if it hurts

Saya ingin memiliki kendali
I wanna have control

Saya ingin tubuh yang sempurna
I want a perfect body

Aku ingin jiwa yang sempurna
I want a perfect soul

Saya ingin Anda memperhatikan
I want you to notice

Saat aku tidak ada
When I'm not around

Sangat istimewa
So fuckin' special

Saya berharap saya istimewa
I wish I was special
Tapi aku bajingan
But I'm a creep

saya orang aneh
I'm a weirdo

Apa yang aku lakukan di sini?
What the hell am I doin' here?

Saya tidak termasuk di sini
I don't belong here
Dia berlari keluar pintu (lari)
She's running out the door (run)

Dia kehabisan
She's running out

Dia lari, lari, lari, lari,
She run, run, run, run,

Lari...
Run...
Apapun yang membuatmu bahagia
Whatever makes you happy

Apapun yang kamu mau
Whatever you want

Kamu sangat spesial
You're so fuckin' special

Saya berharap saya istimewa
I wish I was special
Tapi aku bajingan
But I'm a creep

saya orang aneh
I'm a weirdo

Apa yang aku lakukan di sini?
What the hell am I doin' here?

Saya tidak termasuk di sini
I don't belong here

Saya tidak termasuk di sini
I don't belong here"

Frau Rotkohl	"Im Auto mit 18 unterwegs, die erste große Liebe neben mir, das Lied voll aufgedreht.
Die Gedanken vollkommen durchströmt mit Belanglosigkeiten.
Gedacht das nur das eine wichtig ist….!
Jetzt hat man das eine (Geld) und merkt das man damals so sorgenfrei und naiv war, wie man es jetzt nicht mehr sein „darf“!
Diese Musik versetzt mich genau wieder dahin zurück und es kribbelt in meinem Bauch…."

Grant Etipsen	"«Creep» «Слизняк»

(Radiohead):
When you were here before     
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

(Radiohead):
I wish I was special
You're so mucking special

(Radiohead):
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

(Radiohead):
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna perfect body
I wanna perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

(Radiohead):
You're so muckin' special
I wish I was special

(Radiohead):
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

(Radiohead):
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

(Radiohead):
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so muckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

«Слизняк»

(Radiohead):
Когда ты была здесь до этого
Я не мог смотреть тебе в глаза
Ты просто как ангел
Созерцая твой образ, я рыдаю
Ты паришь, как перышко
В этом прекрасном мире

(Radiohead):
Жаль, что я не особенный
Ты же чертовски особенная

(Radiohead):
Я всего лишь слизняк,
Я человек со странностями
Что, черт возьми, я делаю здесь?
Мне здесь не место

(Radiohead):
Мне все равно, больно ли это
Я хочу себя контролировать
Хочу иметь красивое тело
И красивую душу
Хочу, чтобы ты замечала
Когда меня нет рядом

(Radiohead):
Ты чертовски особенная
Жаль, что я не особенный

(Radiohead):
Я всего лишь слизняк,
Я человек со странностями
Что, черт возьми, я делаю здесь?
Мне здесь не место

(Radiohead):
Она снова уходит
Она уходит
Она уходит, уходит
Уходит…

(Radiohead):
Независимо от того, что делает тебя счастливой
Независимо от того, чего ты хочешь
Ты чертовски особенная
Жаль, что я не особенный
Я всего лишь слизняк
Я человек со странностями
Что, черт возьми, я делаю здесь?
Мне здесь не место
Мне здесь не место"

Max da plush uwu	Anyone remember this from the book of life?
ivanus	The early 90s was characterised by this melancholic angsty sound in rock on both sides of the Atlantic. Its like everyone got so tired of hair metal they went into full blown depression. Or maybe the Cold War ending brought a malaise.

SlowUnsteadyTV	"Although I love this song but I hate the fact that a lot of people still think Radiohead is a one hit wonder. I just want them to know that they did made more music and it wasn't just music but pure art. They evolved with their music and became something much bigger than just a 90s rock band. They chose a more artistic path then a normal mainstream rock sound and went more ambient and dark with their music that most of the general music listeners wouldn't like. Basically they started their experimental style with The Bends, perfected it with Ok computer, and made it godly in Kid A. To me, Kid A isn't just a couple of songs (cause it's really not), but a tool that helps me escape to a very dark, eerie and dreamy world that I really like to stay in for like 50 mins. And just so you know, I can guarantee that non of the biggest Radiohead fans ever liked the albums like Ok computer or Kid A at the first listen. They made their music so complex compared to what they did before that it literally take you a lot of relistens to get used to the Radiohead's music. Kid A is one of the top 20 greatest albums of all time acc to Rollings Stones. It's considerd as the biggest left turn in music history. Not just Kid A, but Ok Computer and In Rainbows are easily masterpiece. Their first album, Pablo Honey, which features the song Creep is actually considered as their worst album. I mean, atleast compared to what they did later.

They basically went from a usual rock band that people listen just for passing the time to a music group that music students would study about. They went from a commercial action movie to an artistic cinematic masterpiece film."

The key is not to indulge in our insecurities, but thrive on our positive uplifting moments in life. We are all amazing Souls of light just trying to thrive in this world of positive and negative emotions. Stay positive, experience love and joy and help others experience it as well and you will do fine. God bless.

vecna's dog	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Yasmin Helen McEwen	"the voice is high and tinny very oftentimes drugged up and slurred a rollercoaster slide up and down sloppy scales he thinks the ladies want to hear him
he positions himself
just so
pillow talking long into the night long into the dawn his own kind of drugged up special kind of nonsense like the special nobody ordered
served up anyway
she is fighting for her life
Cancer has come to call
he has no care for her
or her Cancer
or her pleading
To just
Let her
Sleep
his only mission is to
bring about the most intense
Prolonged all night pain into her life
he positions himself
just so
with that very same
Creepy ass voice
sending her terrors on repeat
keeping her
from sleep
the Creep
he thinks his voice
sounds nice

like her step-dad
as he raged over her when she was
a little girl

he looks exactly the same
these Monsters never change
just like when she was little and begging
Please
Let
Me
Sleep
The Creeps always 
ignore her
every single night
the creep
Positions himself
just so"

B i fuckin love you, and I totally look like an creep, cuz ily him without talking to him so much, but i'm in love with the green of your eyes, the way you are, so gracious, lazy and intelligent at the same time. Obviously u are handsome, and i like that we have some things in common. I love creating in my mind a life with you. Ily so much, thought I'll never tell you my feelings for u.

Stiven Valencia	"Letra en español:



Cuando estuviste aquí antes,
yo no pude mirarte a los ojos.
Eres como un ángel,
tu piel me hace llorar.
Flotas como una pluma
en un mundo hermoso,
desearía ser especial,
tú eres tan especial.
Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
No importa si duele,
quiero tener el control,
quiero un cuerpo perfecto,
quiero un alma perfecta,
quiero que tú te des cuenta
de cuándo yo no estoy a tu alrededor.
Eres tan tan especial,
desearía ser especial.
Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
Ella otra vez se va corriendo,
ella se va corriendo, corre...
Lo que sea que te haga feliz,
cualquier cosa que quieras,
eres tan, tan especial.
Desearía ser especial,
pero soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar,
no pertenezco a este lugar."

AJ Kenly Lazarte	This is the song the band hated not cause it's bad but because this song was the past of the main singer and how he was a self-loathing stalker. He don't want to sing songs he don't rlly feel emotionally attached to.. He probably grow as a person. Like how we all cringe back to us in the past

Mace	"I'm a Crepe






When you ate here before

Didn't see me on your plate

I'm sweet like an angel

My fluff makes you sigh

I ride a dessert cart

In a French cuisine world

I'm on today's special

The waiter's best special



But I'm a Crepe

A thin pancake

Why the hell am I heating up?

Poured out a white cup




I know if chef's cook me

I'll be bought and sold

I want a perfect filling

I want a perfect fold

I want you to notice

If I'm not quite round

I'm part of the special


The Blueberry Special


But I'm a Crepe

A thin pancake

Why the hell am I heating up?

Poured out a white cup




I'm running in the pan

Batter's running

I Run, Run, Run, Run

Cook...




You know you'll be happy

When I fill your tum

I'm part of the Special

The Blueberry Special

Damn, I'm a Crepe

A thin pancake

Why the hell am I heating up?

Poured out a white cup

Poured out a white cup"

sidtu sollal	I think that each one feels the importance that song has in their lives, maybe problems for some or memorable moments for others, for me it means how much it made me and what it makes me feel when listening to the drums, the guitar... the atmosphere in my room becomes new to me every time I listen to it, many problems made me tangible. Time later I listen to it again and it makes me remember everything that happened, if sadness and pain happen I feel that I can move on, and this song reminds me of it, thank you!

You're so fuckin' special

I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo

lanisita	nunca había escuchado a esta banda, pero ahora que el llego ha hecho que quiera interesarme  a cerca de las cosas que le gustan, creo que esta canción relata muy bien como me siento,  realmente quiero ser lo suficientemente linda y especial  para ir con seguridad a su lado y decirle lo mucho que me gusta y deseo estar juntos, pero sin embargo me siento tan simple y mediocre  puesto que solo soy una simple chica y el es el ser mas lindo que he conocido, es  tan atractivo, único y sobre todo.. mi amigo, por lo tanto solo me queda callar y sentirme miserable. Deseo ser bonita y segura de mi misma para poder sentir esa confianza de que soy mereciente de amor

J Burke	I recently turned 70 years old. Last month I discovered this song and Radiohead, and mind blown! I've become obsessed. I've listened to hours and hours and hours of Radiohead. One of the most sonically rich bands I've ever heard. And the lyrics and composition are so good. And then I went on and found Johnny Greenwood's movie scores! Holy shit! These guys are amazing.

And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:11-15)

Martin Lottiaux	"Tout a commencé ce jour 
Où t’es idées n’étaient plus saines 
Et ne voulait que profiter 
De la personne naïve que j’étais 
Tu disais m’aimer 
Et je te croyais 
Tu disais prendre soin de moi 
Et je donnais tout pour le faire en retour 
Tu disais vouloir m’embrasser 
Pour mieux me manipuler 
Mais je n’ai jamais compris 
Car derrière tes plans se dressait un sourire 
Un sourire contagieux 
Du moins, pour moi qui t’aimais 
Je parle bien de cet amour 
L’amour que peut de gens peuvent dire avoir connu 
Cet amour que tout le monde s’invente 
Moi je l’ai bien connu 
Cette naïveté qui s’instaure 
Dès que trop de confiance apparaît 
Putain je t’aimais 
Et toi tu ne pensais qu’à profiter 
Tu étais tout 
Mais tu n’étais plus rien 
Tu étais ce que j’aimais 
Tu es désormais ce que je hais"
Lucie Descôteaux	The lyrics talks to a all lot of people O.o
Martin Lottiaux	"Fais moi tout ce que tu veux 
Fais moi mal 
Brise moi
Déteste moi
Haïs moi 
Insulte moi 
Mais toute ta haine ne sera jamais rien 
Fasse à toute la beauté du monde qui m’entoure 
Toi tu n’es rien dans ce monde 
Tu n’es qu’une particule 
Alors brise moi, débarrasse toi de moi ! 
Mais tu n’y gagneras rien 
Car tu n’es rien
Une simple personne n’est rien 
Alors tu n’as aucune force contre moi 
Tu es nul 
Tu es stupide de vouloir te battre 
Je te déteste 
Mais la maturité m’empêche de le crier à haute voix 
Tu as voulu me détruire 
Mais au final j’ai su déjouer tout ce que tu avais préparé 
Car contrairement à toi, il me restait des personnes sur qui comptait 
Toi, fatalement tu n’avais plus personne 
Car ton seul but est d’anéantir 
De détruire ce qui t’entoure
Je ne te souhaite pas le mal 
Mais si tu meurs je ne pleurerais jamais 
Aucune larmes ne pourra sortir 
J’espère que tu comprendras 
Ce que j’essayais de te dire"
Martin Lottiaux	Oh les français dans les coms bougez vous !!! C’est l’un des meilleurs sons du monde entier !!!
David Lascano Cárdenas	"I'm a creep too, this song is a classic, it never gets old. I think I listened on the radio last year, currently I'm living on Madrid - Spain but I'm from Ecuador and I first listened to this song on a forum of a Video Game, on the community of a game, a mmorpg. The game name is Grand Fantasia Lat and it was on 2011, I'm not playing that game anymore but I'm still playing other kinds of games. Good memories though.
Good song, ""You're so fucking special, I wish I was special but I'm a creep, I'm a little. What the hell I'm doing here, I don't belong here... (8)"". 
The lyrics terrific and the voice superb.
A greeting from Madrid-Spain.

Soy un rarito, un fenómeno también, está canción es un clásico, nunca se queda vieja. Creo que la escuche en la radio el año pasado, actualmente estoy viviendo en Madrid-España pero soy de Ecuador y la escuché por primera vez en un foro de un videojuego, en la comunidad de un juego, un mmorpg. El nombre del juego es Grand Fantasia Lat y eso fue en 2011, no estoy jugando a ese juego nunca más  pero aún juego otro tipos de juegos. Buenos recuerdos aún así.
Buena canción: ""You're so fucking special, I wish a was special but I'm a creep, I'm a little. What the hell I'm doing here, I don't belong here...(8)"".
La letra es magnífica y la voz soberbia.
Un saludo desde Madrid-España."

Tatiana Ocampo	"Ésta música me enseñó y dedicó mi ex pareja, él sentía todo lo que detalla la música, y yo sonreía porque para mí era la persona más linda y buena, estaba completamente enamorada...

José antonio Albaortega	La libertad , esa grande desconocida desde nuestra infancia, de la que todo el mundo habla. Unos la critican de oídas , otros de vista , la mayoría porque nunca la sintieron. Siempre estuvo en el ático de nuestro pensamiento,  arrojada al sótano de nuestro subconsciente. Pobre de ella en estos tiempos de tormenta , que lo anegan  ( no se si se escribe así,  probablemente no ) todo.

꧁𝕸𝖔𝖗𝖇𝖎𝖉☃︎	"I’m autistic, gay and transgender man.
I’ve been to 6 schools throughout my life and I’m only 16. This song is extremely relatable, I’ve faced so much for being myself and I’ve always had the label of “weirdo” for being disabled, LGBT+ and not knowing how to “properly” communicate."

Xavier Washington	Idk man, I personally find it dumb to hate ur own song, especially ur hit, like imagine Michael Jackson hating Billie Jean, and refusing to perform it. He made hits continuously, but still played Billie Jean at every concert. It’s ok to have a signature song, if Michael was ok with it, EVERYONE should be ok with it.
Thomas S.	This song is a haunting reminder to me, of when I peepee poopooed my pants so hard that they ripped. I felt like a creep, especially a weirdo, when my excrement shot through my trousers at the 2019 Milwaukee, Wisconsin Powertool Expo.  There was not one singular power tool that could fixed what I had done.
Dewa Putra	"Whoever read this..
I just wanna make a confession..
I’ve been hurting my wife couple times (non physically) and i think she’s really done with me..
She walked away with our lovely son.. all i have now is just regret and hopes.. 
dear wife, i’m sorry that i hurt you..
I’m not a perfect husband and not a great dad for him..
I’ve been a dick for you several years, our son n you don’t deserve me as a role model..
But if there’s any little tiny hope for me..i will definitely take it and pushes my self for being a better human being, i would love to fix it..but if there’s no chances, i wanna say thank you, you’re such an angel..devil wouldn’t ever can be matched with an angel..you will never be replaced ❤"

imminhyung	"2022 y aún sigo escuchando esta canción, aunque me traiga recuerdos malos, aún asi la amo. Conocí a un chico que es de mi edad, íbamos juntos en primaria y mis papás son padrinos de sus papás, cuando pase a secundaria le deje de hablar y hace casi un año le volví a hablar y gracias a el mi vida empezo a mejorar un poco y gracias a el empecé a saber mas sobre mi y lo q es tener a alguien q siempre te apoye, pero ahora estoy sufriendo por el, el ya encontró a alguien mejor y q si lo hace feliz y yo la verdad estaba muy apegada a el y ahora dependo emocionalmente de el, y además yo sabía q pronto le hiba a aburrir y me iba a cambiar y si eso paso. El hasta m había dicho q le gustaba y yo me emocione demasiado porque ami también me gustaba pero después de eso me cambio y antes hablábamos demasiado y ahora solo es un hola y ya, en persona lo veía pero me daban muchos nervios al querer hablarle y cuando ya me había decidido se hiba, y tuve demasiadas oportunidades para decirle lo q sentía y nunca pude y hace poco íbamos en un recorrido y me fui con el y lo tome de la mano, me acosté en su abdomen, varias cosas, y yo me sentía demasiado feliz e igual iba decidida a decirle lo q sentía aunque el ya tuviera novia y mejor me retracte porq sabía q lo iba a incómodar y podía pasar cosas. Hace poco le dije loq sentía aunque no le dije todo y el me dijo q igual sentía lo mismo q yo pero no crei y hasta llore. Y ahora ya siento q lo molesto y no quiero q pase eso y mejor me distancie de el. Siempre q escucho está canción la mayoría de las veces lloro y me recuerda a el, y gracias a el amo mas  esta canción<'3

Couldn't look you in the eye

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)

Sin embargo ha llegado el momento de mostrar toda la verdad, sácalo, sácalo todo y si es necesario no tengas piedad, por q lo q te hicieron lo harán con otros, es tiempo de terminar el ciclo, es tiempo de ser quien debes ser, no los perdones, no se lo merecen.

You're so fuckin' special

Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

Raccoon	Everyone has that moment of being an outcast by society, we see it from high-school to work. You always will be looked at as an outsider or a strange person. But we all move past those nay sayers and doubters, and prove to them that we are all unique in our own ways. And that nobody not a single living soul is an outcast. We stand strong. This song really captures those moments we all experienced or are experiencing in high-school and work

pepperachu	Imagine your an artist and make many paintings your proud of but people only want to see one or you scored the most goals one year and everyone wants to talk about that despite other achievements...yea some people are happy to ride the coat tails of that one moment, but in light of that I understand why radiohead resisted one of their great works, Creep.

Jeff Waldman	"One of my favourite songs of all time. As a person with a severe hearing disability and having faced and conquered many significant obstacles to life success, I always listen to Creep to remind myself of these things. It's taken me a very long time to be 100% content with who I am and be proud of what I have accomplished in life. I used to believe that ""I didn't belong in this world"" because of my disability and that I was very different. But, I learned that I DID belong on this planet and I had a role to play in making it a better place to be."

pepito mostoles	"Por mi edad, vengo de escuchar grupos de otra epoca como Pink floyd, Led zeppelin, Yes, King Crimson y mas, la verdad es que despues de los ochenta dejo de interesarme la musica , siempre con excepciones puntuales, como 
grupos maravillosos de los años ochenta, y temas ya legendarios en esta epoca que estamos, precisamente, Creep de Radiohead, la considero una cancion absolutamente genial y fabulosa, prodigio de inspiracion y buenhacer, de hecho Johnny Greenwood, en esos riffs de guitarra que introduce, le da el poder y la garra de una manera brutal a un tema que parece melodico y suave, fenomenal melodia y armonia.

         Sencillamente, unico, irrepetible y colosal, amo esta cancion."

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy

Kumo Z	Makes you think how society and music influences how you’ll act and what social groups you’ll be conformed to when you can look back at a music video and see that you are your own person and move forward knowing you can change the future for yourself. Conformity is your own choice. Good moment

Tony Serrano	I love how the song slows down and then the guitars and lights kick in then it slows down again and I must say that his voice and flow of the song in how it changes is just Fantastic. I would really love to hear more songs similar to this kind of style and flow and the beats are off the Charts in this song and not many songs will beat this one.💰👍This style of music for this song is absolutely sensational.

Picco8703	"Als du früher da warst
Konnte [ich] dir nicht in die Augen schauen
Du bist genau wie ein Engel
Deine Haut lässt mich weinen

Du schwebst wie eine Feder
In einer wunderschönen Welt
Ich wünscht ich wäre besonders
Du bist so verdammt besonders

Aber ich bin ein Ekel
Ich bin ein Spinner
Was zum Teufel mach ich hier?
Ich gehöre hier nicht her

Mich interessiert’s nicht ob es weh tut
Ich möcht die Kontrolle haben
Ich möcht einen perfekten Körper
Ich möcht eine perfekte Seele


Ich will, dass es dir auffällt
Wenn ich nicht da bin
Du bist so verdammt besonders
Ich wünscht ich wär besonders

Aber ich bin ein Ekel
Ich bin ein Spinner
Was zum Teufel mach ich hier?
Ich gehöre hier nicht her oh, oh

Sie rennt die Tür raus
Sie rennt raus
Sie rennt, rennt, rennt, rennt
Renn

Was auch immer dich glücklich macht
Was auch immer du willst
Du bist so verdammt besonders
Ich wünscht ich wär besonders

Aber ich bin ein Ekel
Ich bin ein Spinner
Was zum Teufel mach ich hier?
Ich gehöre hier nicht her

Ich gehöre hier nicht her..."

Otra cuenta feik más	Sé que mi comentario se perderá junto con los otros pero es una de las maneras en que puedo desahogarme. El escuchaba esta canción cuando estaba en su computadora, y yo estaba ahí en su cama, viéndolo trabajar pero me entraba una tristeza enorme cuando escuchaba esta canción por que me identificaba con cada palabra de ella, él era para mi la persona más especial que he tenido pero al caso contrario yo nunca lo fui para el, siempre deseé ser especial para el, pero no lo era. Y siempre me decía a mi misma que ¿CARAJOS HAGO AQUÍ? Pero luego recordaba La Paz que me daba estar junto a él, sus consejos, sus caricias, la manera en la que me hacía reír o las cosas que hacíamos juntos, esas pequeñas cosas que hacíamos juntos como ver sus series favoritas o películas que yo nunca había visto y para él eran súper geniales, y aunque no soy de ver películas ni series, me acostaba con él a verlas por que si, por que a él le gustaba. Las salidas a ir a comer a sus restaurantes favoritos, he incluso me enseño a comer cosas que nunca en mi vida había comido. El siempre estaba rodeado de personas famosillas de acá de su pais es por que él también lo es, y luego estaba yo, a alguien que no le gustan las cámaras y siempre está en la oscuridad. Después de unos meses entre en depresión por que yo lo amaba con mi alma pero para él yo era otra amiga con derecho más, nunca quiso algo conmigo y lo entendí al principio, pero luego no pude evitar pensar todo el día en él y contar cada segundo que faltaba para llegar a su casa y acostarnos juntos o simplemente para ir a ver cómo él trabajaba desde su computadora. Cuando estaba en un colapso mental recuerdo que lloré y el me preguntó que cual era el problema, y no supe decirle que el problema era el, bueno… en realidad no era el, era yo. Yo lo idealice de una manera totalmente diferente a lo que él quería inicialmente. Intente alejarme varias veces por mi bien pero intentaba y no podía, no podía dejar de verlo, no quería dejar de tocarlo, no quería dejar de verlo sonreír, por que tiene la sonrisa más hermosa del mundo, no quería no podía, quería que se sintiera amado, que perdiera el miedo que tenia y que confiara en que esta vez no iba a ser lastimado, pero yo no pertenecía ahí, ya tengo 7 meses que no lo veo, 7 meses que no veo su carita, su sonrisa, que no me acaricia ni me hace cosquillas para reirme, me moriré de ganas de decirle que lo voy a echar de menos y solo espero que alguien lo haga feliz y lo ame con la misma intensidad que yo, que no se ahorre sus sentimientos como yo lo hice por miedo y logre lo que yo no pude, que cumpla todas sus metas y se convierta en un hombre exitoso, mientras yo sigo aquí esperando que me llame algún día, sigo aqui deseando ser especial.

Thành Nguyễn	"the song is just literally awesome.
it fits multiple scenarios and settings. for example, being the third wheel in a man-woman relationship, being a son/daughter that is less concerned or having no place in a family, or to simplify, being nothing or irrelevant. 
that's it... you get the idea."
Nerdy_Jeffery	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy

The Holy Virgin	I remember listening to this a few years ago, at the lowest fucking point of my life. And i started crying. Knowing someone else feeling like I do and understanding how it's like made me feel less lonely in that mindset. You're not alone! It gets better! If I can get better, so can you. Believe me.

We probably needed some help don't he so inconsiderate. Always be thankful I wish I was I loose everything in the end but my sanity. God put it on my heart I would die before he let that happen.

Switchblade800x	I heard that song for the first time due to a women on the psychiatric ward. I know emo rock and emocore and so of that stuff but that song is beyond a depressive song, once you listen to it makes you feel like you want to hang yourself... I think they must ban this song.
Yayaa Cobain	Cette chanson est douce et rugueuse à la fois, elle me donne envie de fondre en larme et de sauter de joie, une de mes préférées sans hésiter. C'est un pur bonheur de l'écouter.

Brian Finch	I've always loved hard house. The harder the better. But if I heard this live in any punk rocker bar I would hit the mosh pit like a tornado. This is an epic song and a personal favourite. I went to a punk bar once and they didn't give a shit about anything I loved it. Maybe I was in the wrong music genre. But loved house music and spent many weekends dancing forgetting the crap in the world. Any music that can do that is worth a listen.

chrom6419	"Thom Yorke napisał ""Creep"" w późnych latach 80., gdy studiował na University of Exeter. Według Jonny'ego Greenwooda została napisana z myślą o dziewczynie, za którą Yorke szalał, i która niespodziewanie pojawiła się na jednym z koncertów On a Friday (jak pierwotnie nazywał się zespół). Według Yorke'a opowiada o niepewnościach związanych z byciem mężczyzną w dzisiejszych czasach."

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Same stalking me maybe jeleous and turns to murder.. abuse and i dont even know this person..    same same im  think understood that an incident in regards to a person somewhere acted out on me but it was maybe same. And i got hit by a sucker punch as result of paranoid insecurites of not me. of a persons. acting out. one of them has no bussiness in mylife and the ohter has no bussiness in my life without no regard or insult . as result of the punk i left. he wanted someone else to fuck up me. i have nothing to do with trash  games immarture people and being stalked bysome twisted asshole fucking up .. and gettting lots .t hen the other creep acts out and gets paranoid but his getting judgement and then the other one is  larger one , and they want him to fuck up someone and he hit me with a sucker punch im thinking that the hit had to do with his fears paranoia of someone having nothing to do withhim in all self resepct of not in that mode doing me and he wanted to show off and really fuck up someone. bad. he then ahd choice to keep fucking up or to correct it but blamed a dying victim which is me. story. dragging a dying person from his punch into his web and trash me and then trasg me more becuase i was not even abel to control what was going on and became a puppet in a game for some puns a game i was to smart for then left dying on street of nyc where i struggle to get medical care and a family abuse me same.  unti it killed me. people are fuck up.. beware of creeps..

Rayburn58	Radiohead is another example of how art in music has declined since MTV and then rap/hip hop took over. Young people today are conditioned to accept poorly manufactured and simplistic unorchestrated so called music. rap and hip hop is the ultimate example of this. The great bands and artists orchestrated great sounds in a wide variety of ways using complex interweaving harmonies, melodies, and vocals along with a very wide range of conventional and unconventional musical instruments. Listen to Elton John, Moody Blues, Steely Dan, Beach boys Pet Sounds album. And of course the Beatles.

Evan	"Acts 10:34-43

34 So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, 35 but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. 36 As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), 37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. 

39 And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, 40 but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, 41 not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. 43 To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”"
Luka Aniguen	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Elsass in Texas	The song of my high school years, was perfectly putting words in a tough phase in my life. A time of soul-searching, of love-seeking.
ROOKTABULA	Just like Blur with Song 2: This was just a fukkaround, Seattle Sound piss take in the studio and just like Blur, the _gag_ became their biggest hit. Weird synchronicity there

Amit Zalle	"Creep/ Radiohead - lyrics

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

하늘	"""I wish I was special."" It is just the same w/ my current situation. I thought I was sepcial when I was a kid. I thought I was kind of smart during middle school. I realized I am not. I realized that there are  a lot of smarter students than me. And my last thought was I am still somewhat special 'cuz I thinks this way. But it is nor as well. I learned that almost everyone thinks like this by defaming one's self-esteem. I tried to make effort for academic achievement and I thought I did enough. But it was not. My effort is not effort of others. I am fuxxin' dumb. I am merely one of the guys over the world. I'm not special at all.

What've I done? I was obsessed with ridiculous pride that I will succeed, I will be good at it, I am different from those normal guys, and these kinds of fuxxin' bullshit.

Then did I do something? NO. I am just those impatient and lazy, normal guys who procrastinate and do not make enough effort.

 What did I do? NOTHING.
I am not FUXXIN' special"

Donna Petraglia	A little insight from a 65 year old lady who grew up listening to some great music in the seventies. I heard this song sitting in traffic today, I’ve heard it before. But today I listened to the words and thought about every “creep”, lost soul or narcissist I’ve ever know, male or female that have made my skin crawl lol. . I have enough thoughts about myself but this just brings the creeps to mind. Great song.

JoJo Jr	"""I don't belong here"" 🙂"
Synergy Speaks	"Anyone else here look back at their teenage years and imagine themselves in the same position as the songwriter?
I think that todays ‘incels’ could possibly relate in a similar way. Its perhaps reassuring to know that there are others who felt the same way before this social group were defined, and perhaps there is something to learn from that timeless attribute of younger men having that sense of insecurity, especially since most will grow out of it at some point."

Sociovaria	When I was a junior in high school back in 2006, the first person I ever fell in love with got killed in a car accident the week before prom. This was the song that to this day 16 years later is set as their MySpace profile song, and I guess as long as the internet exists it always will be. This will always be a special song to me, and it'll always just make me think of the good ole days.

laloy abragan	Ify, i lost my little brother before we became closer. I used to bully him when we were kids. I was 4 y/o back then and he was 3 i couldn't understand when he died. I just thought that he will comeback but that made me realize how bad i was before and i regret. We both diagnosed with dengue fever. We were hospitalized but  we are not in the same hospital. I survived the dengue fever but he didnt. It is sad that i wasn't in his last moments

just me with my foot in my mouth	"I don’t care how “overrated” this song is it’s absolutely fantastic

Edit: because of replies I’m getting I wanna clarify that I don’t think this song is overrated but I know a lot of people that do and there are plenty that will tell you it’s overplayed and over popularized but that doesn’t mean I agree"

Stormy Weather	"Busted. I know just where u (or whoever those 6 guys listed)  stole this beautiful Melody from. 
Air Supply.
 'All I Need is the Air That I Breathe '
Your band is awful. Especially the drums .
And whoever wrote that line  
'what the hell am I doing here'  
could have easily improved it 90°|°
by merely saying ,
' Why am I here' , or maybe 'why the hek am I here? '.
There's another old hit in the last half I have not yet I. D. 'd."
Maritza Silva	Fantásticos los guitarristas también lo dan todo 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
rotten_girl	I remember the prettiest girl in my class, blonde, curly hair, honey like eyes, flawless skin, charming smile, liked by everyone, singing this song in the front of the class during English class, at first I didn't get why someone like her would sing this song... Turns out her step father raped her, beated her and verbally insulted her everyday... Her mom knew what was happening but did nothing, neither did we in the class as we thought she just wanted attention by singing this song. Now she's still alive, but in a really bad mental state.

Blingbling Boy	this was my best friend’s song before they passed. i knew them since i was two. they used to sing this all the time, pain in their voice. through cancer she stayed strong, but it wasn’t enough. i thank radiohead for giving them hope through their disease and a way to cope. i miss my friend everyday. when this song plays, i violently cry. the tears come out so hard, sometimes, blood pours out. i can still hear her whispers singing along. goodbye, sophia. fly high.
Roy cat	Cheers brothers n sisters 🍻🥂
Cheryl Klaver	We’ve all been the Creep...that’s why this song still rocks. Truth in music...doesn’t get much better than this.

варона	Спасибо. Что напомнили!!!
Machanoid cluster	"I don't know if I like this song or not, because i really don't like being a creep, some weird or a depressed guy.
       I really do want to change or be a better person...but currently I'm being hunted by mental disturbance...
       I do myself know that I'm a very introverted person..
It's not that I hadn't any opportunities to interact with people but it's more like even if I make friends, in latter stage its fall apart because all i see, they like using me or   suck there dìck.
       So in latter stage i end up arguing with friends because I don't feel like being used or being dominated by others. All because of this I have developed a pessimistic mindset and it's now a habits for me.
       But do i really being like this? No.. i really don't.
Do you think this weird guy had any dramatic love story...? Yes I do offcourse.... 
       Because of my situations sometime i Lough loud like a person who lost his mental stability.
      I really want to keep write and express more but sorry I already spent an hour or so...
      Lastly, as an opinion i would like to say don't be a creep, a weirdo, introvert or a very depressed person. And  for me stay away from over depressive musics or don't listen too much. But I know all have own  interests.
         Anyway thank you for reading......"

Junior	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo

I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Damned One	I love this song so much bc It resonates 💯 plus it’s sadly hauntingly beautiful. I always say how EVERY time I listen to this song it’s like I’m still hearing it for the very first time in the 90’s, my epic era! It never gets old and most of all it reminds me of how I, and I know many, have felt or are currently feeling in life.  It’s an anthem or constant reminder to myself how grateful I am to still be here, EVERYDAY is a blessing.🙏🏽

Trip by Parokya ni Edgar

'Pag nasa Shaolin House
Nauubos ang pera ko
Sa 'king kaka-order
Ng bola-bola't asado


Kahit anong flavor
Pusa man o aso
Basta't siopao na special
It's so very special


Ito ang trip
Ito ang gusto ko
That is why I'm always here
'Cause I do belong here


Sa siopao na 'to
Naempacho yata ako
Ang aking nakain
Ay lampas labing-walo


I want you to know that
Paborito ko talaga
Ang siopao na special
It's so very special


Ito ang trip
Ito ang gusto ko
That is why I'm always here
'Cause I do belong here


Pero, pero
Minsan ay nababadtrip din ako
Kapag ang siopao ko'y
Walang, walang, walang
Walang laman, walang laman
Walang laman, walang laman


Pero kahit ganito
Bumibili pa rin ako
Ng siopao na special
It's so very special


Ito ang trip..."

Dr Tim O'Shea	In 92 it was the quintessential expression of teen angst, hopelessness,  and alienation.  Today it says  the same  thing   - for all of us, as we witness the annihilation of our culture.  With our permission.  .

Gitar Dersi	"12 mart 2022 saat 00.53
yıl 2000 civarları. Bi grubumuz var yeni. yeni sahneye çıkan bir grubuz. Vokalisti gruptan çıkarttık yeni bir vokalist arıyoruz ve bu parçayı hakkıyla söyleyen bi adam bulamıyoruz. en az 5 6 adam denedik yok. Nakaratta hepsi sıçıyor. Neyse bi eleman geldi şişman, kısa boylu, sarışın, mavi gözlü, elma yanaklı ve kepçe kulaklı. Tam bir çizgi film karakteri (keşke adını hatırlasam) Neyse geldi provaya sahneyi çok iyi hatırlıyorum, tek eli cebinde başladı söylemeye. Ulan bir yükselişler bir çıkışlar. Biz çalarken birbirimize sırıtıyoruz arkadaşlarla bu nasıl olabilir diye. En beklemediğimiz tip hayvan gibi vokal yapıyor. Bu arada Creep söylemesi cidden çok zor bi parça kankiler. Derken diğer parçalarda da çok iyi. Neyse adamda hiç frontman görüntüsü yok ama alıcaz dedik gruba yapıcak bişey yok. Taksim ex-bronx ve Gitar bar'da 1 yıl sahne yaptık elemanla. Cidden izleyenler çocuğa viski falan ısmarlıyodu şarkı aralarında (pavyonda değilsen pek rastlanır bi durum değildir)
Neyse sonra bi gün çocuk dedi abi benim iş güç kovalamam lazım müziğe zaman ayıramıcam. Dedik sağlık olsun, ayrıldık. Sonra yeni vokal aramalar. O da belki başka bi şarkının altına artık..."

KalimbaSax	A select people in our jazz band played this song, with my friend as the vocalist. Today was the first concert we had, and the first time I got to hear this piece and hear my friend sing. He sounded amazing. I wish i could hear him sing the whole song, as when the other players came in i couldnt hear him. That's what led me here, and honestly i really like this song, even kinda relate to it. Evem though you weren't the one who suggested it, thanks for introducing me to a great song with your amazing voice :3
Dana McC	i want to have control!

Amy Wade	Good song. It makes me think of how the Beast feels meeting Beauty. It's sweet. If a woman feels like a creep, it's just terribly sad. Something went badly wrong.  No woman should be told she's a creep. It's like you want to tear down all of creation or something.  Pull the petals off a flower.

verycherry	This song has a naked honesty about it.
verycherry	"My best friend died who was 11 years younger than me.  Most days I'm fine but today was the 4 month mark.  He died on his 36th birthday of a sudden heart attack out of nowhere after Covid.  He was a genius and was always helping people and loved all living things.  I miss our talks we had almost daily.  He mentored at risk youth, medical students, rescued animals, did genetic research and was running for political office.  I could see him becoming President one day with all his innovative ideas.  He was young enough to have a family if he wanted to.  I'm older and not as healthy or as much of a genius and so when it hit me that it was the 4 month mark today this song popped in my head when I wondered ""what the hell am I doing here?""

I wondered why God took someone so accomplished with so much potential and unselfish goals with so much more to give and left me here instead.  I had to wonder why.  I know that sometimes things don't always make sense to us and I will find my greater purpose.  Perhaps I will find out that he is stronger and able to help direct people to discoveries better from where he is than he could ever do here.  Maybe I won't know until I pass too.

Well, now that I cried and got that out of the way, this song is just as good as it was in my  junior year of high school. 

Some of the music nowadays doesn't have the same feel and depth with the emphasis on synthesizer rather than actual instruments and electronically enhanced voices.

This just has a naked honesty about it.

Every time I see him I feel my tummy warm up, his smile makes me question if he's a human, he's too perfect to be real, but then I remember that he doesn't love me, and it's devastating to me.
I love you so much boy it makes me happy, you are very special, you came at the worst time and turned it into a good one.
You live in my heart <3.💚"

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?

Joel GoodGuy	"It's been 28 or 29 years!!! I was 15 yo when I bumped into them (Radiohead)  on the TV  for the first time and it was with this very same video on State Television system called  Imevision  (Mexican Television Institute) which had been sold to a Mexican millonaire (Ricardo Salinas) and all of a sudden that newly privatized TV station was testing their broadcast signal with random music videos in Spanish, French and English at different hours day and night.
One day in the afternoon I had just gotten back home from  Highschool and I was in my room lying on my old coach with the TV on Imevision old channels/signals just waitng for the music videos to start, they had the color bars screen tests going on both channels  (13 & 7) and all of a sudden Radiohead appears  on the screen with this video, I just went ecstatic  and couldn´t believe what I seeing  and hearing (I already spoke, read and understood English since I always attended bilingual schools since Kindergarten) I started shouting for my brothers to come and watch and listen to this; when they finally heard me and got to my room the video was over and they asked ""whats up with your shouting?"" and when I was trying to explain to them what I had just seen on the new TV channels, all of a sudden the TV channel just repeated the video!!!! 
And as soon as my twin and younger brother heard the first line of the song they also  went astonished!!!!
Four months later we got Pablo Honey cassette tape from The UK, it cost $140 pesos ($34 US dollars of that time).
Gosh it seems llike it was just yesterday!!!!"

Carole H	This song is the most powerfully emotive song I have ever heard . Pure and utterly genius . And when u create something like this a band can think its commercialised and hate it. No it is just pure genius in its way of reaching out to people in their basic human needs and their darkest hours . There is a difference . It reaches out to the majority not with a catchy mindless tune for a Saturday night party.  But because all m humans have this  basic need to be wanted and loved
Katerin Brigith Flores Pasache	:(

Elsa_Blurryface	"*LYRICS:*

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Rosa Melano	"Un comentario más entre todos:') pero al escuchar esta canción me hace acordar a que tan mierda fui con alguien que realmente me amaba:') 
Era un noviazgo de colegio, yo era nuevo en ese colegio y estaba feliz por que tenía nuevos compañeros, usaba muletas en ese entonces por que me había lastimado una pierna, los primeros momentos no me fijaba en ella, luego de un par de semanas formamos un grupo de 5 integrantes y eramos como hermanos, hacíamos toda cosa juntos no nos separabamos siempre estábamos tan unidos.
Al pasar los meses me fui enamorando de una chica que era de mi grupo, me gustaba bastante, nos besabamos sin ser novios, nos abrazabamos y no se sentía de amigos:') 
Luego de un par de meses me decidí me arme de valor y le dije todo lo que sentía por ella y le pedí que sea mi polola:') y acepto, fui el wey más feliz en ese entonces.
Siempre estábamos felices cuando estábamos todos reunidos, se sentía tan especial estar con ellos, hasta que luego una de nuestro grupo se alejo pero de hecho no cuadraba tanto con nosotros y quedamos 4, luego la otra chica se empezó a alejar también y sentí que se estaba yendo todo a la m***** hasta que solo quedamos los 3 y la vrdd ya no se sentía igual:( luego de un par de meses la chica decidió volver a nuestro Grupo y se sentía tan especial todo otv:) 
Luego cuando empezó la pandemia dejamos de ir al colegio:( ya no nos veíamos, excepto yo con mi ex polola pq iba a su casa cada finde:') y fue en esos tiempos donde no se que me paso:') cambie bastante a tal Punto de que ella llegara a bajar tanto de peso que hasta ya no parecía ella:'( luego de igual forma no cambiaba yo:( y siempre hacia caso a los concejos machistas que me daba mi papá:( y fue que por eso llegué a confundir bastantes cosas,(que hasta yo hoy día no se como pude llegar a ser así con alguien que realmente me amaba)
Tuve bastantes problemas con sus padres por como la trataba hasta que llego un día que peleamos nuevamente y la agarre del brazo y ella se levantó y se encerró en su habitación pero cerró la puerta bastante fuerte que su mamá llego:( y no zupe que hacer y decidí irme, luego a un par de semanas volvímos a hablar y trate de que ella volviera a ser igual de antes conmigo pero no se que pasaba, ella ya no era la misma:( hasta que fui por última vez a llevarle un obsequio y fue la última vez que fui a su casa:( 
A veces desearía no haber escuchado los consejos de mi padre, que por ello llegue a confundir bastantes cosas y que conllevó a que la hermosa relación que llevábamos fuese un asco:( 
Hoy día ya no nos hablamos y tampoco nos juntamos con nuestro grupo:( pero una amiga esta queriendo reunir nuevamente el grupo:') ojalá que pase eso y pues eso es todo:')"

Elgalan90	Sometimes I think that one should not suffer for another person, sometimes I think that because one has to cry and think so much about someone who does not love me, who does not feel love for me, I have fought for their love, but it has always been impossible, sometimes I would like to go very far that no one finds me and cry in the midst of my loneliness,  no woman falls in love with me, I feel like a monster, I feel like garbage.

garfield kart fani	This was my older sharts's favorite song, he was very introverted and pretty depressed. When he'd sing along you could really feel he felt this way. He died 9 years ago of a heart attack at 20 from an undiagnosed heart condition. His heart was literally 2.5x the size it should've been. He was the smartest, sweetest, most genuine person I've ever had the pleasure knowing. I ruined our relationship with my choices a few years before he passed. To get closure I dove Into all of his interests and favorite bands. Almost a decade later this song makes me bawl, I hear his voice when I hear this song. You weren't a creep Seth, and you belonged here, you deserved happiness and I'm so sorry I couldn't be closer with you before you died. Love and miss you everyday...

•The Girl Next Door•	I often felt exactly what this song expresses in many social situations and social circles, I always felt like the outsider no matter what, I never felt like I belonged. And I still do. I just hope one day I might find someone or somewhere I feel like I can belong, it’s been very lonely like this.
Jaymes Main	I don't know much about your band the song creep I don't know really what you think about it but one of my friends that's gone now her name is Kathy and I really miss her but she really liked this song a lot and I never I never listen to the studio version because she was always singing it but I never heard you guys cuss but when I heard this live one right now really brought a lot of intuition out there but keep jamming guys

Inner System Inbound	This is a shame because the word “creep” is actually an offensive term toward Germans. Their smaller stature allowed them to move around quickly and silently during WWII, and their term for their build was “Crēopan”, eventually being reduced to “creeps” by American soldiers. It’s basically the N-word for German pedestrians.

Manda Pulido	this was my favorite song on Rock Band when I was a kid and it’s still a favorite song now.
Julieta Sáenz	gooood
flower child	One of the reasons this song stands the test of time is because of how the lyrics resonates with everyone. Everyone, no matter who or where, has at some point, been in a bad place and felt like they weren’t good enough for people or the world around them and that they felt like an alien existing around everyone else. Everyone has felt like a creep at some point.

AND I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here, I don't belong here. Exactly. I wanted a perfect soul, a perfect body, keep control, I wanted to be perfect, but why, I can't? I didn't find that out... This song always calms me down...
Wilfredo Rojas	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

Artimadeco muebles	caciones como esta , siempre me acordaran de ti mi amigo  vuela muy alto siempre te voy a querer
Hurst Family	One of the best songs from beginning to end ever made!!!
George C	I remember when i was a kid that i was afraid to even go outside because of the tremendous fear of what others would think about me, and i would play and be certain of the scenarios i had in my head, that every one would hate me because of the way i looked ( very hairy as a 10 yr old, i literaly had a beard and hair all over my body) + beeing overweight. This song speaks to the uncertain kid i used to be, it does bring memories back, but TODAY i'm at the opposite part of this song's meanings. It's all about assuming and pursuing what you want. Hard work that eventually pays of.
Bloody Nuggets	I like the among us version better
Jayden Barefoot	2022 anyone here
Milton Junior	I’m a creep. Or maybe others are.

Eleonova1976	Yup.😳
Alejandro Shonenbat	"Todos los jóvenes adolescentes en crecimiento deberían escuchar este tipo de música, te hace transportar a un punto de introspección profundo, uno mismo se cuestiona y se posiciona en un lugar incómodo del pensamiento, pero una vez que logras salir te das cuenta que la vida tiene mucho que ofrecerte, una motivación que es motor de vida, combustible para vivir.
Crecer es un proceso, cuestionarse la vida también, sobretodo en un mundo donde te prima el aspecto superficial, lo cual no tiene nada de malo, pero antes es necesario ser bello de adentro, crecer y experimentar."
028_ Rio Hindami	mancing mania
Hélène Delvert	Et bien je connais la chanson par cœur vive Radiohead 🎇🎇

15 years after it's release, is when this song had an impact in my life. Rock Band! Every week I'd rock out with my buddies (our band) and sing this song.  To this day, I tell everyone the tale of how I got 100% singing this song on Expert. I fuckin' love this song."

Elvira Castillo	"Reminds me of my friend Lupee and i sitting on her porch with a  bottle of Jack.  She'd just gotten back from Mexico.  She went to make up with her mom whome she was upset with for finding a new man. Her dad had divorced and remarried but  for some reason was upset her mom found someone. Well she gets to Mexico to her mom's a day after her mom passed from natural causes. 
We played that song over and over. 
My friend found love years later. I lost track of her,, us. 
I found her on fBup 22 years later. She had gotten married and they had 6 kids. 
We met up 2 years later. in Vegas.  She told me her hubby walked out after baby number 6 wasnt even a year old. Just disappeared.  Coward!! We spoke for like an hour, i was there for personal stuff and had to go. I dont like Vegas but would definitely go back to chill with my beloved friend. 
We made plans id go back and take my son so our kids could hang out and become friends. Two months later her first grand baby was born. Four days later my beloved friend passed away from brain cancer complications.  
I miss you Lupee 🌼🌷🌼🌻"

Yuno le yoyo	Je me reconnais énormément dans cette chanson, ça m’apaise de l’écouter
Ok Buddy	I understand the message, but at the same time i dont advocate the message. It is a difficult one, that many think they can relate to. But this here is a song created by famous, rich, succesful people feeling miserable, that is addressed to poor, non-succesful, but equally miserable people. The authors have no idea what does it feel like for the many recipients. This is what makes the song dangerous. Btw at the end i've got a Gilette ad about being manly. LMAO
Star0210	I love ❤ everything about this song. . Heard it first years ago in movie SFW  🎥 1994.
Laurent Penot	"Sent the version with French translation rolling, to my future ex wife for saint valentine's 22 😓 She said it made her heart ""vibrate""... really special 🥺👏🏻"

Jas Bataille	"In the industry, the story goes like this : 5 real, total weirdos have just been signed. Nobody knows what to expect from those kids. They don't really speak. No one knows if they're high or not. Everyone is on edge : the label spent a lot of money. They came in the studio with cheap instruments, set up just as usual as if they were in a club. Then the leader said : ""Hum... can we record now?"" And this was their first take. No one knew what the song was before that. Everyone went up in the studio and applaud."

AW AV	"I loved how everything builds up to crescendo , tensed n slow down to calm,to all the ""creeps, weirdos"" , listen,you are loved n valued. God loves you all"
Brad Thompson	Poof 600 thousand lives and 700 thousand wounded in a labor-based economy and none of the professor or media is talking about it. I wonder what that does to nation that is already divided? Then after working on southern reconstruction a depression hit. Those moms, dads, wounded are really about it now! We continue to progress as a nation and hen a pandemic hits Protests in the streets break out and tear more of statues. They are all about racism. The conversation continues on about 300 years of slavery in America. What are even doing? They must mean wealth inequality and equal opportunity. We are pretty good at equal opportunity, but no the wealth disparity so much. I wonder the Egyptian Pharoh's not Pharah's were thinking when they probably used slaves to construct large pyramid tombs (Laborers for God). Oh yeah, I am God! Now a days we call it Meta or something else. Do it a bit more ethical, bust similar principles apply.

mersudredi	hace unos años a mi mamá le gustaba poner este tipo de música y siempre tenia que sonar la de creep, la verdad no le prestaba atención y casi siempre que sonaba esta canción mi mama dejaba lo que estaba haciendo y se ponia a cantarla xd, luego de un tiempo de tanto ponerla me empezó a gustar, pero no me encontraba ese tono triste ni nada de eso, solo me gustaba. hace 2 años que pongo esta canción por mi cuenta porque le habia encontrado ese tono melancolico y tmb porque me identificaba con la letra, es lo que lo vuelve más triste.

Im no longer with them because they grew out of the town and went to pursue their dreams.

I felt i stayed behind, and deep down now a days i know everything im living thru today i got it well deserved.

Ryszard Stychno	"Wspólne wartości…..dla całej ludzkości…..

Dla wierzących i niewierzących…..najważniejsze…..z dekalogu….. są trzy przykazania
…..5 nie zabijaj…..odwrotnością jest ……zabijaj jak chcesz…..
…..6 nie cudzołóż….odwrotnością jest …..ruchaj jak chcesz…..
…..7 nie kradnij…..odwrotnością jest …..kradnij jak chcesz…..
W dzisiejszych czasach…..gdzie jako najważniejsze wartości stawia się…..seks i pieniądze….osoba żyjąca…..przyjmuje odwrotność tych przykazań…..
Wzór na duszę ……wyraża się wzorem ciśnienia……czyli….. p = F / S czyli ciśnienie jest równe sile dzielonej przez pole powierzchni…..we wzorze na duszę siła oznacza przestrzeganie przykazań…..moralność człowieka…..a pole powierzchni oznacz ciało człowieka…..
Im wyższa moralność …..tym wyższe ciśnienie…..a jak człowiek nie ma moralności…..tylko ważnie jest ciało…..to nie ma ciśnienia…..
Dlatego aby ludzkość miała wspólny mianownik…..powinna przestrzegać tych trzech przykazań…......"

Joao Francisco	"Quando você esteve aqui
Não conseguia te olhar nos olhos
Você é como um anjo
Sua pele me faz chorar

Você flutua como uma pena
Em um mundo tão belo
Eu queria ser especial
Você é especial pra caralho

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar

Eu não ligo se isso machuca
Eu quero ter o controle
Eu quero um corpo perfeito
Eu quero uma alma perfeita

Eu quero que você perceba
Quando eu não estiver por perto
Que você é especial pra caralho
Eu queria ser especial

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar

Ela está fugindo pela porta
Ela está fugindo
Ela corre, corre, corre, corre
Corre

Seja lá o que te faz feliz
Seja lá o que você deseje
Você é especial pra caralho
Eu queria ser especial

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar
Eu não pertenço a este lugar"
w23	90's Ed Sheeran
El Anderson シ	Amigos mi novia me fue infiel .... me lo confeso ella misma ... la conocí hace un año  unos días antes de mi cumpleaños ella vino a mi vida cuando mas necesitaba a alguien y hace unos días fue mi cumple ... y pues me dejo casi un año exacto dejándome solo y pues me duele mucho que ella  tire  a la basura nuestra amistad  por alguien que conoció en un viaje hace unas semanas atras ...  , fuimos amigos luego de meses decidimos ser pareja ... bueno al caso ahora no se que hacer esta es la 4ta vez que me hacen lo mismo ...... me  ilusionan me prometen cosas lindas dicen que soy único para ella y al final me rompen el corazón de una manera horrible , solo tuve una pareja que si me amaba que era la indicada era perfecta y esa fue mi primera pareja pero nos separamos porque sus padres no estaban deacuerdo con la relacion luego de ella solo encontré tristeza y no estoy exagerando es como si mi única oportunidad de ser feliz se hubiese ido , tan solo quiero ser feliz con alguien que si me ame pero ahora tengo miedo de que alguien me ilusione muy bonito y al final me haga sentir como el tonto del año , no se que hice mal .... le di  cariño , comprensión le di todo de mi y aun si no fue suficiente . Esta canción se la dedique a ella y muchas mas canciones que son parte importante de mi  pero bueno ojala nunca les pase lo que me paso a mi y aunque alguien les haga daño sigan siendo esa persona única cariñosa y encantadora , no dejen que  alguien les haga cambiar<3

아비갤 Abigael	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

Barbara McCroy	I think of  Harriet Tubman when I hear this song because she didn’t want to be special she just wanted to fit  in and have her own sense of freedom and a  life and yet she did better than fit in and felt her freedom she that wasn’t enough she saved so many enslaved African Americans because she wanted to share that with others so they could feel the sweet fruits of freedom. She wanted control of her own freedom to only make things right firmer  African ‘Americans brothers and sisters I believe she is the most beautiful person and spirit in the history of our country.“♥️✌️😔......🦋

Okabe Rintaro	I hate this song like radiohead members do: it doesn't represent radiohead music at all, they ivolved into great alt- Rock and art-Rock and people in comment section didn't even listen to albums like kid a, ok computer, in rainbows, a moon shaped pool which are Master pieces musically, but this song is a piece of generic grange. They have huge and various discography. It's sad. But i gotta appreciate Johnny greenwood's work here, that solo is cool imo

Nora Sanchez	Una vez iba con mi papá en el carro y estábamos escuchando la radio, cuando empieza a sonar esa canción, ambos empezamos a cantar, fue un momento muy lindo la verdad, estaba muy feliz. Mi papá falleció hace 8 meses, y ahora que escucho esa canción se me viene a la mente ese recuerdo con mi papá y me hace sentir muy triste y sola, porque quiera volver a ese momento y disfrutar aun más su compañía, pero bueno no se puede regresar el tiempo. Es por eso que a esa canción le tengo un sentimiento de felicidad, tristeza y nostalgia.

Cold Beer	This song reminds me of my awkwardness as I secretly crushed on girls in my classes over the years.  I was so afraid they wouldn't like me back, so I just stayed shut in.  It's a prison you never escape, decades later, I still see and feel the bars and those girls remain angels in my mind.

Nope, You Hate Yourself.
You cringe every time you look in the mirror. If it's not your physical appearance upsetting you, it's your emotional disposition. But there's absolutely no reason to hate yourself. Whatever you don't like about yourself, it's entirely in your power to change it. And you should probably get on that. It's you who you're stuck with for the rest of your life."

elton ketchup	Is it unrealistic to accept the resurrection as a fact? No, for Jesus taught that someday “all those in the memorial tombs” will be resurrected. (John 5:28) Jehovah is the Creator of all life. Should it be hard to believe that he can re-create life? Of course, much would depend on Jehovah’s memory. Can he remember our dead loved ones? Countless trillions of stars fill the universe, yet God knows the name of each one! (Isaiah 40:26) So Jehovah God can remember our dead loved ones in every detail, and he is ready to restore them to life.

Weird-Man	Music from the 90's-early2000's was the reason I had zero interest in music when growing up. I never understood why people liked music. I just didn't get it. I thought it sounded terrible. Then in 2008, when I was 13 years old, I was introduced to 1920's-1950's music and a passion inside me sparked. Radiohead just isn't for me, but Bob Crosby on the other hand...

Me gustaría tener todo para que te quedes por siempre.
Sos la primera persona que amo, y me da tanto miedo sentirme así, haberte mostrado éste lado mío y que al final sea todo al pedo. Sé que no vas a leer esto nunca, pero sos especial, sos totalmente especial y yo simplemente soy patética. Ojalá lo nuestro dure por siempre, pero sino, voy a entender que te quieras alejar. Te adoro y aprecio."

manuel neyvor	"""A quien importe""
 Llevar una cruz en el craneo, el entrecejo.
Sobre el corazon, el esternon, en el pecho.
Valiendo nada, sin importe, sin derecho.
Nacer, amar, reproducirse sin heredero.
Transitar avenidas, ir a la escuela, marcado por muerto.
Sin nombre ni apellido que valga o cuente ¡ Ni un peso !
Pasar el dia viviendo para otros, 
sin agenda, fiesta, feria. ¡ Eso !
Dando ""rienda suelta"" al dolor de esclavo, 
impuesto asi porque si, por el patronato.
Toda una vida sin valer un centavo.
Ni un beso fraterno un: "" adios hermano"".
En total agiotizado despecho ¡ Despecho !
Sin importar mi risa, mi llanto.¡ Brindo por eso !.

I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell I'm doing here encapsulate a type of discomfort every human who has ever been and every human who will ever be will go through.

ズレテルリズム	"[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special


[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"
Rita Taca	Love  you creep 2022
nichole laskowski	"this song brought me down 
(I wanna have control)
and it got me right back 
because it embraces being ""weird"" , 

So even if this wasn't the intention of the writers, this is what resonates with us. We needed to hear that it's ok to be weird,  that we can lose control, but the music tells us, with the shift from an accidental chord strike to a beautiful chorus, that we can admit we're ""weird"" 

merci"

Jennifer	Poor Thom, I totally get it being frustrated by this song literally overshadowing all of the other great hits. While I did love this song when I heard it at 13, when I bought the album my two favorites were You and Anyone can play guitar.   Then the bends became my next favorite album and while I love the album as a whole. “Bullet proof … I wish I was” is my most fave on it. But then the list goes on with all the other hits. Reckoner, let down….. and I was so stoked to hear Exit Music instrumental being played in an episode of Westworld on HBO ♥️

Mary Ellen Gilvey	My cyberbullyier put this on my car radio to apologize to me for what he did to me on my birthday by shoving porn girls morning noon and night on my Facebook because 3 days before my birthday I didn't say YES to marry him as he was hovering in his helicopter outside my window at 4:15am so 3 days later he shoved porn girls all day on my birthday.  A week later I was driving in NYC having fun and there he is again hovering above me in his helicopter and he put this song on the radio to tell me (he's a creep) and that he was sorry for doing that to me on my birthday.

Taci Martins	"Quando você esteve aqui antes

Nem pude te olhar nos olhos

Você é como um anjo

Sua pele me faz chorar

Você flutua como pluma

Num mundo perfeito

Eu queria ser especial

Você é especial pra caralho



Mas eu sou uma aberração, um esquisito

Que diabos é que eu estou fazendo aqui

Este não é meu lugar



Não me importa se vai doer

Quero ter o controle (da situação)

Quero um corpo perfeito

Uma alma perfeita

Quero que você perceba

Quando eu não estou por perto

Você é especial pra caralho

Eu queria ser especial



Mas eu sou uma aberração, um esquisito

Que diabos é que eu estou fazendo aqui

Este não é meu lugar



Ela está indo embora de novo

Esta fugindo

Ela foge, foge, foge, foge, foge



O que você quiser para te fazer feliz

O que você quiser

Você é especial pra caralho

Eu queria ser especial



Mas eu sou uma aberração, um esquisito

Que diabos é que eu estou fazendo aqui

Este não é meu lugar

Este não é meu lugar

Creep

When you were here before,

Couldn't look you in the eye.

You're just like an angel,

Your skin makes me cry.

You float like a feather,

In a beautiful world

I wish I was special,

You're so fucking special.



But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here.



I don't care if it hurts,

I wanna have control.

I want a perfect body,

I want a perfect soul.

I want you to notice,

When I'm not around.

You're so fucking special,

I wish I was special."

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Gp McIvor	"Fun fact for those that don’t get the lyrics and songs intentions:

Singer Thom Yorke wrote ""Creep"" while studying at Exeter University in the late 1980s. Yorke said: ""I wasn't very happy with the lyrics; I thought they were pretty crap.""Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said they were inspired by a girl that Yorke had followed around and who unexpectedly attended a Radiohead performance. John Harris, then the Oxford correspondent for Melody Maker, said ""Creep"" was about a girl who frequented the upmarket Little Clarendon Street in Oxford. 

According to Harris, Yorke preferred the more bohemian Jericho, and expressed his discomfort with the lines ""What the hell am I doing here / I don't belong here"".

Asked about ""Creep"" in 1993, Yorke said: ""I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: to assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it. “Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about ""recognising what you are""."

When you were here before

Konnte dir nicht in die Augen sehen
Couldn't look you in the eye

Du bist wie ein Engel
You're just like an angel

Deine Haut bringt mich zum weinen
Your skin makes me cry

du schwebst wie eine Feder
You float like a feather

In einer schönen Welt
In a beautiful world

Ich wünschte, ich wäre besonders
I wish I was special

Du bist so verdammt besonders
You're so fuckin' special

Aber ich bin ein gruseliger Typ
But I'm a creep

Ich bin ein Sonderling
I'm a weirdo

Was zum Teufel mache ich hier?
What the hell am I doin' here?

Ich gehöre nicht hierher
I don't belong here

Es ist mir egal, ob es wehtut
I don't care if it hurts

Ich will die Kontrolle haben
I wanna have control

Ich will einen perfekten Körper
I want a perfect body

Ich will eine perfekte Seele
I want a perfect soul

Ich möchte, dass Sie es bemerken
I want you to notice

Wenn ich nicht da bin
When I'm not around

So verdammt besonders
So fuckin' special

Ich wünschte, ich wäre besonders
I wish I was special

Aber ich bin ein gruseliger Typ
But I'm a creep

Ich bin ein Sonderling
I'm a weirdo

Was zum Teufel mache ich hier?
What the hell am I doin' here?

Ich gehöre nicht hierher
I don't belong here

Sie rennt aus der Tür (rennen)
She's running out the door (run)

Sie läuft aus
She's running out

Sie rennt, rennt, rennt, rennt,
She run, run, run, run,

Lauf...
Run...

Was immer dich glücklich macht
Whatever makes you happy

Irgendwas du willst
Whatever you want

Du bist so verdammt besonders
You're so fuckin' special

Ich wünschte, ich wäre besonders
I wish I was special

Aber ich bin ein gruseliger Typ
But I'm a creep

Ich bin ein Sonderling
I'm a weirdo

Was zum Teufel mache ich hier?
What the hell am I doin' here?

Ich gehöre nicht hierher
I don't belong here

Ich gehöre nicht hierher
I don't belong here"

DPZ TV	Fell in love with this song 16 years ago. My last semester of high school I became deeply infatuated with a classmate of mine, which triggered my first bipolar episode. When I asked her out, she turned me down politely a week later after thinking about it, but my brain couldn't handle it, and I wrote her a letter pouring out my heart and soul to her, which freaked her out, as she bluntly told me at prom. Everything about this song felt right, which was unbelievably cathartic. Nowadays I just love the song for what it is, but I'll always appreciate how it helped me deal with the horrible emotional pain I was feeling at the time.

type	"Lyrics
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

ccatarian	Petrice O'Neal's take on this song is spot on ..
Ayde Rodriguez	Amazing! 😍
Aaron Schwarz	This song rocks / reminds me of being younger when I had more energy & love was new, when I stronger & had more endurance. I used to listen to this song while snowboarding because it hits a special spot deep down & reminds me of failed relationships, a specific ex who really rattled with me repeatedly & then ditched me for a rich guy - she became fat, her worst fear came true & moved to the one city she hated the most, Kent Washington, having been born a diamond tennis bracelet tinker bell themed spoiled rotten girl. I could go on & on, but this music takes me back to time of an emotional rollercoaster that lasted years! Love it!
Hmm Mhru	I'm feeling this more now that I got covid, Weirdly
GoddessPallasAthena	I understand that a lot of Radiohead fans hate this song.  I am not one of them. The melody, that jarring guitar riff, the feeling of self-doubt / self-loathing, the feeling of not being in control of yourself . . . all still classic and relatable.  I get it lacks the innovation of their later songs, but that doesn't stop it from being a great song!

Dani Fla Santos	"Aberração
Quando você esteve aqui
Não conseguia te olhar nos olhos
Você é como um anjo
Sua pele me faz chorar

Você flutua como uma pena
Em um mundo tão belo
Eu queria ser especial
Você é especial pra caralho

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar

Eu não ligo se isso machuca
Eu quero ter o controle
Eu quero um corpo perfeito
Eu quero uma alma perfeita

Eu quero que você perceba
Quando eu não estiver por perto
Que você é especial pra caralho
Eu queria ser especial

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar

Ela está fugindo pela porta
Ela está fugindo
Ela corre, corre, corre, corre
Corre

Seja lá o que te faz feliz
Seja lá o que você deseje
Você é especial pra caralho
Eu queria ser especial

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar
Eu não pertenço a este lugar"

Nick Wyatt	Well, maybe the band feel that this is a millstone around their necks . . . . but this song spoke to the many millions of introspective loner's and weirdo's around world. It didn't give them a 'voice' because they cannot have a voice and still be weirdo's. But this was a pretty good start.

Balendula	"It's a shame that Radiohead (Particularly Thom)don't like the song. It may not be as sophisticated or nuanced as their later work, but it's emotional, relatable, and overall a good song. It's aged wonderfully. It's almost as if they went back in time and recorded this music video as a pastiche to the grunge era. It doesn't feel like they were following a ""trend"" of the time. It's incredibly self-aware on a level that resounds into 2022. They released a remix in 2021, which goes to show you how much they know that the song still follows them no matter what."

It's quite a piece Jungian psychology, if you have read his books and the books of his assistants. Not light subject at all. You have learn lots of religions and you have to learn about the alchemists. If you are after this since your teenagerhood things will come to you.

Sometimes solving radioactive equations when I was teen, I thought it was easy to turn lead into gold.

But throughout your life things come to you. As I found this tiny book by Abraham Maslow in a library. He would put things very simple. If you are kind , you have mental health, if you are wicked, you are sick in the head.

It's hard to be kind and to be Dom Quixote in this world and everybody is a creep."

carapatata_	"When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye,
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry,
You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world,
I wish I was special,
[Album version:] You're so fucking special.
[Clean version:] You're so very special.

[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts,
I want to have control,
I want a perfect body,

I want a perfect soul,
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
[Album version:] You're so fucking special,
[Clean version:] You're so very special,
I wish I was special.

[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

Oh, oh

She's running out again,
She's running out...
She run run run run...
Run...

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
[Album version:] You're so fucking special,
[Clean version:] You're so very special,
I wish I was special...
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here."

Oleksii Shapiro	это вспенивает кровь
The Royale Ink	"This is a song about a time he was madly in love with a girl he never spoke to, a girl that basically didn't know he existed but in his eyes she was perfect. He used to follow her around and watch her, and in his eyes she was perfect, and always too scared to approach her. His self confidence had always been low but it got worse over time, and he saw himself as a creep for basically stalking her - she even coincidentally went to one of his concerts (""when you was here before, couldn't look you in the eyes""). He actually hates this song, because who would wanna relive their darkest time? Keep this in mind when you hear the song, it makes it even more deep. <3"

dorindaletitbe	The dude said this song is about how totally shy he became when he saw this one girl at college that he couldn’t speak. So,he watched from a distance. After a while he ,he found himself feeling creepy about how he would watch her all the time but never speaking to her. After he became a full on musician,he stopped playing this particular song in public. After a while,everyone was begging for it so he caved in. I think the article said he saw her again years later and spoke to her but not about this song. He then started playing it for the public but he never really could enjoy the song because of how it originated.

[Album version:] You're so fucking special,
[Clean version:] You're so very special,
I wish I was special.

[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

Oh, oh

She's running out again,
She's running out...
She run run run run...
Run...

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
[Album version:] You're so fucking special,
[Clean version:] You're so very special,
I wish I was special...
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here."

Renato Amaro	I heard this song for the first time a couple of months ago. It says a lot to me. I keep thinking of the limitations of the human condition, of the eternal search for happiness. Always looking for it in the wrong places and keeping searching without finding it. It is said that one of symptoms of craziness is to try the same experiences trying to get a different outcome.

제주 귀덕골방에 손님이 신청해주신 음악입니다.

음악은 추억이 아닐까요
누군가에 신청곡으로 첨 듣는 음악을 듣게 되고
어디선가 그음악을 또 듣게 되면
아! 골방에서 들었던 그노래

이런 추억을 다른이에게도 만들어주셨내요

누군가 듣고싶어 신청해주신 이노래를
만들어주신 작사,작곡, 편곡자분들과 불러주신 가수분에게 
정말 감사합니다.


제댓글이 많아 불편하셨다면 정말 죄송합니다.

하지만 제 댓글이 많다는건
이노래를 신청해주신 분들이 많다는거에요

그시간에 신청해주신 분이 이댓글을 보신다면
행복해 하실꺼라는걸 알거든요

그래서 신청곡이 들어올때마다 댓글을 남겨드리고 있어요

좋은 음악들을 많이 듣게되어 행복합니다.

Planes & helicopters won't fly anymore the Military can't save any of you any time soon.  I hope this isn't true & isn't at all paradoxical.  

You all need to bring me somewhere Defensible & Respectable, I don't is really possible to escape right now.

Something about the way he looked at me made me realize that I'm going to spend the rest of my life with him. 3 years later he's at bootcamp now, and I still revisit this song every time I miss him. Thank you for this masterpiece.

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

I wish I was special

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out

I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice

So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep

Daryn Towse	"Pray for your enemy.  Not so much that it will do much good for them but that you release the hate and anger from your heart. Practice turning the other cheek.  Practice patients.  Be meek. Be humble.  Come to Yeshua in the simlatude of that of a small child.  For in our Heavenly Father's eyes we don't live long enough to be anything but children.  Keep Yeshua's Commandments. Love Heavenly Father with all your heart, mind, soul and strength.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Yeshua's two great Commandments encompass all ten of that of his Heavenly Father.  Keep Heavenly Father's Commandments.  They are the harmonic balancer for equality for all of Heavenly Father's children.
The Ten Commandments are the governor of responsibility and actions.  If everyone obeyed these precepts there would be no more problems.  Heavenly Father is love.
Yeshua showed us that love.  Love is the answer.
                        LOVE!!!💞
The Truth when you find it, maybe the wisdom to rise above it.  Never stop learning.  Until you know what Heavenly Father knows, you still have room to grow.  People fail for their lack of knowledge.  The oil in your lamp is knowledge.  Be a wise virgin.  Be as wise as the serpent and as gentle as the dove.
MAY HEAVENLY FATHER, HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON YESHUA AND THE HOLY SPIRIT GUIDE YOU AND BLESS YOU 🕊️👰."

John Lemon	I don't usually write comments because I'm not sure in my English, but now I wanna say how Radiohead really helps me. All my life I feel like a creep, I always just wanted to be like other kids, to play with them but they hated me. When I grew up almost every guy I liked humiliated me. The pain is almost unbearable, all my life I just want to know what's wrong with me? I haven't left the house for almost 3 months because I disgust of myself and I don't want anyone to see me. But the loneliness became unbearable. I decided to ask one guy I know from Instagram to go to the movie. I was terribly afraid that I would not be able to talk to him and that it would be bad, but actually it was really nice and we talked all the time. I felt so alive and happy, so happy so I danced in a way to home. I thought I finally found a friend, everything seemed perfect, but ... The next morning his instagram acc was gone. It immediately occurred to me that he did it to get away from me. It’s so hard to realize that you’re so disgusting that a person shuts down social media because of you. Everyone assured me it wasn't because of me but deep down I knew it was because of me. A few days ago he returned Instagram and I asked him if he was okay and he didn't answer anything and then I asked him if we would see each other (cuz we had some plans) and he didn't answer anything. It was clear to me that he didn't want to talk to me anymore. Oh god I just wanted some human being in my life ... Then I looked on instagram again and realized he deleted me of close friends. I just asked him to tell me why he stopped talking to me because I just want to know what is wrong with me but he will probably never answer. I feel so lonely, I feel like a monster that no one will ever love. I just want this pain to go away

Travis Sweat	"Such a Freak
by
Travis of Bickley 

I'm such a freak. I'm Radiohead times 10 to the nth.
I am the Everest to the depth of the Marianas Trench. 

I am so far above the height that is higher, by far, than the lowest is of the low.
I am not the wind of gale, or breeze, or typhoon so. More than the essence of all of these, for I am the final blow.


I am the Giza Pyramid trespassing  and fasting upon the London Bridge through an Arizona Desert as it were. 

I am the muddled, mudded  hooves trudging through the woods of war, where the wars of the woods are waged.
I am the California Sequoias, and the taller still, Coastal Reds, tallest  of all, stretching for the stars above ungauged. 

I'm such a freak. I'm Radiohead times 10 to the nth.
I am the Everest to the depth of the Marianas Trench..."

You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special.."

Vicki Mills	Was a masterpiece, is a masterpiece and will always be a masterpiece. This is my all time favourite song
ThePoetryBlade	"The song was totally intended to be sarcastic. ""You're so fucking special. I wish I were special!"" As far as I know in my studies it's plain and simple sarcasm. Sarcasm! But let me apologize in advance, because people like me- geeky, nerdy, picked last for a badminton team, bullies beat us at home-namely our parents- and then we were off to school and Bullies beat us in the bathrooms, and we're told to keep our mouths shut, not to tell anyone. I had my bicycle vandalize. I stood there and watched them kick and punch it over and shoving it and bending the bars.

So with that in mind, I must let you know. We've already made this our anthem. We are the Geeks. We are the picked on. We are pissed."

yo no pude mirarte a los ojos.
Eres como un ángel,

Flotas como una pluma
en un mundo hermoso,
desearía ser especial,
tú eres tan especial.
Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
No importa si duele,
quiero tener el control,
quiero un cuerpo perfecto,
quiero un alma perfecta,
quiero que tú te des cuenta
de cuándo yo no estoy a tu alrededor.
Eres tan tan especial,
desearía ser especial.
Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
Ella otra vez se va corriendo,
ella se va corriendo, corre...
Lo que sea que te haga feliz,
cualquier cosa que quieras,
eres tan, tan especial.
Desearía ser especial,
pero soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar,
no pertenezco a este lugar."

adventure skaut	"This song starts off slowly, but quickly turns loud, as if the singer rages within himself due to his circumstances, but at the end when you expect another guitar riff it kind of dies down and a piano plays instead, which to me shows the singer has accepted that the object of his desire will never reciprocate his feelings
Its a bittersweet thing with the accent on the bitter part"

Pinto Alpha	"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9

Paty Mejia	"Tengo 13, obvio jamás e tenido novio, y tampoco me a gustado nadie 

Me gusta la letra de esta canción 

Tengo Tricotilomanía es lo peor del mundo, estoy muerta en vida, por mi ansiedad y nunca se quita, tengo desde los 4, y se fue a los 7, después de unos años volvió. ........ Y peor, ya no puedo salir me da pena, me critican, me juzgan, hasta mi propia familia,....


En las noches siempre lloro le pido a Dios que me ayude porque ya no puedo más,...

Pero jamás me término de desahogar. Hasta que conocí esta canción, no me identifica con la letra pero es,....
Relajante, Poética,..
 Muchas cosas por eso es mi canción favorita,

Siempre que la escuchó me puedo desahogar, es como mejor amiga, porque es como si le contará todos mis secretos y los guarda.... parece loco pero es verdad.

Solo eso. ...."

MIXMUSIC🎶	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?

China Only	"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16

God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time."

David Owen	13 years ago my sister committed suicide.This track was on her CD player. She was receiving crap treatment from the NHS and told she wasn't brave enough to do it. She was a teacher bullied by students then bullied by the very people who were suppose to help. This track still reduces me even after all this time. Utterly awful to think this is what she thought of herself. She was special. Really fucking special to so many people.

Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special

Zippy Thekid	When you were here before! Do overs allowed!
G MAIL	"This guy got into my head and perfectly yet simply articulated what I was thinking but could not form the words to say. Why did these gorgeous young women show an interest in an ugly, skinny, weak, broke, weird, half-bald loser like me? 

Was it because they felt sorry for me? Did they like it when they caught me checking them out? Did they like my eccentricities? Was my odd sense of humor appealing? Was I macho to them in a subdued way? 

I will never understand female psychology. If I saw a female version of me, I would look the other way."
Ercihan Eren	life is strange True Colors'dan geliyorum
elena francorsi	Questa canzone esprime bene il senso di indadeguatezza che prima o poi ognuno di noi prova nella propria esistenza. La musica è bellissima, le parole sono coltelli che feriscono le orecchie, la ricerca della bellezza e del successo e questo frustante senso di inadeguatezza rispetto allo stereotipo giovane emerge come un grido di aiuto sordo

ibrahim nata surya c.d.p.	never get bored everytime hear this song
mysticbarb	this song is about to what extend you can hate yourself and love somebody so insanely at the same time. there's so much rage in this song but at the end when it says ' whatever makes u happy. whatever u want. you're so fucking so special i wish i was special'  breaks my heart into infinite pieces. sometimes it kills you inside see someone so beautiful and you know you love them but you also know that you'd never be loved that way

Ana	"Tradução 
Quando você esteve aqui
Não conseguia te olhar nos olhos
Você é como um anjo
Sua pele me faz chorar

Você flutua como uma pena
Em um mundo tão belo
Eu queria ser especial
Você é especial pra caralho

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar

Eu não ligo se isso machuca
Eu quero ter o controle
Eu quero um corpo perfeito
Eu quero uma alma perfeita

Eu quero que você perceba
Quando eu não estiver por perto
Que você é especial pra caralho
Eu queria ser especial

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar

Ela está fugindo pela porta
Ela está fugindo
Ela corre, corre, corre, corre
Corre

Seja lá o que te faz feliz
Seja lá o que você deseje
Você é especial pra caralho
Eu queria ser especial

Mas eu sou uma aberração
Eu sou um esquisitão
Que diabos estou fazendo aqui?
Eu não pertenço a este lugar"
tomioka_giyuu_isNot_depressed♡	Men thoughts.
Barbara Lima	Vim pela cena da novela!
Vapor Trails	I got this on auto play. This song, more than perhaps any other, sums up what I hate so much about the 90s, and 90s music in particular. The whining. The relentless whining, when things weren’t that bad at all, compared to now, when everything has truly sucked since 2008. Self-absorbed, navel gazing negativity for absolutely no reason. It’s like all of these grunge acts just wanted to ruin anyone’s great mood that they had in the 80s, out of spite. I despise it. Truly awful music. Even hair metal was better than grunge.
Mean Lean G	This song keeps me calm no matter what day I’m having even when he’s my self this song make me realize I’m not part of this society I’m above the bull shit… sipping on this bottle thank god for artist like this we need newer songs that last a lifetime and speak on every moment luv

I need him as a ""Personal Jesus"" and Savior."

Shawna Weiss	"This song is so demonic.  It’s like Satan captivates the soul of people who listen and don’t understand their purpose in this life.  It’s lyrics are captivating and will keep you in a lost world of thinking you’re nothing and the life you’re living is a screwed up one with no ending, but a hellish existence.  Not true!
Jesus is your answer.  Read what he did for you if you were the only person on the face of the earth.  Have faith in him and you will be saved.  Trust Jesus alone for your salvation and you will not perish.  John 3:16.  This life is short and then there is judgment and eternal life in heaven or hell.  It’s your choice.  This song is a creep of a song.  Lies."

I dont't want a perfect body
I don't want a perfect soul
I don't want you to notice

Aaron Flores	Honestly the only difference between an introvert and an extrovert is that a extrovert doesn’t think twice before saying or doing something. That’s how o made the switch. It was awkward and hard but anytime I met someone new I was super friendly and acted as if I knew them a while and they matched my energy. I swear no one is gonna cringe at you. Good luck

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo

a7	The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

Even the people you think are ""like an angel"" with ""a perfect body and soul"" are only human and have their own doubts and insecurities, especially around those who they like and admire."

Acid Spitting Llama	"To the person who comes to my mind everytime I hear this song, 

Hello. I'm really sorry if I ever make you uncomfortable, if I made you ever think of me as a 'stalker', a 'creep', a 'freak' or an 'obsessed' person. I really just never felt this way before, and I only did that so I can make you feel how special you are to me, I just want to be enough in your eyes, and I just wanted you to feel cared about. 

Lately, I noticed how much you try to keep your distance away from me, and that's okay; I'm cool with whatever makes you happy and whatever you want. I just wanted you to know that you can run away everytime for I know what I'm doing is too much and you're just not used with that kind of treatment. 

Again, I'm sorry if I ever gave you trauma or some stuff that I'm not aware of, and don't you worry because right now, I'm trying my best to have control, and to learn that you don't want me and I don't belong in your life, and I promise you that one day, I won't be trying so hard to try to fit myself in there anymore. 

May you find the peace you always seek for, and I'm sorry for taking that away from you in the first place. :))"
Javon McCovery	"LYRICS:

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Its no wonder that so many don't f**king give a shit about anything anymore.

Tom WC	I remember hearing this song in a strip club here in Ipswich, UK. just came out of a 10 year marriage, and was very drunk and depressed, just monging out listening to this after too many beers, smoke thick in the air. was the perfect song for the given situation, seeing the middle aged desperation and loneliness around me looking at an 18-19 year old girls..I'm now happily married again, but i often think how  the other guys watching and the strippers too

SixPack Musthave	It hurts when you know that you'll never live life the way you wanted, when you have this responsibility to take care of your family cause your dad can't walk anymore, your mom has a tumor in her neck, and your siblings still needed their education, so you have to work not 9 to 5, but 6 to 6 just so you can support the bare minimum of your family needs, no more friends, no more trips and no more dreams. You know that you'll have to work for the rest of your life until you're 50 and that's when you're free from these responsibilities but no energy left to do what you always wanted to do. Reality is always harsh, painful and sad.

Corey Merrill	It's mildly upsetting on some level this is the most hated song of theirs... Radiohead fan I am not, but I do like several tracks and while I get this doesn't represent what they wanted to sound like , it still resonates with the world decades later because that raw feeling still comes through and makes their hate of the song, give the song presence and a power it would not otherwise have.

Sean Hollins	I have to admit I like both songs The hollies and Radiohead version I do understand the Radiohead version is not totally original because of the music  but I think the lyrics in both songs are pretty special I've noticed that everyone seems to have a special kind of connection with these songs. That is very evident in the comment section of both songs. They seem to take people back to a certain periods of life and  reminds us of places or people it may   seem to be a different experience for everyone. It's that warm and fuzzy feeling of nostalgia that really makes them special, I guess...What more could you ask? Sometimes that is all we need, but what do I know,  I'm just a weirdo.

Pauly New Buns	"I know Radiohead themselves hate this song now, but no other song spoke to the entire world of teens, outcasts, and outsiders like this one did.
Didn't matter if you were into rap, R&B, or pop, this song was the anthem of the time.
I will never forget this song, and return here every so often"

Sons of the Flood	The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit of time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. At 20 °C (68 °F), the speed of sound in air is about 343 metres per second (1,235 km/h; 1,125 ft/s; 767 mph; 667 kn), or a kilometre in 2.9 s or a mile in 4.7 s. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a sound wave is propagating. At 0 °C (32 °F), the speed-of-sound is 1,192 km/h, 741 mph. The speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior. In colloquial speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: typically, sound travels most slowly in gases, faster in liquids, and fastest in solids. For example, while sound travels at 343 m/s in air, it travels at 1,481 m/s in water (almost 4.3 times as fast) and at 5,120 m/s in iron (almost 15 times as fast). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (39,000 ft/s), — about 35 times its speed in air and about the fastest it can travel under normal conditions. Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and a different type of sound wave called a shear wave, which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds than compression waves, as exhibited in seismology.

I'm Japanese, so I used a translator to look it up and write it.  I hope it is transmitted well.🇯🇵🗻🗼🏯🌸"
Sean Pearl	What makes art so attractive is we can interpret it to be relatable to ourselves.  Even if we interpret the song differently from the artist, we can 'make it our own.'  And that is where it becomes powerful and intimate.

What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out

Raising Active Readers	I love this song also!  I english online to kids in China. Another teacher posted on FB that she had a student during introductions to ask if she knew this song. She said yes. So, at 5:30 AM the English teacher and Chinese student started singing this song. I laughed so hard when I heard this story. I also love this song because I think all of us feel so weird or different at times in our lives. My daughter has a very high IQ and, even I think she feels very different from a lot of kids. I think she identifies with kids that feel different. She loves kids that are on the Austism Spectrum. I never knew that kids with a high IQ would feel different and have a hard time socially also. Her high IQ comes from my husband's side of the family. So, this is all new to me. I hope all kids feel special, because God made us all.

Dermacrosis	The theme tune of puberty to start with and then after it for those who choose to actually embrace their weirdoness. Though ironically being so is the best thing, as long as no one is harmed, as it makes you interesting. Normal is boring, anyone can be normal after all.

Matthew Devereux	I have done my Nobel Prize for Literature work (redistributing it to over 700 female writers) but nobody has noticed or gives a cricket toss. I am at @devereuxmatthew, come connect with me and send me abuse about how poor my writing is by direct message please. I am such a creep that this society has turned me into Diogenes the cynic living in a barrel without clothing shouting at passers-by who hate me. At Oxford University I lived next door to a Radiohead and heard him play piano through the walls of my flat in Jericho - I should probably invoice him for it, it was lovely to listen to as I got drunker than Winston Churchill and failed to do a single stroke of work whatsoever.

S.S	right now , you are right because I did not have the best of boyfriends , my skin got better,  graceful about the place , usually before tripping on a pavement for my dreaming... and... I have no where to run just yet but if I had anything left , if I had the will to. I would, I just don't know where or when. ..if they ever let me. I'm not exactly found or free yet. That's not an invite to anyone.... Except.... nevermind.. Its just...it does mind... I mind . I do.

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

F125yourself	"Its too bad that ""artist's"" don't create for the masses to share in that creation. Instead they take an ownership to the emotion it produces and then restrains it if it doesn't develop as they intended.

Take the vocal right off the track, the emotional movement and cadence of the instruments together are very powerful, overwhelming actually. Listen to just the tune with a good headset, its very moving. Its a masterpiece, the way its laid out. Certainly one of the best of the Y2K era."

Wolfmen	Who is here from Life Is Strange True Colors
Sebastian Bonnett	The Simp anthem
Robb Flynn	This is an unhealthy song that is part of the agenda of unsettling of our young generation.  It encourages them to feel alone, believe they are misfits, question their sexuality.  If you feel these things, stop drinking and taking drugs, eat well.  Get away from your computer.  Put down your Iphone.  Get out there.  Exercise.  Enjoy nature.  Be kind to others, work hard, set a good example, take pride in yourself and whatever else you do.  ABOVE ALL REALISE YOU ARE UNIQUE SO DO NOT FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF, remember there are people in the world far worse off than you.  I would also say find God but if you do the things I say you will find him.

baxdraider ontadron	Recuerdo que hace tiempo conocí a una chica que era bastante genial, hablabamos de todo, era súper agradable y un poco insegura pero le encantaba cantar y aunque le daba vergüenza lo hacía muy bien, cuando la escuché por primera vez de verdad me encantó su voz, y como ella decía que le gustaba mi voz tiempo después quice cantarle una canción especial a pesar de que yo no soy alguien que canta, está fué mi primera elección así que la estuve escuchando hasta que me la aprendí y de ahí solo esperé para cantarsela, han pasado más de 7 meses desde que ella no me habla, creo que se olvidó de mí, y nunca pude cantarsela. Cada vez que escucho Creep y la canto en voz baja no puedo evitar que se me salgan algunas lágrimas.

Pautau	Damn, Life is Strange always has the best songs.
Mehak Verma	I know I'm beautiful, but I wish I was special. A guy like you would never even notice me. I don't stand out from all the other girls. I wish I had the perfect body. I want him to notice when I'm not around. I'm no better looking than the next girl. I'm such a creep, I know which class you have next. I can't approach you because I don't want to mess anything up. But in the end, I just want you to hold me in your arms. I'm a creep and a weirdo for thinking about you like this. I don't know where I belong, but if its not with you, then I don't want to belong. Maybe if others respected me I'd be more special. But I'm the annoying teacher's pet. He wouldn't want me. Only the fat/scrawny guys who have bad grades think I'm in their league. But I want you, because you look like an angel. Your skin makes me cry. Is it wrong to think like that? Of course it is. Anyway I hope you enjoyed that little sad story about my pitiful life.
Eric Ferguson	not that great of a song, stick to Beatles.
Ely Rodriguez	🖤😪

ESPAÑOL
Cuando estuviste aquí antes
No pude mirarte a los ojos
Tú eres como un ángel
Tu piel me hace llorar
Tu flotas como una pluma
En un mundo hermoso
desearía ser especial
Eres tan jodidamente especial
Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco aqui
No me importa si duele
Quiero tener el control
Quiero un cuerpo perfecto
Quiero un alma perfecta
quiero que se den cuenta
Cuando no estoy cerca
Tan jodidamente especial
desearía ser especial
Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco aqui
Ella está corriendo por la puerta (corre)
Ella se está acabando
Ella corre, corre, corre, corre
Correr...
Lo que te haga feliz
Lo que quieras
Eres tan jodidamente especial
desearía ser especial
Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco aqui
No pertenezco aqui"

Shane Morrison	"By a large group of aparently cowardly corrupt luciferic deities/spirits I was sexually abused out of having sex multiple times today repulsively selfish-like for my energy like an involuntarily abused like a sacrifice to the point of murdering. Many priests call my oppression one that is by malignant demons that use my own mind against me. There is no good in the universe, angels can be disgusting, horrible, selfish intentionally ignorant creatures, that consume your energy unknowingly in order to have sex with each other.

Two demons came through my otherside roughly seven years ago... And the ones on my otherside that were even there my entire life, let the ignorant spirits get respected by most of them (or virtually all of them) for torturing me everyday with voices/touching me sexually in order to abuse me/ being malicious with the love of my suffering being expressed every day of my life. I am on disability for it and have lost my beautiful baby boy because of how my otherside became cruel and unjust for my energy... I couldn't cope with being taken down by these mallicious spirits at work, this led to disability. The fact that I don't yet know how to kill or sufficiently hurt these demons or deities as they dance around like jesters, tell me anxiety evoking potential theories such as: ""They get power from a demon called astaroth in order drain me"" and do cruel sexual gestures at me every single day...They are nothing more than sellfish cowards that desperately need to deceive anybody else's otherside in order to avoid blame. I can't stand my otherside. I am not even suicidal, I just can't get away from these malignant inhumane idiots. Please someone or somebody or something kill these effing creatures on my otherside. I have never not been betrayed on the otherside. What did I do to deserve nothing from anyone good hearted enough to be humane and tell me something that works. How do I kill this these demons like ""catnips"" ""provide"" and ""bowsir"" telling me they're Godfull, when it's the opposite and they're actually quite evil. What did I do?"

Forrest Morris Jr	"I going to be truthful, I didn't dsicover this song until a few years ago, keeping in mind I was a whopping 37 when it was released, I listen to Radiohead on occasions, but this song is just amazing when played through a High End Stereo System, streaming does the song NO justice.
For the record alt music took awhile to catch on, in my case,  now I find some of the music interesting and very relevent even today, from a rock fan."
Selio Lopes	Lindíssima maravilhosa gata sem mais delongas Lilly Wood.
Selviora Light	Привет, десятилетняя Я. Тебе сейчас 23 и ты не выросла в успешную леди, не приблизилась к своим мечтам и до сих пор не поняла, чего же хочешь в этой жизни на самом деле и куда стремиться. Но не бойся, я с тобой. Наш путь ещё не окончен.

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special 



But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here


I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special


But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh


She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run


Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

“JCX”	When my son was little he had one of those play guitars and it had this song and i had to sing along while he was playing.  It has very emotional trigger every-time i hear the song i mourn the time he was just a kid and we were so close that time forever gone 😢.

𝚅 𝚠𝚛𝚡𝚝𝚑	My dad used to play this song when a was 4 good times
Joshua Peterson	Went to Israel for a month long class on the Bible in college.   Thanks to relaxed alcohol rules, a DJ who understood seeing 30 Americans,  in a disco in the basement of our hotel, this song has so much meaning.  Yes, Radiohead is more than this, but it got a lotta ears through that door.
me	cancion de mierda
EnderGamer 3600	This was made when I was born :D
Александр Балаганов	Очень хорошая, старая песня.

Aquiles Rojas	some day, not perfect, but better
bip	This song introduced me to Radiohead when I was in my first few years of uni being that depressed student having to jog through many, many lectures pre-covid19. Ingenue from Atoms for Peace quickly became my top favourites. I will never ever forget Radiohead. That angst, sorrow, sadness and cringe we sometimes experience is just so relatable. For that special sorrowful day, Radiohead just accesses the part of your soul that just wants to be peaceful in this chaotic world.

LennHy	"Una chica que conocí desde hace 3 años , nos hicimos amigos y ese mismo año se notaba que nos gustábamos mutuamente , estuve a punto de declararmele cuand pum!!
covid-19 en mi pais , en ese entonces no tenia redes sociales a pesar de vivir en la potencia mundial de hoy en día xd. entonces durante el siguiente año no tuvimos casi nada de contacto excepto por gmail ya que estabamos en la misma escuela y era como nuestra manera de comunicacion porque a pesar de vivir aca mis papas no me podian permitir un celular en ese entonces , me seguia gustando pero no con esa misma intensidad , supuse que la supere y me enamore de otra chica con la cual fui novio por un tiempo . despues de eso le robe el telefono a un ex-vecino xd y pues me hize un facebook. le hable a ella y a mas amigos los cuales aprecio tambien , debo decir que para ese punto llevaba unos 3 años en esa ciudad y a ella la conoci desde el segundo , corte con la otra chica pero mi amiga y yo seguiamos hablando constantemente . Paso un año y ahora ya estamos en la actualidad de hace 3 semanas , donde ya tenia ganas de ver a todos mis compas de la prepa y en especial a ella que le agarre cariño pensando que ya la habia superado , ooh boi , estaba muy equivocado . solo 3 semanas me tomo darme cuenta lo facil que soy de enamorar porque ella lo logro , y se nota que le gusto , estabamos solos y vi esa mirada de ""confiesalo todo porfavor"" en ella , obvio no me quize apresurar y me dio cosa ir muy rapido , me dio el abrazo mas bonito que he tenido en todo el año .el dia siguiente empezaba el fin de semana y pues le hable por messenger y ahora actuaba muy cortante hacia mi , no se que hice pero al parecer perdio todo el interés por mi. me siento mal por no haber hecho nada en ese momento cuando la tuve entre mis manos , por no decirle nada , siento que ese fue mi error . el martes verr si lo puedo solucionar pero por ahora este ha sido el fin de semana mas largo y desde hace un mes solo pienso en ella como para que me deje asi:(
solo nos quedan 2 años para graduarnos de la prepa , llevo 4 en esta ciudad, y ella ha sido la chica que he querdio desde casi que llegué, no busco consolación ni que me funen por la pendejada que habre hecho sin darne cuenta xd
solo me queria desahogarme de esto. (olvide decir que durante la pandemia mis papas no me dejaban salir de la casa ni en joda aunque me escape una que otra vez nunca pudimos vernos en ese año aunque si organizamos una que otra cosa la cual no paso.
Desde el Lennhy de 16 años para el del futuro , echale ganas we , tu puedes con muchas cosas , no te desanimes por las cosas que pasan , suerte<3"

Luana Vitoria	"Bilhetes suicidas espalhados pela casa
Se voce olhar bem em meus olhos
Verá um homem lutando sem alma
Um anjo me visitou uma noite
Falou que eu era especial
E foi embora.
Eu não sei o que isso significa
Completamente fodido
Quando você estar perto eu me sinto vivo
Como se fosse uma barreira
 o clima negativo e as vozes desaparecem, mas quando você vai perco a batalha para a solidão.
Eu nunca quis participar desse jogo chamado vida, e espero nunca mais voltar. E quando eu fechar os olhos, espero nunca mais abri-ló.
A escuridão que me leva
Será a mesma que fará eu desaparecer, fiquem com meu corpo, e queime minha alma até virar pó."
Original OWL	Johnny Greenwood is so incredible. Everything about him. It’s as if someone went in a time machine and brought back a person from the 70s. Love love love.
CamTheCameraman	This song makes me feel better about when I have my crush a rose which I grew for her for Valentine’s Day and after school I watched her give it to another dude, my friends saw and took me away quickly to sit down at a cafe, and one went back and took the rose off her and gave it back to me
Drichmen 27	So fucking special.
Αναστάσιος Κιούσης	Thom Yorke disliked 91 thousand times
k ukokaki	This is song about creeps in dota
LLC	"The saddest thing about this ""introvert song"" is that I lost my virginity at the same age that Thom Yorke is in this video.  That's 25 for those who don't know his birthday.  The average age of virginity loss in my country is 17 years old.  I'm not the latest bloomer I know but I'm in the oldest 5% of the population.  Not sure if that's something to be proud of seeing as I kinda threw it away to a highly abusive partner.  But this song sometimes reminds me of that.  Not in a bad way. But the lyrics sound like I'm talking to her when I sing it.  Took me 2 years of therapy to put her behind me."
alyssa joy black	I feel like the fact Radiohead hates this song makes it even more poignant- a masterpiece it’s creators detest…the song itself is a creep. And my anthem.

Cook	A Reminder of hat I am who I am this is my anthem for myself I had dyslexia as a kid Ocd and anxiety and it's I'll never be... it keeps me grounded as I hold too high of standards...sometimes your mind ticks you out by thinking that killing would make the best sleep ever ...I can't go... yet more things to do...

I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

PitagorasThe	"During 10 years of depression and overwhelming loneliness I often played it on my guitar thinking of myself but now Im more like

""And I'm no creep,
I'm no weirdo,
I know what I'm doing here
I just belong here""

So to every single soul listening to this I wanna say Hang in there mates, you're doing great, if you feel lost in this world please do find a psychologic help but don't give up. Do change only things that are ""objectively"" bad and hurting you and the people around and try to improve yourself (best by some activities and hobbies - one or two small are great to begin) but do not change your personality because
 YOU ARE ONLY ONE UNIQUE UNIT ON THIS PLANET and definitely worth to speak to, get friendship, get love and romantic relationships. Keep it up!"

Kanhai	jonny greenwood>>>most guitarists
Jotaro Kujoñ	i dont hate this song or the people who cover it, but it pisses me off when i see covers of this song because the only people who do that are white girls who have probably  never been rejected (the song is about being rejected by your crushes) just because it sounds sad without ever thinking of the meaning, which it sucks that people do that.

Harry Medina	Esta canción me encantaba cuando tenía 12 años y no tenía ni idea de la traducción, pero se sentía triste, así que, cada vez que estaba deprimido solía escucharla. Después de haber terminado mi carrera de ingles la volví a escuchar y aún a mis 41 años me gusta, aunque eso de estar tras alguien que no te presta atención no ha sido lo mío, pero igual me encanta jodidamente este tema.

Titanium Man	Nothing wrong with being a creep.  It's just the creeps who try to force themselves onto other people.  They want to be friends with you whether or not you want anything to do with them.  That's the difference between being a creep and being creepy.

Man Of Truth	Thats me :)
Vasni Bran	BEST SONG EVER!
Coraima jazmin Rojas Espinoza	A quien más le iso llorar esta música 😭
Christopher Simons	As a person who basically finds almost all songs post the 1980s to be absolute garbage, this is one of a handful of songs from the past 30 years worth a damn to me. It stood out on first hearing, and continues to stand out. Even rarer are post 2000 songs that don't have a laxative effect on me. One of these is Won't go home without you, by Maroon 5 , which shockingly for a song of the past 20 years, has a discernible and actually hummable chorus.
Tim Nicktion	one night in a gay bar with some friends drinking getting loose having fun, ya know, this song comes on. the entire bar stops what theyre doing and all starts singing the chorus in unison, spontaneously. fond memory <3
IanKIIL •MXM•	Tommm
You Need People Like Me	From my 1st time hearing this x song many years ago-I Loved it even though it we not in the genres of music I listened to regularly but I'd have it thrown in between hip hop songs on mixed cds I made & to this day I love it & today I found a video of Prince covering it which I never hears before & it was cool-He changed it to 'Your a Creep but it was enjoyable to watch & listen to & in the last few days I suddenly became a big NIN fan-Wow there a Spiderman ad playing-new 2021 movie that looks good

Paradoxes and Ironies	the very sound of nostalgia
raffaele maruzzelli	This song, in my opinion, is about being human. We want to be special but we are much  more then that, we are unique. There never was and never will someone like us. But we need acknowledgment ‘cause we’ve been told all our life who we are and we have forgot that we are the only ones in the position, literally, to say who or what we really are. It’s so scary and so beautiful to be human and every time I listen to this song  I cry  with gratitude ‘cause I know I’m not alone.

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special


But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here


I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here


She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run


Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special


But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Honey Badger Founder TDLM (TyeDyeLoveMovement)	"To all the women- too many...To all the hearts I’ve broken-4 specifically. Marie Francoise Weber (I brought her flowers when I was 5 years old and was an amateur skateboarder for Gravity going pro) Lauren Drinhause (sponsored skateboarders), Christina Alvarez, and Sarah do- Team Manager and world record breaking athlete. My actions haunt me daily. I cry so much I wash my face in hand sanitizer here in the hospital after being the victim of sexual battery, mental breakdown/4 5150s, one 5250, three counts of strong armed robbery with a prior-one was a pharmacy in Encinitas. 
It’s over for me. 
Three strikes I’m looking at life in federal prison. 
Thank you women for allowing me to know love. I’d trade my entire mafia to know that love again and be in a woman’s arms with a dog and skateboard by my bed. After the hospital at UCSD it’s work release or jail then federal prison. 
If you’re reading this learn from me Evan Grant Spencer. 
I gang banged on sorrento valley FBI love on Instagram. 
Broke a world record skateboarding. 
Formed my own mafia/outfit to hunt rapists and child molesters. 
I’ve lived laughed and loved and it was over before I turn 32 on September 6th. 
Whenlove finds you never let go. 
It is lonely at the top. 
Ask sorrento valley FBI. I did it all. 
Now I’m just waiting to rot in a cell for the rest of my life. 
Honestly, levinsworth was my retirement plan all along. 
I’m afraid to face God too. 
I’m a creep.
I don’t belong here either."

小嶋保	"When you were here before
前にきみがここにいたときは
Couldn't look you in the eye
目を合わせることもできなかった
You're just like an angel
きみはまるで天使のようで
Your skin makes me cry
その肌に触れるだけで、僕は涙が出てしまう

You float like a feather
きみは羽根のように舞う
In a beautiful world
この美しい世界の中を
I wish I was special
僕も特別な人間だったらなぁ
You're so fucking special
きみは本当に特別な人だよ 



But I'm a creep
でも、僕は気味の悪いやつで
I'm a weirdo
変わっているやつで
What the hell am I doing here?
僕はどうしてここにいるの？
I don't belong here
ここは僕の居場所なんかじゃない

I don't care if it hurts
傷つくことは気にしない
I want to have control
でも、自分の意志は持っていたい
I want a perfect body
僕は完璧な身体が欲しいんだ
I want a perfect soul
僕には完璧な精神が必要なんだ

I want you to notice when I'm not around
そばにいなくても、きみには僕のことを知っていてほしい
You're so fucking special
きみはすごく特別な人なんだ
I wish I was special
僕もそうだったらよかったのになぁ

But I'm a creep
でも、僕は気味の悪いやつで
I'm a weirdo
変わっているやつで
What the hell am I doing here?
なのに、僕はどうしてここにいるの？
I don't belong here
ここは僕の居場所なんかじゃない

She's running out again
彼女がまた離れていく
She's running
彼女は離れていってしまう
She runs runs runs runs
どんどん離れていって
Runs
去っていってしまう

Runs
いなくなってしまう

Whatever makes you happy
幸せを感じられるものすべて持っている
Whatever you want
欲しいものすべて持っている
You're so fucking special
だって、きみは本当に特別な人だから
I wish I was special
僕も特別だったらなぁ

But I'm a creep
でも、僕はただ気味の悪いやつで
I'm a weirdo

hello kitty	this was our song.
Stick Person	I find it kinda funny how I always felt this was a very queer song. Three or so days ago I heard the story that inspired the song, it's the singer liking a girl and not knowing how to talk to her, eventually kinda stalking her and scaring her where he eventually did talk to her. Not as gay as I still imagine it to be and I don't care.
lama donito	Really like the song

전에 네가 여기 있었을 땐
Couldn't look you in the eye

Your skin makes me cry
살결조차 날 울게 만드니까

You float like a feather
넌 아름다운 세상에
In a beautiful world
떠다니는 깃털만 같아
And I wish I was special
나도 내가 특별하면 좋겠어
You're so fuckin' special
넌 존나 특별하니까

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
근데 난 병신이야, 이상한 놈이라고.
What the hell am I doing here?
내가 여기서 뭔 짓거릴 하는거야?
I don't belong here.
이러고 있으면 안되는데

I don't care if it hurts
고통스러워도 괜찮아
I want to have control
내 뜻대로 됐으면 좋겠어
I want a perfect body
내가 완벽한 몸이 된다면 좋겠어
I want a perfect soul
내가 완벽한 영혼이 된다면 좋겠어

I want you to notice
네 곁에서 내가 사라지면
When I'm not around
네가 알아줬으면 해
You're so fuckin' special
니가 존나 너무 특별해서
I wish I was special

She's running out
그녀가 멀어져가
She's run, run, run, run

Whatever makes you happy
무엇이 널 행복하게 하건
Whatever you want

Zanussi	OK Computer is about NPC's. For the most part the whole album is about the life of an NPC from a first person perspective. It's kind of of hard to credit now considering Radiohead have become obedient bitches in the last 16 odd years but they used to be quite anti-authoritarian.

juanita lafalce	"Después de sacar las fotos para mi book de 15 (ya que no se festejaba hacía un book) fuimos a comer a un hotel con la fotógrafa, su familia y la mía, en eso de que jodíamos, uno de los chicos se acerca al que cantaba y le dice que era mi cumpleaños (faltaba una semana más o menos jasbdjh), así que el salón empezó a cantar el feliz cumpleaños. Todo bien, todo lindo, un chico que estaba en la mesa de al lado se acerca al escenario porque quería cantar algo, en la mesa todos nos miramos re ""Este va a cantar cualquiera"", sube todo tímido al escenario y empieza a cantar esta canción, lo cantaba de una manera tan linda, tenía una re linda voz y cantaba bien, todos en la mesaenloquecidos, termina de cantar y la madre me mira entre todos los aplausos y me dice ""Para vos, feliz cumpleaños"". Me alegró la noche, la semana, jdshijadfjksbhf. Modo feliz <3

Gracias por leer, que tengas un buen día, tarde o noche!, cuídate mucho."

Jocimar	Would be wrong if I, say it here that I like my pain. It's something that makes me feel alive, is either this or the feeling of feeling literally nothing and that's what I fucking hate the most. So whenever I feel depressed or extremely anxious, it hurts a lot of course it does. However I like it because it makes me feel alive somehow, I know this sounds weird and all but is how I deal with my personal issues. This is song is so special...

Rolando Camero	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"
Kaori Kanzaki	I'm 29 and done with relationships already (either dumped on or cheated or get in an unrequited love) i doubt if I'll ever find the right person because i have lots of scars in my heart that need to be fixed.

Jane Gallagher	I want you to notice when I'm not around...
backpackmc	"Most covers of this song (American Idol, looking at you) are terrible. Not because the singers cant sing - they can - but they miss the point that it's an emotional rant, and it's not meant to sound pretty. The guy's beating himself up for feeling love and loathing and resentment; just don't sing it like a Katy Perry tune, just don't. No offence to KP.

Which is a long-winded way of saying, if you like Creep, you'll love Prince's version at Coachella - his guitar playing is some of his finest, and yet you can hear the torture in it. It was filmed in potato quality, but the audio is just fine.

Search up Prince Coachella Creep on YT. Turn up the volume and turn off the lights. You can thank me later."

Ghost Writer, Inc.	I’m from the Armed Services. If you think we don’t make Teddy Bear look like that, you’re sadly mistaken. He was a Black bear, but they don’t make love or kids with me.
Ghost Writer, Inc.	Ted was the first guy to ever make love to me. But he was hung up on his victims and the fact that he was gonna get caught. They fried him in 1989. A year later, I met Reggie and we got married and had Angela. She’s long gone but studying to be a doctor. She’s okay.

ERDEM	"Dear person whoever reads this, 
Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you one day, because I can tell you have some awesome music taste :) You’re such a beautiful human being and worth and enough. I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy, I know society build up the standard that whenever you’re alone you’re not living a happy live. But in fact that is not true, if you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot  nicer. I hope you let yourself rest, don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you. I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way..I am glad you exist and I hope you won’t ever remove your own spot in this world, maybe you don’t feel like you belong here but, Angel, then build your home here. I don’t want you to leave this world unhappy. I want you to live every little second, I want you to feel alive, I don’t want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it’s not your fault, the demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart, they want to take it because they have never seen such beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? . You’re not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you’re reading this than please never forget to breath and smile. 

Don’t live up to other standards! It’s your story and not theirs. 


Life for those who couldn’t, smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug like its your last one. 

I love you and send you hugs.
You’re so strong, you’re still here, and I am proud of you. 


YOU ARE NOT USELESS. READ THAT AGAIN. 
YOU ARE WORTH IT. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE LOVED. READ THAT AGAIN.
I AM GLAD YOU EXIST. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE NOT A PROBLEM. YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. READ THAT AGAIN.

You’re not a burden to anyone, don’t be afraid to talk, to use your voice. 

You’re beautiful inside out. 

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. READ THAT AGAIN.

I WISH I COULD HUGH YOU RIGHT NOW, SO A VIRTUAL HUG WILL DO. 


It hurts me to see you’re in pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you. 

I love u I love u I love u I love u I love u please don’t go.

I am sorry that no one is hearing you, I am sorry no one is noticing that you have lost yourself. I wish I could take your pain away, it hurts me to see the pain in your eyes.  I love you trough my words and I mean it. I just want you to stay, hold on a little longer okay? Please? For me.??

I hope you have an awesome day/ morning/ evening/ night. 

If it’s night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. 

If it’s day for you, don’t start it by such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits. 

If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed.


And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re stronger than you think, I know you will make it :) 

All I want for you is to stay and feel alive. 

Now wipe those tears away and smile for me, you really don’t know much a smile can brighten someone’s day, do you? I hope one day yours will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore, because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.

I need you here with me :). 

Remember crying is not weakness, let it out as much as you can but don’t let the emotion control you by giving up. It’s okay, you’re here, you’re safe, you can let it out.

Did anyone asked you, how you are feeling today? If not, how are you really? I don’t think you’re doing good, but you will feel good at one point. Don’t give yourself up. 

And anyone who gets to be with you, doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :).

Enough with beating up yourself for today, okay?!

- The stranger that cares about you more than anything.

I hope this is enough for you to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. I hope you can stay.

I hope you will remember my words.- @13rd.m :) <3"

Zeyna Frutuoso	"Lyrics:
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Even in the darkest people there’s something special and we have to fight to let that something become the main thing about us. I hope y’all find love ❤️

Luiz Lourenço	"LYRICS

Creep
Radiohead

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
Oh oh oh oh 

She's running out the door
She's running out
She'll run, run, run, ruuuuunnnn...
Ruuuuunnnn...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

virtuefilms1	"Bob Dylan fooled the world for decades claiming to have written many of the melodies to his hit songs when in fact most of the melodies were from preexisting songs that he did not write, including Blowin In The Wind.
In a last nail in the coffin scenario James Damiano’s movie “Eleven Years” draws the straw that breaks the camel’s back, rivets Bob Dylan to his secret past of plagiarism and rewrites musical history”……Virtue Films
No artist can lay claim to the controversy that has surrounded the career of songwriter James Damiano. Thirty two years ago James Damiano began an odyssey that led him into a legal maelstrom with Bob Dylan that, to this day, fascinates the greatest of intellectual minds.
Since auditioning for the legendary CBS Record producer John Hammond, Sr., who influenced the careers of music industry icons Charlie Christian, Billy Holiday, Bob Dylan, Pete Seger, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Ray Vaughan, James has engaged in a half a billion dollar copyright infringement law suit with Bob Dylan.
As the curtain rises on the stage of deceit we learn that CBS / Sony international recording artist, Bob Dylan not only used songs and lyrics written by James Damiano but also solicited Mr. Damiano’s materials for a period of over ten years and eleven months. One of those songs is nominated for a Grammy as the best rock song of the year. Ironically the title of that song is Dignity.
It is now common knowledge that Bob Dylan has been accused of plagiarism in over two hundred separate incidences. In Dylan’s early career he would plagiarize one or two songs from different artists. By the late seventies his professional schedule became very demanding of his time and he was afforded less time to write. It was at this time he was introduced to James Damiano’s materials.
Damiano a prolific writer provided a treasure trove of material to Dylan over the course of eleven years of which Dylan took the liberty of taking advantage of without crediting Damiano for said materials. Eventually Dylan acquired twenty seven years of James Damiano’s writing.
Bob Dylan’s Stealing of James Damiano’s Songs"
Tampinhaxl	Tomorrow this video will be 13 years old on youtube, deposit your congratulations.
Quantum The Rose	Does anyone else get that the 90s scene seemed to be the human race saying “we failed!” Ever since it’s been the corporate lords of america and capital saying “comon guys, it doesn’t matter, coke is important, icons like apple and snickers they’re what make the west great! All that 5-7 days work is not for little parks and gardens, now you can stream what it took an adventure at a vhs store to do. Cynicism is bad, really really bad, it’s not what built civilisation, that’s where you can rebel, there and crime and drugs. That’ll make you suspicious and paranoid and you won’t be able to make things better.”Does anyone else get that the 90s scene seemed to be the human race saying “we failed!” Ever since it’s been the corporate lords of america and capital saying “comon guys, it doesn’t matter, coke is important, icons like apple and snickers they’re what make the west great! All that 5-7 days work is not for little parks and gardens, now you can stream what it took an adventure at a vhs store to do. Cynicism is bad, really really bad, it’s not what built civilisation, that’s where you can rebel, in cynicism without solutions and here and there and in crime and drugs. That’ll make you suspicious and paranoid and you won’t be able to make things better. But don’t worry, our corporate sponsors have had over a century of expertise at selling bad products. We’ll be in power till the end.”

Thin Wheat Wimp	The thing that makes this song so special is that 99% of other songs sing about either being in a romantic relationship or breaking up in it, while this one is about never getting the chance, something that is far too relatable for many people including myself.

Shay	When you didn't even understand the lyrics fully as a teen,but have lived it as an adult....This song encompasses so much of our humanity and vulnerability and I feel so blessed to have lived as the generation that embraced this   brutally honest song. We live,we learn,we grow,we realize our divinity and look back on those days with a wish that we could go back just once more and hug our loved ones no longer with us and tell our inner child we will make it through and live,love and remember those days with a smile...we rebel children have broken the mold!

T O	I was working the graveyard shift at a UPS warehouse in ‘93 when this song made it big. I was unloading 70 pound boxes out of the back of a trailer one night at 3 AM and I heard those famous lyrics, “What the hell am I doing here, I don’t belong here” I eventually quit to keep my sanity but those lyrics still resonate with me about where I was at that point in my life almost 30 years later.

Fleendar The Magnificent	I can relate to this song. It hurts me, but that's all I have felt my entire life. Hurt, hatred and rejection. Perhaps I am not so magnificent as my avatar name suggests.... My 18 year marriage is ending. My wife is special (in my eyes). I wish I was special. I tried to do everything humanly possible to save my marriage, but she just walked away. At least my children and family still love and want me.... Why does life have to be so painful?
Victor Leonardo Vergara	"Lyrics:
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

Perhaps bands like Radiohead and Pearl Jam were bad at handling and managing their own fame?

Fernanda López Castillo	Les contaré mi pequeña historia “no creo qué les importe “ hace tiempo conocí esta canción y fue por un ex mío cuándo conocí a este chico me parecía inalcanzable para mi ,era tan igual pero al mismo tiempo diferente ami ,el caso es qué al pasar el tiempo el y yo fuimos novios y está canción siempre la ponía cuándo él estaba triste era su favorita ,siempre que nos veíamos nos tirábamos al suelo a ver el cielo y escuchar esta canción el solía cantármela y yo solía mirarlo mientras lo hacia ,pero hace poco tiempo terminamos por chismes y problemas,  apesar de qué él habló mal de mi, cosa qué yo jamás haría (hablar mal de él) yo siempre lo voy a recordar con una sonrisa y con esta linda canción qué acompaña tantos buenos recuerdos y momentos ,siempre que la escucho mi mente se inunda de buenos recuerdos qué jamás se repetirán :(

zhongli's wallet	"Esta canción la escuchaba junto a mi prima cuando solo había MTV, en el cuarto de ella viendo televisión y esperando las mejores canciones. Recuerdo la pantalla de la televisón no más grande que un cuaderno profesional: el mundo era nuestro.
Y aparecía este rolón y me perdía en el mundo de esta banda. 
Y cada vez que la escucho me transporto a esta vida , a esos momentos inolvidables, únicos, fugaces. 
Bendita música que nos lleva allá, a lo perdido físicamente pero eterno en el corazón. 
Ojo: la cuenta es de mi hija, pero no quise cambiarme, no se me fuera a escapar la inspiración."

Darren Ek	Right on good melody!
Shawn N	"Falling for someone that you feel is better than you, feeling awkward and out of place, is a very common experience most people probably go through at some point. Only in the 90s would this very normal experience and feeling be turned into an agonizing, heart-wrenching affair that makes you want to swallow a bullet. 
Hey, don't get me wrong, it is a powerful song, but what it is about is pretty silly if you think about it. A bunch of young guys screaming like their soulmates just walked out on them and it is the end of the world when they are actually describing a very normal situation. 
But like I've always said -
60's music makes you want to do drugs
70's music makes you want to dance
80's music makes you want to party
90's music makes you want to commit suicide
Music after 2000 makes you want to change the station to one playing something before 2000."

저번에 니가 여기 있었을 땐
Couldn't look you in the eye

You're just like an angel

넌 그야말로 천사였고
Your skin makes me cry

훌륭한 살결은 눈물이 날 정도니까



You float like a feather

넌 이 아름다운 세상에서
In a beautiful world

깃털처럼 떠다니는구나
I wish I was special

내가 특별했다면 하고 바라게 돼
You're so fucking special

니가 미치도록 특별하니까


But I'm a creep
하지만 난 병신이야
I'm a weirdo

찌질한 샌님이고
What the hell am I doing here?

대체 내가 뭘 하자고 여기 있는 거지?
I don't belong here

난 이곳에 어울리지 않는 걸


I don't care if it hurts
다치더라도 상관없어
I want to have control

통제권을 갖고 싶어
I want a perfect body

난 완벽한 몸매와
I want a perfect soul

완벽한 영혼을 원해


I want you to notice
내가 주위에 없을 때면
When I'm not around

니가 알아채주길 바래
You're so fucking special

넌 미치도록 특별하고
I wish I was special

나도 특별했으면 좋겠다고



But I'm a creep

I'm a weirdo

찌질한 샌님이고
What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here

난 이곳에 어울리지 않는 걸



Oh, oh

오, 오오

She's running out again

그녀는 또 달아나고 있어
She's running out

그녀가 멀어져
She run run run run

그녀가 달아나, 달아나
Run

도망가

Whatever makes you happy

널 행복하게 하는 무엇이든
Whatever you want

니가 원하는 무엇이든
You're so fucking special

넌 정말 대단히 특별해
I wish I was special

나도 좀 특별했으면 좋겠어

But I'm a creep

하지만 난 병신이야
I'm a weirdo

찌질한 샌님이고
What the hell am I doing here?

대체 내가 뭘 하자고 여기 있는 거지?

bora ciftci	"The Hollies version (1974) of ""The Air That I Breath"" by Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood (1972) meets ""Crying"" by Roy Orbison (1961) melts in Radiohead's pot in a so fuckin' special weirdo jangle beautiful way. One of the top grunge anthem by a classic rock band that hates calling themselves grunge. Let's call them Pablo Honey (1992)."
No Arguments Please	Dave Chapplle singing this recently in front of many fans at a concert really adds to the lore of this song.

Marie Dhouib	"D'où vient la musique ? comment elle se diffuse ? Comment elle est absorbée ? Etc. 
En tout cas, c'est certainement moi qui fut exigeante avec moi. Je peux pas dire ni écrire que c'etait parce que je ne voulais pas ressembler à mon oncle et ses femmes ni à mes frères et  mes parents.  Parce que je  vivais dans des civilisations de jeunes. Et pas avec eux. Pas regulierement avec mon oncle. J'ai travaillé plus de 1500 pour moi avec eux. Cette population sans besoin ni envie. Je ne pourrai pas le refaire avec des vieillards même s'il y aurait plus la guerre."

B F	As I write this I am listening to Creep for the first time in my life. I have lived only slightly longer than the song has existed, and have been more or less aware that it's Radiohead's most iconic and popular song for that entire time. I admit that I don't understand the hype at all. Maybe it's one of those things where you had to be there.

You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"
Jules Love	"I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control

I wish I was special

God, the 90s were the days I noticed how it sucks not to be someone's special person in their lives. Yet, the 90s were the best ten years of my life. Those were the days, of being whatever I wanted and did whatever I wanted. I didnt get the guy, but I married my special man who has made my life awesome."

Mitchell VanPutten	"I wanted to say the Guy or Man after me in here: that I can relate to being born physically with an unattractive body, as I had major* dental work done as a kid, and I had acne, I now have pitted skin and Sebhorreic Dermatitis (flaking skin on my face). Oh, and I'm in a wheelchair, I'm afraid to leave the house.

Now to the other Mr (there will be many Mr's, yes, just don't make a fuss or I'll punish you): the one who is upset 'God created sickness & disease'. Okay, God didn't. Satan did. Satan hates it, as he considers it a massive mistake after an argument with God after which he was upset. So disease is satan's regrettable mistake. This is a great subject to bring up, so thank you also."
Tushar Kapadnis	Who came here after watching the voice's blind auditions... :)
Triadi Satyaditama	"Nice bit of contrast on this one, starting off with wistful lyrics and pretty instrumentation, then crashing directly into blazing cacophony.
Good lyrics, and it very well expresses frustration at oneself and others."

Bobbypins	my mum always plays this song :,)
star girl	"When you were here before

Couldn't look you in the eye

You're just like an angel

Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather

In a beautiful world

I wish I was special

You're so fuckin' special



[Chorus]

But I'm a creep

I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here



[Verse 2]

I don't care if it hurts

I wanna have control

I want a perfect body

I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice

When I'm not around

You're so fuckin' special

I wish I was special



[Chorus]

But I'm a creep

I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here

Oh, oh



[Bridge]

She's running out the door

She's running out

She run, run, run, run

Run



[Outro]

Whatever makes you happy

Whatever you want

You're so fuckin' special

I wish I was special

But I'm a creep

I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here

I don't belong here"

Kahn	"What doomed this awesome song to failure was ""You're so fuckin' special."" - If that would have been changed to ""You're so very special"" it would have went triple platinum globally everywhere in the civilized world. A real shame. This is a great song. Profanity doomed it to where it couldn't even be played on most radio stations. ""What the hell am I doing here"" would have been tolerated. The 2nd verse of profanity buried this great song 6 feet under. How I wish I could have been this group's recording manager back in the day."

Kell Kell	Loved 'Creep' when it came out in 1993 and I still do! However, at that time in my life, I had a now ex-fiancé that wouldn't take 'NO' for an answer. He didn't want to break up the marriage plans, but I did. Beyond that, he stalked me in a weird way at work/home... took a job at my employer's company in a close-by area, bought a truck nearly like mine days after I purchased mine and sent letter after letter of how he knew I loved him & I just didn't 'get it'. Ended up having to take him to court to tell him to back off! Haven't heard from him in a goood long while. Phew.

Winter Lynn	"I was 11 or so when MTV would play this constantly in the early -mid 90s. I didn't fully appreciate it and would either change the channel or mute the TV. I'd been bugging my eldest brother to hook up speakers to my TV so I'd have a surround sound in my room like he had and one day he surprised me with it after school. He said ""let's test it "" and switched to MTV and I rolled my eyes because Creep was playing. However hearing it in that beautiful surround sound, the bass, the guitars, vocals..everything about it sounded unreal. It became one of my favorite songs after that. Can't believe that there was actually a short period of time when I hated this song. Almost 30 years later it's still amazing, surround sound or not."

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Desearia ser especial 
Tu eres tan especial 
Pero soy extraño 
soy raro 
que demonios hago aqui? 
yo no pertenezco aqui. 

No me importa si duele 
yo quiero tener el control 
quiero un cuerpo perfecto 
quiero un alma perfecta 
quiero que te des cuenta 
cuando yo no este por aqui 
eres tan especial 
desearia ser especial 

Pero soy extraño 
soy raro 
que demonios hago aqui? 
yo no pertenezco aqui 

Ella corre de nuevo 
ella sale corriendo 
ella corre, corre, corre, corre 
corre 

Cualquier cosa que te haga feliz

Jazmin Rivera	god i cant handle this anymore
Jazmin Rivera	I feel so hopeless. I love him so much, He’s so perfect, So beautiful in every way possible. His eyes are so pretty, pretty little almost slanted brown eyes. His eyebrows, so nicely shaped & full. His nose, My favorite feauture of all. There’s not one thing i don’t like about him, He’s everything to me, so fucking special. & to know that he already moved on so quickly means i’m not as special to him. I don’t want her to experience the happiness he gives, She’ll never love him as much as i do. She doesn’t deserve him. God please, return him to me.

Handsome Jack	WHAT A FUCKING SONG
Eee In the game	"HOLY SHIT THEYRE SO YOUNG. im a hardcore radiohead fan, listen to their Glastonbury show on loop, unironically play songs from their ""On a Friday"" days, learned Cut a Hole on guitar, etc., so if theres anyone who can say which Radiohead songs are good its me.

And this one is an absolute banger. Ive looped from ""wow this creep song is pretty good lol"" to ""wow i listen to their really obscure songs, and creep is for fake fans"" back to ""wow this creep song is pretty good lol"" again :) 

the only requirements for being a Radiohead fan is liking at least one (1) of their songs, and anyone gatekeeping is just being a prick."

Agama 55	I am a weirdo. I always used to hide it and it was basically my main characteristic. So my whole life thus far was me prtending to be someone I hated, that average kid who let people walk all over him. The only place I let myself free was when I wrote stories, long or short, and got lost in my own fantasies and worlds and characters. This continued until I met the most extraordinary people in my world. Around 11th grade I started to hang out with new people since my previous friend group was bland and boring and I soon learnt from these new people that it was okay to be a weirdo. Today, 3 years after meeting them, we're still friends and I can honestly say I love them. So I am a weirdo and I am glad to be one.

Fares Mesbeh	"I'm here because of a dream...
It was nice in a way, it made me feel loved for the first time in my life

It was about finding a girl, spent time with each other and we hugged for a long time so tightly that I started tearing up and she told me about this song
Then I woke up.
I really am looking for feel that hug once again, or just dream about it once again. I felt safe
Im kinda sad because the dream ended honestly but at least I felt loved, wanted and warm.."

Ghost Taste	"-LYRICS-
""Creep""

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

fizbinsfire	This song was my life once. I was with a woman who was so fuking special. I was the weird one. She had money, all her family and friends had money. I was poor my whole life and i didnt fit. We both were very broken people but our broken pieces fit together. Life was great when it was just us 2. The whole world dissolved away and there was just us. However life keeps goin on and we didnt stay broken forever. When that happened she no longer needed or wanted me and i really never fit in her world and she didnt want to be part of mine. I lost her the day i opened her eyes to that reality. We were living a lie. This song more than any says everything that needs to be said. She practically ran out the door and never looked back. So the truth set me free. Why didnt it bring me happiness? I was happier in the lie. I now know what the saying means. Ignorance is bliss. Now to play this song one more time and think of what could have been.

Eres tan jodidamente especial

Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco aqui

No me importa si duele
Quiero tener el control
Quiero un cuerpo perfecto
Quiero un alma perfecta
quiero que se den cuenta
Cuando no estoy cerca
Tan jodidamente especial
desearía ser especial

Pero yo soy un desgraciado
soy raro
¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco aqui

Ella está corriendo por la puerta (corre)
Ella se está acabando
Ella corre, corre, corre, corre
Correr...

Lo que te haga feliz
Lo que quieras

El_Brasuca	"*Lyrics*
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

scarfaceSPBRZ	It’s really deep and complex. Anyway is always hard. Being an outsider makes you feel like you were cursed  from the moment of your birth. Love can be also a damn curse.  Some people feel life like this, hardship comes from everywhere. People are strange, when you’re a stranger. Faces look ugly, when you’re alone.

Karb	This song is beautiful. I loved it when I was younger but coming back to it and listening to the words it really warms and breaks my heart. It puts into words how I often feel inside but can't find the words to say. I've been cheated on twice in both of my longest relationships and feel so broken and numb. This song really puts into perspective how I feel inside compared to others. It is beautiful, so heart breakingly beautiful it makes me shed tears.

Onukpa Jud	"Full lyrics

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Betty	Pov : Matt Helders zZZZ
Bruno Alves Coelho	The emotional axis of this song the last three or four sad songs I've heard has been curiously ironically shifted to a satiric tone. It is obscene as how everybody is doing this. This song is clearly superior to the last brasilian songs I've been hearing, but the voice and the instruments playing in an satiric tone is complicated. Don't get me wrong, my problem is with the sounds. I think it was a great move to put this guy who played the clitoris at the thorn song to play the guitar here. It makes the whole thing more artistic. But, if the sound is ruined all the heavy panning into making the images multiply the effect of the sound has an opposite effect.

El ChegueGwalas	"Sincerement, Radiohead m'a toujours fait chier, groupe mélancolique au possible, qui en a chier pour percer et je comprends pourquoi.
Radiohead est tout sauf un groupe de rock. S'aurait peu s'appeler les "" Tranxen 2000 "" que s'aurait été pareil.
Alors oui certainement certains morceaux sont magnifiques, mais c'est bon pour les dépressifs en manque de reconnaissance sociale ou sentimentale.
Désolé mais fallait que ça sorte 😤."

C.R	I know this song is about a guy falling for a girl he thinks is out of his league, but I like to look at it as someone on the fringes of society, someone who truely feels different and unique in all the wrong ways, unable to exist the way other people do. I'm autistic and I love interpreting the song this way because it makes me feel less alone.

Lheia Choi	I love his voice besides the lyrics . It's a somewhat tormented soul that is being portayed in here , sad , and wanting to be perfect . In reality , no one is perfect . We all have flaws , and what we can only do , is to try to improve what needs to be improve . We are all special in a very different unique manner .  All of us are born to be not a copy of anyone else out there .   lheia

Darth Vader	"what I like personally the most about this song is how different it is from most sad songs, but it isn't even that angry. It has a sense of quiet, burning but dampened energy and passion, feeling like the surface of a sun-scorched dwindling puddle of water, like someone who has gone through so much rage and jealousy and despair that he has given up on it all and continues on brokenly though you can feel the traces of that emotional power that had overloaded his circuits. Just the quick, pounding backbeat and heavy fuzz juxtaposed with the lugubrious lament of the vocals, the childishly simple and unpretentious lyricism almost shouting out that he doesn't know how to express his feelings to anyone anymore. This is a song of nuances and juxtaposed extremes, which swirl like the color patterns of those polychromatic marbles when you hold them out to the light.
This is the most poetic I have ever been. Yes, for a Radiohead review. Yes."
adiksadiatabs	Radiohead is so underrated

Naive	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather

I wish I was special
You're so ' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so ' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door

Dermacrosis	"Never be ashamed of being a creep, weirdo, freak, dirtbag, geek, etc, you are the ones who make the world interesting. Obviously as long as no one is being harmed, added due to a message sent to me so clarifying.  

After all normal is boring, it is one of the worst insults in my friends language and mine to call someone ""normal"". My first love was a skinny geeky weirdo, well he fancied me so...... ;-) but boy was he fun."

Btw, I absolutely loved this song so ridiculously much in the mid 90s.  This is the quintessential 90s anthem.  Not bad on your resume boys, learn to embrace it...
Ruslan Ihnatenko	Hi, 2021 like :)
Gabe Reiter	I’ve had low self-esteem throughout most of my life and every time I would listen to this song, my mind would be filled with suicidal thoughts.

Pero mientras no tenga el valor de hacer eso, seguiré escuchando creep"
brandi okeeffe	You're so fucking special...I wish I was special..2021.. I don't belong here....
Supa Dupa Swag	think of it this way. It's a double-edged sword. because you aren't codependent on looks, fame, or money, It amounted to you having the only path of changing your ways. Instant gratification is a privilege you don't have so your effort of fixing or having an outstanding relationship with people outside of those who go for the conventional outlook is what you are rewarded with. Have optimism guys.

Not out to harm anybody else. Just cannot go on without my beautiful parents and want to bring attention to those that see things they shouldn’t see as a full time carer to watch people who are your soul die in the most horrific way imaginable.

I would rather see if they are ok. Time to start the R1. My battle every day. If you feel you are alone you are not. I feel like you do ✌️"

Music for Minister Peacefulpoet	"Love is Love

You fall in love to whom you fall in love
Its out of your control
Your heart does what it do
People who tell you different
Just make believe and aren’t true
How can anyone in their right mind
Judge you
For who you fall in love to
Only those
Who never do
Never experience
What you do
If they did
They would know that you were true
There’s nothing you can do
They wouldn’t judge you
It would be okay
To be true
Then maybe we could investigate
Try to figure out
Why it is our heart does
What it do
We can know
Me and you
It can be okay
Too

Navid ul Islam khan Alvi	"E. maybe someday you will find this comment and notice (still daydreaming)
you were the best thing that ever happened to me.
I want to dedicate this song to you.

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye (because I was shy as F)
You're just like an angel (you still are I never found someone as amazing as you.)
Your skin makes me cry (you were so beautiful)
You float like a feather (because of your love you also made me float like a feather)
In a beautiful world (you made my world so beautiful that I had never imagined)
I wish I was special (I thought I was special because you choose me)
You're so fuckin' special (the day I met you I immediately knew you are a special person in my life plus you made all my insecurity disappear.)

But I'm a creep (but I always found myself not worth for you)
I'm a weirdo (still I am)
What the hell am I doing here? (what the hell I was doing with you)
I don't belong here (I dont belone with you I think Im not worth for you)

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control 
I want a perfect body (you had everything that I had dreamed of)
I want a perfect soul (until I met you I never saw someone so pure-hearted someone with so pure soul)
I want you to notice (I want you to notice how much I love you)

When I'm not around 


She's running out the door (when you said your feeling were fading away I was so scared that you might leave me)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy (but finally when you said you dont have any feelings for me anymore I didnt want you to leave but I didnt stoped you)
Whatever you want (I said if you wanna leave you can leave I wont stop you but I wanted to say I want you to stay with me forever)



all those days we had spent together were the best days of my life.
I know its been more than a year but my feelings for you are still the same. I tried to move on but I couldn't.
I still love you <3 .
whatever you do stay happy :)"

This song is about the girl Thom use to ""creep"" on because he was too shy to speak to her, one day he got drunk and built up the courage to talk to her but he ended up scaring her.

Kyle Bos	I dont think my friends like me anymore. We used to be super close hang out a lot tell each other who we liked and stuff or just talk about life. Now its different. I havent hung out with them in a while although prob do every weekend or so. And although i talk to a few of them regularly we never talk about anything real. Its always small talk that doesnt even matter. The sad thing is that i dont know what changed. One day they probably just said to each other “lets make a new chat so we can hang out, but not with him”. I dont know why they dont like me anymore though. I wish they would just tell me or something why and what happened

I would give him Minor Threat or Black Flag and he would give me Cannibal Corpse, or Gwar.

______________________________.
ตำนานวงร็อคแห่งเกาะอังกฤษ(วงนี้ก่อตั้งพอๆ กับอายุฉันเลยล่ะ).

ฉันได้ฟังเพลงนี้แล้ว..หวนคิดไปถึง ณ สมัยเรียน college in kl, malaysia.

ฉันเองชอบฟังแนวดนตรี rock เป็นพื้นฐานทุนเดิมอยู่แล้ว พอได้มาอยู่ไกลบ้าน พบปะสังคมเพื่อนพ้องฟังแนวดนตรีเดียวกันก็แค่ประเทศเพื่อนบ้านไทยเรานี่เอง แต่ความเป็นชาว rocker ยังคงเหมือนกัน เยเย้.

rock'90 วงนี้เป็นวงร็อคที่นิยมมากในสมัยฉันเรียนที่นั้น เพื่อนสายร็อคที่นั้นเปิดฟังกันบ่อยๆ สลับกับวงยุคเดียวกัน เช่น 3doors down.

*เพลง creep ให้อาลมล่องลอยไปในอากาศ(ฟินวนไปปป)"".

Finn McCool	"Slightly rewritten, from the girl's perspective, and a good bit darker:

If you were here before
Would've spit into your eyes
I'm not like an angel
I laugh when you cry
I look great in leather
On my beautiful curves

I know that I'm special
I love being special

But you're a creep
You're a weirdo
What the hell are you doin' here?
You don't belong here

And I hope that it hurts
I've got all the control
I've got a perfect body
You've got an ugly soul
I hope you're heart-broken
When I'm not around

I know that I'm special
But you aren't special

Cuz you're a creep
You're a weirdo
What the hell are you doin' here?
You don't belong here

Oh!  Oh!  HE'S CRAWLING OUT THE DOOR!
He's crawling out!
It's FUN!  FUN!  FUN!  FUNNNN!
FUNNNNNN!

I hope you're unhappy
Can't get what you want
I know that I'm special
But YOU aren't special

Cuz you're a creep
You're a weirdo
What the hell are you doing here?
You don't belong here...
You don't belong here."

When you pulled up to the club

Al principio no entendía por que lloraba por esa canción hasta que me tome el tiempo de escucharla bien y me di cuenta el por que :´v

Aynı senin varlığın gibi
Hislerin en güzeli
Ruhum aklından geçiyor
Aklım varlığından
Abarttukça abartıyorum
Ve beni sevmiyorsun

Oltamı evrene atıyorum bak 
Yine
İmkansızlığına denk gelirim diye"

Pineapple	Today I had a bad day. I was told something that truly didn’t matter but meant so much to me coming from someone who means so much to me. It about shattered me even though it is so unimportant. Everything about today went great and I would have had a great day if it weren’t for that. It’s childish of me to react how I did but I don’t know why I feel this way. I’ve just listened to this song 7 times on loop at max volume and don’t plan on stopping. I just want to sure up in bed with this playing and sleep for a week. I don’t know why my brain is like this but it is. I’m glad I grew up with my parents listening to stuff like this so I can enjoy the good music. I’m glad this song exists and I’m glad that tomorrow is a new day.

Богдана Ильницкая	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

Jon Smith	Surprised people haven’t tried to cancel this song...oh wait that’s right, Cancel Culture is a b*tch and needs to be stopped before they cancel everything and everyone for a small politically incorrect thing. A song like this that take about being a creep will eventually get cancelled, maybe in a year or maybe in 20 years but it will happen on day. It’s such a great song that it shouldn’t get cancelled and I’m pretty sure everyone who has liked the video as well  thinks they same, a song like this shouldn’t ever be cancelled.
Not Relevant	"Felt this way for awhile now, you'll get used to it, and if your so lucky to get it as a constant you'll even start to look forward to it

Gustav 489	"This is a great song but it is nowhere near the best Radiohead song. You might be annoyed that almost every Radiohead fan keeps on telling you to listen to their other songs but still. When I first heard this song I really liked it and then I said to myself ""wow Radiohead are good I will listen to some other songs by them"", I listened to the whole album of OK Computer and WOW. Radiohead instantly became my favorite band and Creep was not even in my top 100 favorite radiohead songs. I listened to all their albums and some b-sides and it was amazing. Radiohead is 100% my favorite band and I strongly recommend listening to other radiohead songs if you have not already."

No importa si duele,
quiero tener el control,
quiero un cuerpo perfecto,
quiero un alma perfecta,
quiero que tú te des cuenta
de cuándo yo no estoy a tu alrededor.
Eres tan tan especial,
desearía ser especial.


Pero yo soy un gusano,

I am from Ukraine, the city of Odessa on the Black Sea coast
I have a low level of English, but I just want to share my emotions.
Sorry for grammatical mistakes

This song fascinated me from the first listening It pierced my heart through and through with its sincerity and spiritual virginity, where there are no problems of cursing politics and other negativity She gives either tears or a smile or sadness ... I have one romantic moment associated with this song from life. I want to share it. 
It was to this beautiful song that I kissed my girlfriend for the first time.
I lit candles.
I turned on the neon lights.
LED garland lit up
When she entered the room, I took her hand and we slowly began to dance.
The scent of her perfume immediately filled my room with its scent
Our eyes met on a damn cool chorus.
I felt her soft breath, although I myself was worried like a little boy.
And when I asked her to close her eyes, I kissed her.
I felt goosebumps on her body.

So I saw her tears of happiness for the first time.
Thank you for this incredible and heartfelt song, Radiohead
If you have finished reading, then be happy. I hope you will be fine and you will find your happiness, and if you have happiness, take care of it. :)"

I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

zaytoun1er	"""The Air That I Breathe"" is a ballad written by Albert Hammond & Mike Hazlewood in 1972. 

1) 1972 • It is initially recorded by Albert Hammond on his album ""It Never Rains In Southern California"", released on 1972-08-16.  

2) 1973 • Philip Everly (from Everly Brothers) sings it on his album ""Star Spangled Springer"", released on 1973-01-31.   

3) 1974 • The Hollies cover, recorded after hearing Phil Everly's version, appears on their 14th UK studio album ""Hollies"" released in 1974.  

4) 1974 • The same year, James Last records an instrumental/orchestral version on his 1974 album ""Violins In Love"".  

5) 1975 • Olivia Newton-John performs it on her 1975 album ""Have You Never Been Mellow"".  

6) 1975 • A finnish version ""Tahdo en kuin hengittää vain"" written by Pertti Reponen, is released by Petri Pettersson.  

7) 1976 • Another curiosity, ""Comme Si"" is a french cover, with lyrics adapted by Bernard Droguet and sung by duo Shuky & Aviva.  

8) 1992 • The 1992 Radiohead song ""Creep"" uses a similar chord progression and shares some melodic content with the 1972 version of ""The Air That I Breathe"". Hammond & Hazlewood are given co-writing credits as well as a portion of the royalties.  

9) 2017 • ""Get Free"" is a song by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey from her 5th studio album, Lust for Life (2017). 
Nothing is clear concerning a link with 1992 ""Creep"" and/or 1972 ""The Air That I Breathe""...  🤔 

Numerous others artists have covered this song through years. 

All videos are on YouTube but I can't put the links here. 🤬 I had to remove them all... Otherwise my comment is deleted immediately. 🤷🏻‍♂️"

Sixtendc	Many years passed by. I’m sorry I know I can’t be part of your life but at least I can connect with you. My younger years were so cloudy like a dream but I can still see pigments of broken stained glass pieces that I’m trying to connect but years of memories that I can’t connect, it’s still pieces of the puzzle missing. I’m trying my best to enjoy life but the memories have woken me up. I remember how everyone just passed by as they didn’t care, flashes of lights that I seen in the corner of my eyes of people and places that I were part of my life. I feel like I’m in a time capsule and it’s taken years and years to release. Decades passed by and the memories are clear as the sky like it was just yesterday. It feels like I was living in a dream.

Kim Gelvin	This takes me back to the concert you did at the Palace in Melbourne,Australia in like 1994. Then I went to Sydney to hang out with Tim who was on tour with you all as a manager.  I actually was in a car with you guys after sound check with my friend Timmy. The only room was to sit on the ice in the boot  of the van but it was worth it cause you all sang Beatles songs on the way to your interviews after the concert. or was it before? I can't remember. Anyways, I loved being in your world for a weekend. You were so in the zone of being a creep too haha. Loved every minute of being in your world. Thanks Tim miss you. Even the five hour walk through Sydney since you refused to get in a cab at all. The Ritz was beautiful even though I spelt on the floor! love you guys!! XXXX Kimmy G

cherry me	I had this English teacher as my teacher in the music club, he was a sweetheart, he would always say that it was refreshing to see someone who had a ”zest for life”. I loved him so much, he would always make us smile because of how sweet and cute he was. A year later I was told by my other amazing English teacher that his wife and children were killed in a car accident that same year and he would still smile for us and be the sweetest and genuine person ever. He went to another city that year because he couldn’t hold it up anymore, memories of his family were everywhere, I tried to contact him but I couldn’t find a way to I regret not noticing and not being there for him when he needed the most. This song was his favorite and now that I heard the lyrics it breaks my heart so much. I just want to thank him and tell him how much his presence meant to me and other students, I will always keep him close to my heart.

潮田愛佳	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

前にきみがここに来たとき
目で見ることさえできなかった
きみは天使のようにきれいで
肌を見るだけでも泣けてくるほどだった

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
And I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

きみは美しい世界を舞う
鳥の羽のように浮かんでる
僕が何か特別な男だったらと願ったよ
きみは死ぬほど特別なひとだから

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

だけど僕はキモいヤツ
おまけに変わり者なんだ
僕はここで何やってるんだろう？
僕は場違いなヤツなんだ

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul

傷ついてもかまわない
自分の気持ちをコントロールしたいんだ
欠点のないからだがほしいし
いい性格な人間になりたいよ

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

僕のことを気付いてほしいんだ
いてもいなくても同じっていうのじゃなくて
きみは死ぬほど素敵だからさ
僕もそうありたいって思うけど...

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

でも僕はキモいから
そして変わり者なんだ
いったい僕はここで何をしてるんだ
僕はこんな場所に いていい存在じゃない

She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run

また 彼女が走って出て行くんだ
彼女は逃げ出してしまった
一目散に駆けて行ってしまった...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

きみが喜ぶのなら何だってするよ
きみが望むなら何だって
きみは死ぬほど特別なんだ
僕もそうありたいと願ってる...

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't belong here.

でも 僕はキモいヤツなんだ
変わり者のヘンなヤツさ
僕はここでいったい何ができるんだ？
場違いなヤツなのに
ここは僕のいる場所じゃないのに..."

Ricky 77333	"Romans 10
8 But what does it say? ""The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.""12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.""."

Adnan Moiz	"Mental health and the stigma attached to it need no introduction to the people who carry the burden. Some people carry the burden, keep it from others. I have decided to publish (in book form) some inspirational tales from such people.

I am collecting stories (single pager) from people who have suffered in the worst possible ways from depression and have tried to commit (or thought of) suicide. They can share their suicide notes, the story of how they have battled their way out and survived and ending with a smiling (inspirational) picture of theirs.

Currently, I am looking to connect with people who’re willing to contribute to this project! If you’re interested, please get in touch!!"

You were my idol.

Dimitris Apollonas Poseidonas Venetis	I was a teenager when this song came out living in Germany cologne. I loved it so much as it sounded very different and although I couldn’t understand English I could feel his grief. Now living in Australia and dealing with this doubtful virus, I am depressed, lack of sleep and hardly performing at work and sometimes I feel I completely failed in my life. I don’t want to meet new people, I m not interested in love or sex and sometimes I have panic attacks. I feel like I belong to nowhere. I accept things as they are. I don’t fight. I don’t resist. I feel safe only in my bedroom with the lights off and watching movies about love only. I miss the 90s living in Central Europe 😢 and travelling around the world. I wish happiness to all of you.

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a  beautiful world
I wish I was special
You 're so fucking special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special

Alexei Zinke	This was my older brother's favorite song, he was very introverted and pretty depressed. When he'd sing along you could really feel he felt this way. He died 9 years ago of a heart attack at 20 from an undiagnosed heart condition. His heart was literally 2.5x the size it should've been. He was the smartest, sweetest, most genuine person I've ever had the pleasure knowing. I ruined our relationship with my choices a few years before he passed. To get closure I dove Into all of his interests and favorite bands. Almost a decade later this song makes me bawl, I hear his voice when I hear this song. You weren't a creep Seth, and you belonged here, you deserved happiness and I'm so sorry I couldn't be closer with you before you died. Love and miss you everyday...

Richie	"That guitar riff is brutal. His voice is beautiful and angelic with a tinge of sadness, more than a tinge in fact. If you want a horror film, you watch the exorcist. If you want a wheel you make it round, If you want grunge you listen to this. It's the best. 
There are other grunge songs, but this is the only one. Being a weirdo was a bad thing before this amazing record but after this, it's the thing to be. What a record, incredible"

Lyrics

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

But I’m going to keep fighting like I always have. I just want to feel."

歌詞 / lyrics:

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run
Run…

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here"

You know what I really miss about you, seeing you happy and smile. When you were talking about your crystals to me and you were having a massive grin on your face, it gave me a feeling I cannot explain. You are pure in an impure world...I am pure I swear...I just fucked up that’s all, then messaging the other girl was another slip up I did. And from now on I’m going to stop slipping and start walking...start thinking about what I do and how it effects others around me...if you gave me another  chance, I’d take it and you wouldn’t regret it...I hope you don’t see this because it’s going to come across in a needy way and it’s not how I mean for it to be, I just really miss what we had and I just wanna be with you again...I’m so sorry for fucking up...thankyou for being there for me and thankyou for everything xxx

Melissa Rodriguez	Today is February 16 2021. Everyone at my school are having a whole ass glow up while I’m here just looking at how beautiful they are getting. I feel like I need to change myself because I feel like I’m going to be left out and be the ugly one at school. Back when I was in elementary school, I was so happy. In 7th grade, I was still happy and looked at myself in the mirror and thought I was so beautiful. Once I entered 8th grade, I started losing myself. I started sharing pics of my nude body to many people on the internet. I regret doing that so much. Even if I regret doing it, I still continued doing it. Now that I’m in high school, I hate myself even more. I really hope to find myself. I’m scared of myself and I want to run away from myself and never look at myself again. I really hope I can be happy again. I never knew I would turn out like this. My sister once told me “ You got so serious once you went to high school. I smile every time I see you happy”

ben h	I completely understand why they hate this song. It is overplayed, and the fact that people would leave their shows after they played it is messed up. However, that does not make this song bad. Karma Police is the best imo, and OK Computer is definitely their best album, but this one is amazing too.

M CH	"Cuando estuviste aquí antes,
yo no pude mirarte a los ojos.
Eres como un ángel,
tu piel me hace llorar.
Flotas como una pluma
en un mundo hermoso,
desearía ser especial,
tú eres tan malditamente especial.
Pero yo soy un desgraciado, 
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
No importa si duele,
quiero tener el control,
quiero un cuerpo perfecto,
quiero un alma perfecta,
quiero que tú te des cuenta
de cuándo yo no estoy a tu alrededor.
Eres malditamente especial,
desearía ser especial.
Pero yo soy un desgraciado,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
Ella otra vez se va corriendo,
ella se va corriendo, corre...
Lo que sea que te haga feliz,
cualquier cosa que quieras,
eres tan, tan especial.
Desearía ser especial,
pero soy un desgraciado,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar,
no pertenezco a este lugar."

Abel Vermont	"Es tarde y la oficina ya está vacía. De nuevo soy la última en salir... Nada de esto pasaría si tal día como hoy tuviera plan pero sigo sola, extremadamente sola. Es la noche de San Valentín y saber que no tengo a nadie esperándome en casa me desalienta. Agarro mi bolso de Prada —que comprarlo es lo que más feliz me ha hecho sentir últimamente— y voy directa a la planta baja. 
La calle está vacía. Parece que todo el mundo ha decidido darle la espalda a la soledad y por ende también a mí. Cojo el metro y me bajo en la segunda parada; me ha entrado un repentino ataque de pánico emocional. Decido que el resto del camino que queda hasta mi casa lo haré andando. La calle sigue vacía, los escaparates de las tiendas donde una vez comprábamos ropa juntos lucen llenos de excentricidades con mensajes evocadores que invitan a observarlos. Hay ositos de peluche con corazones incrustados en su pecho y una sonrisa de oreja a oreja; parecen estar riéndose de mí, de mi soledad, de mi hastío... De repente vuelvo a sentirme sola y miserable pero sigo mi camino para llegar lo antes posible. 
Al entrar en casa, mientras dejo las llaves en el cuenco de cristal que hay en la cómoda de la entrada, escucho un ruido extraño. Bueno, en cualquier caso, cabe señalar que, cuando vives sola, cualquier ruido que quede fuera de lugar resulta extraño. No me asusto porque después de todo llevo muchos años sola. Román se fue tan pronto...
Abro una botella de vino tinto para celebrar que mi pundonor vuelve a estar a salvo y me sirvo una copa hasta casi llenar el borde. Me siento en uno de los sillones que decoran con pulcritud mi salón. Otro ruido. No me asusto pero empiezo a inquietarme. ¿Me puede explicar alguien qué coño es eso? Después de varias copas de ese vino que he decidido no compartir con nadie descubro que me he quedado dormida. Siento como unos dedos invisibles comienzan a tocar mi cuello hasta bajar a los senos. Sé que me he dormido porque precisamente es esa sensación la que me despierta de golpe. La sensación invisible va bajando más y más hasta llegar a zonas que creía olvidadas. No sé qué está pasando e intento soltar un grito ahogado pero no puedo. Hay algo que me lo impide. Estoy asustada pero no quiero que pare. 
La micro cadena ha comenzado a funcionar de repente. Está sonando Creep de Radiohead y me quedo quieta, muy quieta. Mis ojos empiezan a llenarse de lágrimas y me doy cuenta de que el amante misterioso e invisible es Román. Esa era nuestra canción. Fue la canción que sonaba en el pub donde nos conocimos. Hace tanto tiempo que el destino quiso que no estuviera a mi lado nunca más... Bueno, el destino y el camión que chocó de frente contra su coche. Empiezo a llorar desconsoladamente recordándolo mientras nuestra canción sigue sonando. Me parece estar escuchándola en bucle. Siento las manos del amante invisible en mis mejillas como si quisiera secarme las lágrimas. 
Ahora ya no tengo miedo y no sé porqué estoy feliz. Después de todo Román nunca se fue de mi lado y creo que podré celebrar San Valentín con él una vez más.

Jonny Alex Guti 99	Every time I see this video, I remember the South Park episode in which Scott Tennorman is a Radiohead Fan he did evil to Erick Cartman, and in the end Erik Cartman has been making Scott Tennorman's parents kill and precisely when Scott was crying, the Radiohead band arrived and told Scott little girl and forbade Scott to go to his concerts, without a doubt this is the best episode I've seen of South Park

You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo

I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)

Talha Efe AY	"Every time i come back to this song, i think that i understand it, every time the meaning changes. Right now it doesn't even mean depression for me, i'm working my ass off to change, to make more money, to get better grades, to be more successful, i'm hitting the gym constantly. I'm slowly getting addicted to ritalin and most of my days feel like straight up hell but ""i don't care if it hurts, i want to have control""."

Omar Sanchez	Is not that the song might sound depressing , the artist sings it with all his heart probably thinking of his own life experiences. Bad life experiences in my opinion give birth to great comedians and great music artists.

Leo Saturn	I had a crush on this one girl. she was special to me though. but the thing is, I kept it a secret for so long and never told her. I would do anything and everything at the time just to see her.. I wanted to change myself for her. I cut my hair, dressed masculine, but she still didn't look my way. I would gaze at her with a pit in my stomach knowing we could only stay friends. I felt like a creep for feeling like that towards her. she liked another guy, similar to my looks but, he was taller slim, and handsome. I cried in silent and our whole friendship was built on my ignorant bliss.  I was just a girl to her.

BlazeSenpai	Everytime i listen to this song its getting better and better......❤
Chungle Fungle	It’s a shame this is their most popular song, the rest of their discography is more eerie, more sad, and gives the feeling that this gives but intensified. This song was like Nirvanas: Smells like Teen Spirit. Not their favourite, but their most commercially popular. All I’m saying is Radiohead has not made a bad album, except Pablo Honey, Fuck Pablo Honey.
Aleggy	From me to my hetero crush :(
Fernanda Ramalho	Viciada a 💯

G Snipe	Very recently, I have become obsessed with Radiohead. Listening to their whole discography on repeat. I wish I was joking. I don’t know if being a literal “Radiohead” has been for the better or for worse, but after days worth of listening to Radiohead I still STILL come back to this song. It is one of the very few in the world I consider perfect.

KazTheHero 505	Okay, This song is played out to much. But I love it. It fits me.  I'm in high school and trying to reconnect with a pair of twins I haven't talked to in years. We've grown since then but the didn't change at all. But because of my social anxiety, it's hard to try and talk to them.  I would occasionally run into them because of a weird coincidences, I have classes right across the hall from the at nearly all times! I know You guys might think i'm just being a wuss, but no matter how hard I think about these coincidences, I think I'm tailing them. Or stalking them. I do know where they go, and what they do, but that is unintentional. Because of my paranoia, I doubt my own sanity. I still haven't talked to them.

Steer Wheel	got to comment more.  Who ever done the camera work and editing. This was an astounding work. Incredible lighting angles. I am not any kind of expert. But as a ordinary viewer. The close up shots and the lighting effects, the shadowing, knowing the precise times and places to zoom in and out. Even the audience shots. The close up of the woman looking into the camera. The floating hands of worship, the close up of his eyes shut and open. Was this pot smoke rising up to the stage ? Maybe, maybe not. In my young days it would have been. I have watched this dozens of times in a row. I love the start showing those first great notes picked on the guitar.

Steer Wheel	Blown away. i just heard this on the radio for the first time. i looked it up here. I am stunned at this performance ! This is incredible to me.

Mr Reindeer	I saw these at Brixton Academy in 1996 (or was it 7?). A perfect end to an amazing day in London with people I love - not the band; those I was with. I even got to marry one of them, eventually. There was a bizarre inflatable installation at Clapham Common we visited that same afternoon. We had to wear tunics and got told off for running through the dimly lit air tunnels.  Too much fun can never be had!

As catchy as the beat is, the lyrics are what truly makes this song good.

Saat kau di sini
Couldn't look you in the eye
Tak bisa kulihat matamu
You're just like an angel
Kau seperti bidadari
Your skin makes me cry
Kulitmu buatku menangis
You float like a feather
Kau melayang seperti bulu
In a beautiful world
Di dunia yang indah

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was special
Aku berharap aku istimewa
You're so fuckin' special
Karena kau sangat istimewa

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
Namun aku hanya pengganggu, aku orang aneh
What the hell am I doing here?
Apa yang kulakukan di sini?
I don't belong here
Aku tak sepantasnya disini

[Verse 2]
I don't care if its hurts
Aku tak peduli apakah ini menyakitkan
I want to have control
Kuingin pegang kendali
I want a perfect body
Kuinginkan tubuh yang sempurna
I want a perfect soul
Kuinginkan jiwa yang sempurna
I want you to notice
Kuingin kau perhatikan
When I'm not around
Saat aku tak ada

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so fucking special
Kau sungguh sangat istimewa
I wish I was special
Aku berharap aku juga istimewa

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
Namun aku hanya pengganggu, aku orang aneh
What the hell am I doing here?
Apa yang kulakukan di sini?
I don't belong here
Aku tak sepantasnya disini

[Bridge]
She's running out again
Dia lari lagi
She's running out
Dia lari
She's run run run
Dia lari

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Apapun yang buatmu bahagia
Whatever you want
Apapun yang kau inginkan
You're so fucking special
Kau sungguh sangat istimewa
I wish I was special
Aku berharap aku juga istimewa
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
Namun aku hanya pengganggu, aku orang aneh
What the hell am I doing here?
Apa yang kulakukan di sini?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
Aku tak sepantasnya disini"

Menéndez Ventura Erubey	"cambien la letra por esta:
 Con cuerno de chivo y bazuka en la nuca
Volando cabezas al que se atraviesa
Somos sanguinarios locos bien ondeados
Nos gusta matar
Pa dar levantones somos los mejores
Siempre en caravana, toda mi plebada
Bien empecherados, blindados y listos
Para ejecutar
Con una llamada privada se activan
Los altos niveles, de los aceleres
De torturaciones, balas y explosiones
Para controlar
La gente se asusta y nunca se pregunta
Si ven los comandos, cuando van pasando
Todos enfierrados, bien encapuchados
Y bien camuflash
Van endemoniados, muy bien comandados
Listos y a la orden, pa hacer un desorden
Para hacer sufrir y morir a los contras
Hasta agonizar
Van y hacen pedazos, a gente a balazos"

Diego González	If this would only come back. Be played in every radio station and have humanity return to the right track. With these songs, with rock, we knew we had a long unknown future, that amazing things were waiting for us in the future, technology and all those things.

Couldn't look you in the eye

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,

Whatever you want

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

J Ray	Not that anyone will care, but I find it interesting that Thom is using a Fender guitar strap.  It is identical to the one that came with the Strat that I bought in the '90s.  I guess at the time Fender was just including it with all of their mid-line to upper-line instruments.  I would have thought that Thom would have used something aftermarket, I guess is what I'm getting at.

What the hell am I doin' here?

I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts

I wanna have control

I want a perfect body

I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice

When I'm not around

So fuckin' special

I wish I was special

But I'm a creep

I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doin' here?

I don't belong here

She's running out the door (run)

She's running out

She run, run, run, run,

Run...

Whatever makes you happy

Whatever you want

You're so fuckin' special

I wish I was special

What the hell am I doin' here?

I don't belong here

I don't belong here"

Ms. Emarem	"1 Timothy 2:5-6
5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time.

𝐉𝐄𝐒𝐔𝐒 𝐂𝐇𝐑𝐈𝐒𝐓 𝑜𝑓 𝑁𝑎𝑧𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑡ℎ,  fully GOD, fully Man ⁽ᵇᵒʳⁿ ᵒᶠ ᵀᴴᴱ ᴴᴼᴸʸ ˢᴾᴵᴿᴵᵀ ᵃⁿᵈ ᵒᶠ ᴹᵃʳʸ ᵗʰᵉ ᵛᶦʳᵍᶦⁿ⁾ and sinless, walked on earth, performing miracles and many wonders proving HIS deity, died a bloody death on the Cross for our sins. Without JESUS CHRIST dying for you and me, we were sentenced to the death penalty of eternal separation from CHRIST, and HELL, which was a place prepared for the Devil and his angels. It is a fiery pit full of blackness and darkness, gnashing of teeth, eternal torment and punishment. In other words, YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO THERE...but that is the sentence that we all deserved because the wages of sin is death. GOD came up with a Master plan to save us and give us REDEMPTION through 𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙇𝙊𝙍𝘿 𝙅𝙀𝙎𝙐𝙎 𝘾𝙃𝙍𝙄𝙎𝙏. And CHRIST took our sins on HIS own body, receiving the punishment and wrath of GOD which was due to us. So our sins were imputed on HIS body at the CROSS, and HE died, was buried in a tomb which was sealed off, and resurrected on the 3rd day seen by Peter and then 12 disciples, over 500 witnesses, James HIS brother and the Apostles, HE ascended up into Heaven before many to sit at the Right Hand of THE FATHER in Heaven. This means that GOD accepted HIS sacrifice on the Cross for our sins. Which means that when JESUS CHRIST returns, we will be caught up with HIM and have immortality with HIM, back in fellowship as it was in the Beginning of Creation, in HIS PRESENCE, seeing HIM face to face, know HIM as we are known by HIM. No hatred, crime, wickedness in sin. No more tears, no more pain, perfect peace and Harmony with OUR GOD THE FATHER, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, HIS HOLY SPIRIT. No one else but JESUS CHRIST could die for our sins, because HE was sinless and perfect. So when we believe in JESUS, we are no longer on death row, we are spared from the death penalty and JESUS CHRIST, and HIS Righteousness is credited to us. 

Acts 4:11-12 
11 This is the ‘stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.’ 12 Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”

""Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.""

Proverbs 28:13
He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.

Psalm 86:5 
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

Romans 10:8-13 
8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

Ezekiel 33:11 
11 Say to them: ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?’

Isaiah 55:6-8
Seek the Lord while He may be found,
Call upon Him while He is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way,
And the unrighteous man his thoughts;
Let him return to the Lord,
And He will have mercy on him;
And to our God,
For He will abundantly pardon."

Erick Cabanillas	Heartbrokens 2020??
Joel WiLLiam	Tears, smiles, dreams, kisses, and screams, the wide realm of depth in emotion, the chaotic variation clearly evident, the love, the pain, the honor, envy, malice, and violence.  You can see it when a child laughs, feel it, when you hold your lover, it tastes like breathing, and tho it is nothing, it is all things at the exact same happening.  Who we are, what we were, who we may become destin to be, to merely do something, be someone, never is it ever enough, believe in your risen, embracing empathy of the fallen, only looking back when you crave memory of lessons burned, loved ones like treasures hurried in boxes decorated in the flowering spring, while the sun sets on the aftermath, the moon mourns of the wretched, and the stars forever wishing in the hearts of the young, oblivious of the soul crush that awaits their fragile porcelain like hearts, in the not so distant confusion of this the spinning zoo, our free to tumble rock, that picture perfect portrait of an american tragedy.  Living, breathing, Loving, deceiving, whying the crying, leaving, the dying, as the dreaming, continues, surviving.

When you are the creep and weirdo and in love with a beautiful popular girl, your so afraid to talk to her! Every move you make by her, you think is stupid! You lay in bed at night, just wishing you could be popular, or one like her so she would notice you! In the long run, it never works out! But you think to yourself, maybe its better that way! I love this song!

Sergio Rojas	Esta canción ni siquiera la considero de Radiohead. Ni la tengo en mis listas de Rock ni del Grupo. A pesar de que es posiblemente mi grupo favorito es como si la canción no existiera. Llegué aquí por el autoplay de google.
Alexandre Lisboa	This song reminds me an europeian summer love I've had when I was 19 years old. German 35 yeras old guy, we left a nighclub in Koln and were going to subway, there was a choral group singing this song, sitting on the floor, having some wine. Unforgettable!

EliasMsv	I know this isn't the best Radiohead has made but it's really good
Ena Devoto	Bob dylan advised his favorite decade of music was the 90's. I feel the late 60's early 70's was a gold mine of music. The 80's was getting lost and depend soley on aesthetics and not lyrics. Then the late 80's early 90's music changed the course structure of music. Grunge was a product of it's time. I am hoping that another artist captivate the world and mainstream rock again. I can't stand this new music because they try to be provocative in nature but it just doesn't rely on the music composition anymore. We need another Elvis,  Beatles or Nirvana. Instead we have guys who tattoo their face and mumble their way to stardom. This must be the lowest standard we endured. We lowered our standard because it provide us with a false perception of reaching stardom and becoming famous. I have hope for the younger generation and wish to be alive to witness a rock and roll revival that invoke feeling and thoughts not soley depending on aesthetics.
Tug Speedman	Wow, my only real knowledge of Radiohead is from the Scott Tenorman South Park episode. Which I'm watching now & decided to actually check them out and again, wow! This was truly terrible. The poorest man's Nirvana, except no talent anywhere.

Eslin Producciones Perú	Tremendo tema😎
Fatima Jaimez	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

DooDoo Poop	The only problem I’ve ever had with Radiohead as people, is their public dismissal of this track. Guys, WE ALL know you’ve moved on musically. We are all still fans whatever direction you go. This should be a curtain call track at EVERY SHOW. No shit.....you may not like it, but its something to a lot of people who buy all your music multiple times on every format.

Pedro Domingos	Thought they were Muse😜
Germano Cavalcante	Em algum momento todo mundo sente essa dor independente de quem ou o que a causou, do grau único e da quantidade  de recaídas se essa sensação vez por outra volta. Ninguém tem culpa de ser ferido, deformado ou até humilhado tanto o corpo como na mente e se sentir assim com  falta de amor próprio devido a circunstâncias que só você mesmo pode entender. Essa é uma canção bela e realista que me faz calar e viajar de um forma intensa em meus pensamentos turbulentos.

El Turcos	"Can't you see I'm trying?

Is this it?

Is this it?

Is this it?



Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted

When they lied, I knew it was just stable children

Trying hard not to realize I was sitting right behind them



Oh dear, can't you see? It's them it's not me

We're not enemies; We just disagree

If I was like them all pissed in this bar

He changes his mind, says I went too far

We all disagree

I think we should disagree, yeah



Is this it

Is this it

Is this it



Can't you see I'm trying?

I don't even like it. I just lied to

Get to your apartment, now I'm staying

Here just for a while

I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired"

Enthusiastic Gamer	"What point is life anymore. I've been born with Aspergers syndrome and by societal standards I'm another defect. Humanity needs to be ended, God fucked up creating us. I tried to fit in and I have friends and people I know don't try and people like me might as well eventually end our lives. What meaning is there when some people like me get trauma, verbal abuse and pain.

God is a dick who needs to be dethroned, I'd do a better job as creator and make all humans suffer the way I have. Whenever humans wouldn't learn they're life lesson I'd reincarnate them over and over till they learned their life lessons."

Alexis Joyce	"3 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Also, for everyone resonating with the song; trust me. You  are special. Those who don't think they're special are often some of the coolest people ever. I had a friend who was convinced he was a nobody. I was so shocked. Because  I saw so much beauty, so much passion within him. Try to look at yourself in a new light. You're better than you think."

Rafly Stiansah Latif	There's this girl that I've known for years. We were good friends, but for some reason one day I just started falling very hard for her, even though she already had a boyfriend, and her boyfriend is also one of my best friends. I had a fight with my own best friend because I liked his girlfriend and it really ruined our relationship hard, but i told both of them that I was over it so they can stay together. The truth is, i never really do. After we finished school, she left the city for a higher education. That was 3 years ago, and I've had 2 relationships that fell apart because I can't stop thinking about her when it comes to girls. About a year ago, she came back to my city, and i figured out her arrival time by checking out what plane she was on. I went to the airport just to see her arrive and just watched from the distance when she came down the plane and picked up her baggage. After that I went home while making sure she never saw me and just almost broke up crying over how pathetic I was. Around the same time I found this song, and it felt really good to have something to relate to because I never really tell anyone about this. And now here I am, still thinking about her all the time, but only to appreciate all the good old times we had together, even if it was just as friends, and stopped imagining about what we could have been

I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Josenk	"Esta cancion nos muestra un nivel de auto-estima bajo en el protagonista de la historia y una sobre-estimacion hacia la persona a la que va dedicada.
Posiblemente depresion; desde mi punto de vista, una persoba con depresion teme emfrentar el problema  y se culpa a si mismo y a la gente cercana a el, sin admitir que puede solucionar el problema de forma mas sencilla de lo que cree. Por lo tanto esta cancion podria interpretarse como el protagonista admitiendo su disgustó en modo de vos grito en vos baja, pero sigue culpandoce asi mismo por ""no estar a la altura"" de traer persona. O almenos asi lo veo yo.
En conclusion si sientes que77 tienes depresion o baja auto-estima deberias enfrentar tu problema aunque paresca difícil  (obviamente no conozco tu situación pero si no te afecta a largo plazo te recomiendo hacerlo) y/o ir a un psicólogo."

In a beautiful pea green boat
I wish you were gay
You're so last summer

But I'm dummy thicc
I'm a banana
What the hell did i just read
I dont like mondays

I don't care about your safety
I wanna be tracer
I want a perfect credit score
I want a divorce
I want you in Spanish
When do babies creep
You're so last summer
I wish you were gay

But I'm dummy thicc
I'm a banana
What the hell did i just read
I don't like mondays"

His times were fun, where everybody automatically knows how to play the drums and guitars and hears punk rocks and songs like Creep and even AudioSlave let alone Nirvana, Greenday and etc. I wouldn't say my generation suck and I do have a band but I really do wish I was around my dad's time.

Donovin Dickerson	"My son was born in the morning today, November 24th. Late on the night before, he rocked out in his mothers womb to this song and kicked like crazy. He is less than 24 hours old, and I'm sitting in the hospital holding him and playing this song. 

He is going to grow up to be quite the badass. I'll introduce him to symphonic sounds in Metallica's music next to rock out to 🎸. He will hear many types of music of all sounds and genres. Even tribal/viking music. But, knowing how this little guy was in the womb with Rock n Roll. Guitars is where his preference is mostly going to stay.

 Thought this song was cool to introduce him into the world with, since he liked it right before birth. Keep the future generations rocking!!

Rock On!! I'm one proud father!! 🎸 🤘"

Rainer Zufall	EPIC.
Roidxn	I haven't felt anything after she got high asf with that guy, then slept with him. I don't know how to feel anymore. Is this what I'll look back to in my high school years? how broken I became with the mentality of overthinking the littlest things? No one does that. Will this lonely world without siblings, friends, and any certain love seclude me farther into the depths of the earth? Let me get tf out of here, take me to Mars, take me to your  room to leave the one i'm in right now, let me open that door. Let me out of here, I want to get out, now, leave me now.
BearMan	I love it

On January 27, 25 days after our trip, he died. My world collapsed, but I survived. There is no way that this song did not mark one of the happiest moments we spent together. To you Márcio! ♥*

manuel rodriguez	No se si alguien leerá esto pero está canción me recuerda a el primer gran amor de mi vida... Era una chica que vivía atrapada en el cuerpo de un chico. Nos conocimos desde la secundaria y fuimos nuestros primeros novios y otras cosas. Luego nos distanciamos y volvimos a tener contacto hace tres años donde tuvimos una hermosa relación de amistad hasta hace un año que se fue a vivir a otro lado. Yo la amo pero no he sabido más de ella porque ella me pidió que no la buscará porque me amaba pero no quería lastimarme. Aun espero que está pandemia termine para ir a verla pero recuerdo que si nuevo nombre será Angel porque me dijo que le gustaba está canción. Creo que ambos hemos hecho vidas separadas pero me alegra saber que una persona tan perfecta vio belleza en un fenómeno como yo.

But I'm a creep

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Moune Elle	"100 Reasons Why You Should Stay Alive 

1. Your friends, your family, and your pets would miss you.

2. It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. 

3. It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. 

4. There's so much you would miss out on doing. 

5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there. 

6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. 

7. You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. 

8. You are amazing. 

9. A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better. 

10. What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead. 

11. I love you. Platonically. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive. 

12. You won't be able to listen to music if you die. 

13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about. 

14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me. 

15. You're preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born. 

16. How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died? 

17. You're gorgeous, amazing, handsome, and to someone you are perfect. 

18. Think about your favourite music artist, you'll never hear their voice again... 

19. You'll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day. 

20. Listening to incredibly loud music.

21. Being alive is just really good. 

22. Not being alive is really bad. And boring.

23. Finding your soulmate. 

24. Red pandas. Just… THEY ARE SO CUTE!!

25. Going to diners at three in the morning. 

26. Really soft pillows. Or blankets.

27. Eating pizza in New York City. 

28. Proving people wrong with your success. Take that!

29. Watching the jerks that doubted you fail at life. Take that!

30. Seeing someone trip over a garbage can.

31. Being able to help other people. 

32. Bonfires. 

33. Sitting on rooftops. 

34. Seeing every single country in the world. And not being ignored. Because, y’know, if you were dead everyone would run into you… it would suck.

35. Going on road trips. Have fun doing that as a ghost, or whatever.

36. You might win the lottery someday, who knows! How would you enter while you’re dead?!

37. Listening to music in your own special place.

38. Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, staring down at everyone with the wind in your hair.

39. Taking really cool pictures.

40. Literally meeting thousands of new people.

41. Hearing crazy stories. 

42. Telling crazy stories.

43. Eating ice cream on a hot day with your best friends.

44. More interesting books or episodes could come out, you never know. It’s gonna be hard to get books or watch Netflix/Hulu/Etc while you’re dead.

45. Travelling to another planet someday. It’s gonna happen.

46. Having an underwater house.

47. Randomly running into your hero on the street

48. Having your own room at a fancy hotel.

49. Trampolines.

50. Think about your favourite movie, you'll never watch it again.

51. Think about the feeling of laughing out loud in a public place because your best friend has just sent you an inside joke.

52. Your survival will make the world better, even if it's for just one person or 20 or 100 or more. 

53. People do care. 

54. Treehouses, you won’t really be able to have a treehouse while dead.

55. Hanging out with your soulmate in a treehouse 

55. Snorting when you laugh and not caring who sees. 

56. I love you. Platonically.

57. I care about you. 

58. Because nobody is going to be like you ever, so embrace your uniqueness! 

59. You won't be here to experience the first cat world emperor. You won’t even be influenced by it.

60. WHAT ABOUT FOOD?! YOU'LL MISS CHOCOLATE AND ALL THE OTHER NOM THINGS!

61. Starbucks. Or caribou coffee.

62. Hugs. The kind that makes you squeal because of how tight they are, the kind that you really love. 

63. Stargazing with your favourite person in this universe at 4am because you can’t sleep, the grass brushing against your toes as you snuggle together.

64. You have a purpose, and it's up to you to find out what it is. 

65. You've changed somebody's life. 

66. Now you could change the world. 

67. You will meet the person that's perfect for you. Maybe you already have.

68. No matter how much or how little, you have your life ahead of you. 

69. You can’t look at any more memes if you're dead.

70. If you end your life, you're stopping yourself from achieving great things.

71. Making snow angels. 

72. Making snowmen. 

73. Snowball fights. 

74. Life is what you make of it. 

75. Everybody has a talent. 

76. Laughing until you cry, with your stomach screaming and your lungs flaring in heat. Rolling on the floor, grinning ear to ear.

77. Having the ability to be sad means you have the ability to be happy. 

78. The world would not be the same if you didn't exist. 

79. It’s possible to turn frowns upside down. 

80. Be yourself, don't take anyone's crap, and never let them take you alive. 

81. Heroes are ordinary people who make themselves extraordinary. Be your own hero. 

82. Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect. It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections. 

83. One day your smile will be real. It will, I promise you.

84. Having a really hot, relaxing bath after a stressful day. 

85. Lying on grass and laughing at the clouds. 

86. Laughing insanely hard with your best friends. 

87. Eating weird food. 

88. Staying up all night watching your favourite films with a loved one. 

89. Sleeping in all day. 

90. Creating something you're proud of. 

91. You can look back on yourself 70 years later and being proud that you didn't commit. And if you did, feeling regret that you did.

92. Being able to meet your Internet friends. 

93. Coffee.

94. The new season of your favourite show. 

95. Staying up late with your best friend.

96. Being stupid in public because you just can. 

97. If you are reading this then you are alive! Is there any more reason to smile? 

98. Being able to hug that one person you haven’t seen in years 

99. People care enough about you and your future to come up with 100 reasons for you not to do this. 

100. But, the final and most important one is just being able to experience life. Because even if your life doesn't seem so great right now, literally anything could happen.


I didn't come up with these but it don't make it less important. Just remember to smile at life and to be grateful of every little things happening in your life, have a great day : )"
Mariska Delaere	"I've been a crazy Radiohead fan for years now
Their music has been by my side every step of the way 
The music and lyrics spoke to me 
because I could relate to so much of it

They are my heart and I love them

Marcos Diniz	"I""m a weirdo ,but you so fucking special"
SI TR	"To me this song is clearly about a boy/man that is not confident enough to approach a girl/woman that he likes BUT I also get this undertone of this girl also being a bit of a bitch. The lyric that really sticks out to me is ""You're so fucking special"". Why the fucking? It makes the statement sound sort of sarcastic. I think what is trying to be conveyed here is that the girl is in fact not special whatsoever and only views herself as special. IDK, maybe I am reading into it too much but that lyric really sets a tone for me. Love the song."

Sandi Ami	10-24-2020 Hearing this song with the original singer for the 1st time ever. Heard it on AGT with Brian 4yrs. ago and I was going to look it up because I didn’t know who sung it but never did until now. I usually or better say I never listen to this type of music but for some odd reason I keep listening to it. The lyrics just makes me feel compassion for someone that is feeling this way and the singer has a great voice. Can’t stop listening. I’ve heard about Radiohead before but I had never heard not even one song of theirs. Wow!!!

Ricardo Mancera Torres	"...SONG OF THE DAY!!!
RADIOHEAD - CREEP (1993)
Sin duda alguna, el sentimiento de melancolía (qué incluso raya en lo depresivo) que imprimió esta gran bNd, permite a las generaciones futuras seguir disfrutándola, en la letra encontraremos la descripción perfecta de una mujer muy hermosa. Ella contrasta de manera drástica con la forma de ser y apariencia del protagonista. Es aquí donde surge la trama de la historia. El hombre se describe a sí mismo como una persona RARA/DESAGRADABLE. Eso no le permitirá jamás acercarse a su hermosa mujer IDEALIZADA (y que no significa que detrás de esa ""belleza"" también encontremos imperfecciones). Y es que para la ""sociedad"" el simple hecho de ser ""distinto” a los demás lo hace ""MALO"", sin embargo y cómo bien dicen: ""LA REALIDAD ES IDÉNTICA AL PENSAMIENTO SOBRE ELLA"".🤘🏿ULTRAMEGAROLOTA🤘🏿"

Мне все равно, если это больно
I don't care if it hurts

Я хочу контролировать
I wanna have control

Я хочу идеальное тело
I want a perfect body

Я хочу идеальную душу
I want a perfect soul

Я хочу, чтобы ты заметил
I want you to notice

Когда меня нет рядом
When I'm not around

el colito	"Unrequited love inspired Beethoven to write his finest gift to the world - Moonlight Sonata. Hang on in there. The darkest hour is always the one just before dawn.
El amor no correspondido inspiró a Beethoven a escribir su mejor regalo al mundo: Moonlight Sonata. Aguanta ahí. La hora más oscura es siempre la que precede al amanecer.
No sufran por una persona que no puede sentir amor por alguien que simplemente lo ama, yo vivi el amor no correspondido y creanme que la persona que me gustaba tanto, luego de años, cuando me dejo de gustar pude darme cuenta lo que era... (una basura), no idealicen, muchas veces les gusta tanto esa persona porque le atribuyen cosas que no tiene :)."

Yodel Odelstein	Wow, music has come so far. Never heard of them but based on the comments they were a major band back in the day.  Just shows the evolution- they probably couldn’t compete against an average garage band today with the advances in computers and instruments. Just amazing.  Bands like Coldplay and Imagine Dragons, along with envelope pushing artists like NLE Choppa and Tom Macdonald have just taken things like 5 levels up. Gotta give respect to the olden days though, they knew how to put on a show despite not having modern equipment or techniques. Most kids in my class won’t listen to anything before like 2015, but I think there is value in at least listening to classics. It might not actually be good music, but it played an important role, IMO, in what the guys today are able to do. I can see where a band like Maroon 5 was able to take stuff, like this lead singers high vocals, and really master it, incorporate it into their music, but cut out all the garbage and craft truly great songs.  This band might never have made it, or left a mark, but it doesn’t make them a failure. Thanks to things like YouTube pieces of their, and other obscure bands, music will live on in at least a small way.

I want a perfect soul

I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special

Rizwan Tahir	"When this song came out I was a shy man, travelled the world had my fare share of relationships with women, 

Moved around, got wasted on a few occasions, finished my masters, did professional jobs, became a teacher,  consultant ....... The only bad habit left I guess is smoking and listening to all these rock bands of the wild days gone by.
 49 today, still listenin, oh by the way on the journey learned how to play the guitar as well"

I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want

Alejandro Poveda Vanegas	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

a6 od	anyone come here because of lucifer on netflix?
Nicholas Allen	M8 honestly this song makes you feel emotions you didn't even know you had
Elixir Piyush	"This song made me realize that being a creep is not actually bad. I am a creep, but so are you and everyone else, just in the eyes of different people.  I'm not talking about the pedophile, stalker, molester or those kinky shit kinda creep.. but you know, feeling like a creep for being ignored, ditched, left out, maybe for being different.. it's okay to be a creep. You do belong here. What good does it do when you don't do something you wanna do (as long as it doesn't hurt someone else that is)? The next guy won't even remember you after a week or so, but you? You will be left feeling like shit for the rest of the life just because you didn't do something you should have done. Accepting (and if you need to, improving yourself ) is what matters I guess... If we do find ourselves acting like, or being treated like a creep, we change ourselves for the better. We're all human beings. I could have been a creep for someone but it doesn't make me a freak in general, does it? 
I dunno if it makes sense 🤔 Just felt like it might help someone."

Can Man	Every day, living alone. No friends, no family. Nobody. You just eat, study go home and maybe lift that day. Living trapped in my homeschooled home from 13-18 gaining a hundred plus pounds only to become optimistic from my isolation and lose the weight. Now I'm 20 and productive but very alone and sad. Sad music like this allows you to empty your brain from the negatives and try and overcome, atleast for me.
Oreo Gon	It is so nice to know that people still go back to this song. Cheers everybody

""The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.""."

When you were here before

Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

I'd be honored if some 90s-era Radiohead fans would take a quick listen to my acoustic piano & vocal YT performances of HIGH & DRY and ""1979"" by the Smashing Pumpkins in tribute to 2 of the most iconic 90s bands.

Javier Bustos	"Nunca te olvides de esta canción. 


Cuando estuviste aquí antes,
yo pude mirarte a los ojos.
Eres como un ángel,
tu piel me hace llorar.
Flotas como una pluma
en un mundo hermoso,
desearía ser especial,
tú eres tan especial.
Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
No importa si duele,
quiero tener el control,
quiero un cuerpo perfecto,
quiero un alma perfecta,
quiero que tú te des cuenta
de cuándo yo no estoy a tu alrededor.
Eres tan tan especial,
desearía ser especial.
Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.
Ella otra vez se va corriendo,
ella se va corriendo, corre...
Lo que sea que te haga feliz,
cualquier cosa que quieras,
eres tan, tan especial.
Desearía ser especial,
pero soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar,
no pertenezco a este lugar.

MAYRA GISEL NAZARENA MEYER."

 재생 목록	"2020 Anyone listening ?

Don't know why I feel sad being single for my entire 24 years in life...... I read several hundred books, got a CPA professional degree,  a job, Mensa membership, chess Masters club, hike countless mountain, became martial art black belter,  established businesses, created my own mobile app, website and currently writing a book... and still I am single....... ""am I a CREEP""? .
this song reminds me that  ""I don't belong here"" , in this world....for being physically unattractive,  despite my IQ, EQ and accomplisments?

I'm losing inspiration to live....and  this song kinda reminds me how it's like to live like a creep, make me feel understand even for a bit.
Does anyone here feel this way too?
How do you deal with it?
Please let me know how do you deal with isolation

Chee Chee	Reminds me of my PTSD.. it’s a creep. “Your skin makes me cry” all the abuse I went threw. “I’m a creep” makes me feel like I don’t deserve anyone because I was abused and still am for something I can’t control, for something THEY caused. “I wanna have control” I want control. For once in my life. I want to be able to go out, not need a fucking service dog by me, and just go out longer then 2 hours. My service dog is a bandaid to this. She helps em daily but it won’t be forever. “I don’t belong here”

I turn and look at him and say 'Oh my god, youre Tom Yorke!'' .. possibly the stupidiest thing ever... he stared at me, like I wasnt there... for the longest time... making me question if he had heard me.. I said 'hello' and tried to strike up a conversation.. but he just carried on looking at me.. to the point I questioned my own existance... and then he walked off, got on a bus and left. I still laugh about it now.

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Kerri Lovesskulls	I’ve seen Radiohead at least 10 times live.   My first Radiohead concert cost me $27 to see.  I’ve met the band and talked to Thom...I don’t care how people get here to introduce themselves to Radiohead but all I ask is that you don’t stop.  Look further! YouTube is a great source of research that 90’s kids had no access to.  They are brilliant and were way ahead of their time.  Creep just scratches the surface of their limitless body of work
Sorrow YT	¿Alguien aparte de mí está aquí por el video de Mangel?
Jose Gabriel Quintana Pimentel	Somebody in 2020!!!
Melting Colors That Don’t Blend	This is Radiohead’s most popular song, i mean it’s ok oh Jesus nothing really special in terms of music. Karma police is like 1,000 times better then this....song

Enzo Schulmeister	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

wild tigers he used to know	"[Verse 1] 

Here's a little song 

I wrote just for you. 

It took like 15 minutes 

And only 4 chords. 

It's not even finished,

But who does care? 

That's so freaking boring,

You are freaking boring. 


[Chorus] 

You're such a snore 

Like anal retentive. 

Can you buddy now buzz off? 

Or I call the scuffers.


[Verse 2] 

Here's the second verse, 

I think it's even worse. 

You're still a dead rubber, 

You can't stand the show. 

You're so out of pitch now, 

But you still don't care. 

That's all freaking boring,

You are freaking boring. 


[Chorus] 

You're such a snore 

Like anal retentive. 

Can you buddy now buzz off? 

Or I call the scuffers. 


[Bridge] 

He's tryna write good song,

He's tryna write. 

And you suck, suck, suck, 

Suck. 


[Outro] 

Whatever you say, bud,

Whatever you do. 

He's so freaking prudent,

You wish you were prudent.

But you're a snore, 

Like anal retentive. 

Can you buddy now buzz off? 

I'm calling the scuffers,

Calling the scuffers."

Ventura Ramos Wayar Nayot	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out

tim.wolf212	For me this song isn´t the story of person that feels ugly and can´t share his/her feelings, for me this song is about a person in a relationship which either feels like he/she isn´t good enough or even notices that he/she is changing. However this person feels pain about his/her own identity and personality which slowly kills the relationship and lefts him/her alone.

Radiohead - CREEP

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

She's running out…
She's running out the door

Chrisna Siahaan Singgih	"Many people been telling me PMJ version is better. Yes. Pmj version is good. Hailey's voice always amazed me. But when i listen to her version, it gives me different vibes. Radiohead version can bring up the ""creep"" ""desperate"" and ""a loner"" vibes more than hailey in my opinion.  Which will be the meaning of this song. she sings the same song as him but she gives a different vibe. Not ""creep"" or ""a loner"" vibes.. but idk it's really hard to explain with words."

daniel garcia	"La letra de este temazo en español:
Cuando estuviste aquí
No pude mirarte a los ojos
Eres como un ángel
Tu piel me hace llorar

Flotas como una pluma
En un hermoso mundo
Desearía ser especial
Eres muy especial

Pero soy insignificante
Soy un bicho raro
¿Qué rayos estoy haciendo aquí?
Si no pertenezco aquí

No me importa si duele
Quisiera tener el control
Quiero un cuerpo perfecto
Quiero el alma perfecta

Quiero que me notes
Cuando no estoy cerca
Eres muy especial
Desearía ser especial

Pero soy insignificante
Soy un bicho raro
¿Qué rayos estoy haciendo aquí?
Si no pertenezco aquí

Ella se va por la puerta
Se está yendo
Ella corre, corre, corre, corre
Corre

Lo que sea que te haga feliz
Lo que sea que quieras
Eres muy especial
Desearía ser especial

Pero soy insignificante
Soy un bicho raro
¿Qué rayos estoy haciendo aquí?
Si no pertenezco aquí
Si no pertenezco aqu

When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"
Dajana Janeva	Perfect song from perfect band
PIU PIU	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special


But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run

Haví Alvarado	"*Letra en Español*

Cuando estuviste aquí antes,
yo no pude mirarte a los ojos.
Eres como un ángel,
tu piel me hace llorar.

Flotas como una pluma
en un mundo hermoso,
desearía ser especial,
tú eres tan especial.

Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.

No importa si duele,
quiero tener el control,
quiero un cuerpo perfecto,
quiero un alma perfecta,
quiero que tú te des cuenta
de cuándo yo no estoy a tu alrededor.
Eres tan tan especial,
desearía ser especial.

Pero yo soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar.

Ella otra vez se va corriendo,
ella se va corriendo, corre...

Lo que sea que te haga feliz,
cualquier cosa que quieras,
eres tan, tan especial.
Desearía ser especial,
pero soy un gusano,
soy un bicho raro,
¿qué demonios estoy haciendo aquí?
No pertenezco a este lugar,
no pertenezco a este lugar."

Ito ang trip, ito ang gusto ko
That is why I'm always here
'Cause i do belong here
II
Sa siopao na 'to
Na empacho yata ako
Ang aking nakain ay lampas labing walo.
I want you to know that paborito ko talaga
Ang siopao na special it's so very special
Minsan ay nababadtrip din ako
Kapag ang siopao ko'y walang walang
Walang walang... laman walang laman... walang laman
Pero kahit ganito bumibili parin ako
Ng siopao na special it's so very
Special... ito ang trip..."

boi boi	I have post-nut clarity
Johnny Quest61	Would you rather blast this song on your stereo system or listen to it off of your smart phone while wearing some fancy headphones? I say there's no replacing the good old floor speakers matched with the right turntable and amplifier set!
El Lanas On Demand	This song has become so special for me, and it's so ironic, because, you always remember this song like the anthem of moody and edgy teenagers, but after living so many moments where this melody was playing, it becomes so much more. It becomes an essential part of you, a piece of your teenage days, where everything seems so complicated and confusing. Man, i wish that i knew that life it's so much bigger, with so many things to learn and experience. This year has been soooo crazy, and it's kinda funny (of the odds) that this was my last year of highschool, but in a weird way, despite of all the horrible tragedies that are happening today in the world, i can see this like a good opportunity for letting all of these memories become something nice and warm, that will always be with me, anytime, anywhere. Thank you so much, Radiohead, for leaving so many special things in our lives, like a friend, that maybe you don't see so often, (depending of how often you listen to them), but when you see him, and talk with him, you feel like you are in home again, bringing to you all those moments that maybe were much lighter or quieter. Where your biggest worry or fear, was to be rejected or to be alone. I don't care if it's the most 'accessible' or 'poser' song of them, for me, it keeps a part of my life with love and peace (finally). I wish that this songs let others, and new generations to come, feel what i felt, feel like i belong actually somewhere, where i'm not a 'Creep'. Thanks for reading (if you did)..
Mr oracle101	Who is here from 14+
Lets Learn Together	I'm listening in 2020 and you'll be too in 2030

jacob martinelli	"the 90s let the creeps back into society. there should have been a non attractive honesty conveyance or advice in every other song (such as - ""instead of hopelessly or pointlessly sulking and or or dwelling about the hopelessness of failed efforts and (potentially being driven by the anxiety of about) attempts, notice the liveliness of the good of things."")

the 1980s was the heyday of psychopathy tolerance. the understanding is one thing, but no one cares - don't let child predators or ""fuming"" people with kids fit in."
Veerle de Vries	Thank you lucifer
Martin Gil	grande masi 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
Anggie Putri erino	dear ibnu & rezky if u read this, fuck you jerk!
Rose Kitty, Gray Kitty, Jack Kitty Kitty	I feel such enlightenment from the universe due to the depressive effects of the melody being converted into a positive energy source.  Spiritual brilliance is always misunderstood by society due to the mind being buried alive and is often frowned upon instead of being seen as special, yet these song has over 414m views alone, even though so many describe it as depressing.  The universe has grabbed your mind to connect, but most do not get the message and so it hides in dreams, which most ignore, if they even remember.
Rose Kitty, Gray Kitty, Jack Kitty Kitty	I love the guitar effects of a lightning/storm starting to brew between the verse and the chorus.  It is very subtle, but not so at the very same time because it is so noticeable to me.  I look/notice /hear the things the guitar is saying without words.  Often times, the guitar will contradict lyrics, thus, a new sound is born!
Rose Kitty, Gray Kitty, Jack Kitty Kitty	Whoever produced this song has brilliance, due to the melody and the mixture of lyrical content and the contrasts within those words as in some match the melody, while others do not---brilliant!  I had been looking for this song, but never knew the title until I  saw an interview with Layne Staley who stated how he loved the song.  I would have never even imagined the title would have been 'creep', due to the melody.  Thank you Layne!  I think you won another bet...

So let me just say and I may be just speaking for myself, but imo we/they were wrong. This song is put together so well and this singer's vocals just went off the Richter scale! Thank you Radiohead for making this!

己斐健太郎	"creep

When you were here before
Couldn’t look you in the eye
You’re just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You’re so fuckin’ special
この前、ここで君を見た時
君の目をまともに見られなかった
君はまるで天使みたいで
泣きたくなるほどキレイな肌
君は美しい世界を
羽毛のように舞う
僕も特別な存在だったら
君は気が変になりそうなほど特別だから
 
But I’m a creep
I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here
でも僕は気持ち悪くて変なヤツ
一体こんなところで何してるんだろう？
ここは僕が居ちゃいけない
 
・weirdo　変人、奇妙な人
・what the hell　信じられない様子や動揺した様子（whatを強調した表現）
 
I don’t care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I’m not around
You’re so fuckin’ special
I wish I was special
傷ついたって構わない
自分をコントロールしたい
完璧な肉体を手に入れ
完璧な魂を宿したい
僕がそばにいなくても
気づいて欲しいんだ
君は狂いそうなほど特別だから
僕も特別だったらいいのに
 
But I’m a creep
I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here
でも僕は気持ち悪くて変なヤツ
一体こんなところで何してるんだろう？
ここは僕が居ちゃいけない
 
She’s running out the door
She’s running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
あの娘がドアの外に走っていく
あの娘が走り去っていく
あの娘が逃げる、逃げる、逃げてしまう
 
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You’re so fuckin’ special
I wish I was special
But I’m a creep
I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here
I don’t belong here
君を喜ばせるのならどんな事でも
君が欲しがるのならどんなものでも
君は狂いそうなほど特別だから
僕も特別だったら
でも僕は気持ち悪くて変なヤツ
一体こんなところで何してるんだろう？
僕なんか居ちゃいけない僕なんか居ちゃいけない"

Cesar Emilio Marin Lista	"Cuando todo va bien, gozas de salud y bienestar sientes que no necesitas de Dios, pero sepas que cuando le das las espaldas a Dios y a su palabra tarde o temprano la vida te va cobrar tus obras sean malas o buenas.

Entonces te convencerás que nada importa en la vida porque nada tiene sentido sin Dios en el corazón no tienes paz estarás perdido y agobiado no encontrarás paz ni reposo, porque sólo con Dios en la vida, se puede tener la verdadera paz, aunque viviendo en pobreza pero con Cristo se puede ser feliz.
Quiero ser amigo de Dios, quiero también ser su amigo pero usted poco comenta mis poemas, mis reflexiones que solo Cristo Jesús sabe que es para su adoración, y cuando decimos adorar a Cristo Jesús inmediatamente pensamos en decir amen, cosa que no debería ser sin antes glorificar su nombre, entonces amiga porque no, glorificar su mensaje comentando su nombre glorioso y bendecirme diciendo lo que te hace sentir ser hijo de Cristo y mi amiga personal,..."

Kyle Warner	My friend recently passed and this was his song to play at our local open mic. He would always scream the part where Thom sings “RRRUUUNNNN!!”. Tonight we had an open mic dedicated to his memory. I started it off by covering this song and screaming his usual part. After hearing the clapping before it was over, there was a moment where I knew we all felt the same. Between the audience and the performer. Like damn, I miss you man, but this one is for you. RIP Kristian Andersen 💚

Hugo Antonio Terán	"Lyrics:

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special 
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door
She's running out
She's run, run, run, run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Ashen Light	"the backstory behind this is actually really interesting and quite depressing

when thom was in uni (university of exeter), he fell for this girl, he thought he wasnt worth the girl's love and was too afraid to ask her out

for 8 months thom stalked her because he couldnt even go up to her, he was scared that she'd look down on him. due to that he made this song

his self conscious as you can see is not the best, even today


im sorry if this isnt the backstory its what i was told"

Tell him your problems. Give him all your burdens. I can't go through this mess by myself. Give all your troubles to God. Let him fight the battle for you. He has always loved you & always will. Please have a wonderful rest of your day,  whoever you are.

Mackey Dirk	There are a lot of parallels between this song and smells like teen spirit. One being that both songs are anthems of a generation. Another, in that Radiohead and Nirvana did not want their song to define them or their sound.
Chrissy Skywalker	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

गू गा	"I'm 8,498 Earth years old.  Nobody from my home planet of Omricon Cephalopodii 17-B understands why I use my sonar receptive lobes to receive sound waves from your primitive rocky planet, full of silica, iron and numerous carbon-based life forms.  I particularly enjoy the collection of organic cells known as ""Human"".  Almost everyone here prefers that new top-40 over-produced tripe known as ""60hz, repeating"" (also known colloquially at 'tone 2').  I admit, I am a fan of 30 to 45hz, but anything over that is pure Lamarax droppings.  Why won't anybody here understand me?!?  I was born in the wrong galactic quadrant.. tear"

Nigel Appleton	This reminds me of a girl who I never had the guts to ask out. It’s kinda sad though, because thinking back on it, it would’ve been fine. I looked forward to seeing her in my classes. I think I creeped her out though. I don’t really know where it went wrong. Probably the fact that she was one of the most popular girls. And I of corse was not. The funny thing is I probably wouldn’t be able to ask her out today.

I remember the very thoughtful guy at the table with the blonde hair hiding most of his face.  Not sure the whole band was there.  Anyway, Hi from the past.  When they told me your bands name was radiohead I replied that you were going to be big.  I have that gift ;)

Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy

Tharsis	This song has probably the worst drum track in modern rock history... not only are the riffs and bass tracks lackluster, but their drummer has a 5 piece kit with some big, beefy looking toms and doesn’t use them even once for a fill except at the end and literally uses one crash cymbal every like 8 measures, how exactly did this song become so popular? It sounds good enough to play the role as a song, but the technicality of it is utter trash

Vincenzo Torelli	You never feel you will find the one. Your heart is dry and empty, and you miss the life you never had. So you go to sleep, all alone. You wake up, only not in your bed, but in another alternate universe. The colors are sharper than ever, everything is greater and more beautiful. But above everything else, everything is alive and happy. It is the middle of the night, yet everything is illuminated by the moonlight. You are dressed in the finest attire, with colors you've never seen before stitched beautifully throughout your clothing. You stand on an incredibly intricately designed pier- one made of the finest marble and gemstone. There is an immense ocean, and you admire the way the moon glistens over the water. You feel at peace in this universe- a feeling of belonging and tranquility like you have never felt. You see a feather, so beautiful and graceful in its fall- floating onto the water. You notice something moving behind you. When you turn and look, you suddenly feel emotions you didn't know existed. Emotions so deep and profound, you feel as if you could pass out from the pure ecstasy. The most beautiful girl you have ever imagined is right there, walking back on the pier. She looks into your eyes, and even though she is quite far from you, you are transfixed on how beautiful hers are. She motions you to follow. And there you go, chasing this angel of heaven down this seemingly endless bridge. She pranced effortlessly and immaculately, like a ballet dancer on stage. It was then she stopped, and ran to you. You both look into each others eyes, and you both smile. You dance by the moonlight, and you feel love for the first time. You know it, and every time you look into her eyes, you fall further and further. She takes your hand, and together you walk hand in hand to the end of the bridge. You find yourself in a town, yet with no people. It looks as if it was from an ancient time, yet it is so new and otherworldly. Only one place is illuminated, a small restaurant, with a table set up in front perfectly for the two of you. You help your love sit down, and you take a seat across. And you enjoy the finest meal you've ever indulged in. You want to converse with her, but you can't. There is no words to be said. You feel a wave of shame and unworthiness. You wish you had a perfect body, and a perfect soul. Then you would be worthy, you would be perfect. But you suddenly realize- you are. Finally, you are. When you finish the dinner, you and your angel run about the whole town, through valleys, up towering peaks and mountains, across the beaches. The stars were magnificent and many, and you picked out formations as you stargaze with her. You realize just how special she truly is. Every detail, look, and aspect about her is only one could dream of. You fall asleep in each others eyes, and smile as you snooze away the night you two had. A great trembling awakes you, and the sky is blood red. The moon is now gone- and the town is on fire. The mountains were collapsing, the sea rocking, and the valleys splitting. You look into each others eyes, and realize that together, you have everything you ever want or need. As you embrace, the universe and reality collapses, and everything was gone forever. Everything. You wake up, immersed in sweat. Soon, tears well up in your eyes, and you realize what just happened. You become grateful for it, but distraught of losing whatever it was. You get out of bed, and play this very song. The words couldn't have meant more. Thank you for reading, if you did.

Otavio Luis	COMES TO BRAZIL

You're just like an angel

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

Angelique Menoptra	Its something everyone of us that counts themselves as human has felt at one time or another as we grow up girls, boys … there that rough  time when you feel not good of enough and there's that apple of your eye that person you could absolutly swear that glows and you can't stop thinking about them, and that makes those feeling cut even deeper … but we all get over it, though that feeling is stamp on our soul indelibly forever.  This song is so good though, I guess this what what they use defined about black music that taged it as soul music, reaching very deeply into  oneself to expose in song your soul, its condition the ugly , joyous, frail , inept, imperfect, faulty, tattered and blissful conditions of your soul.  And if you sang all these vulnrable thing about yourself well enough to music, such a personal outing would not be an awkward thing and you'd have a hit like this

Years later i met a guy, didn't mean to be with each other futher than that day but today i know it was important to open some views, who have RH as one of his favorite bands and i give it a try again,  knowing the story of the band and stuff i revisit this song and today i can laugh."

WAYCNF	They're so unrecognizable. The only thing that makes you know it's them is Thom's voice, and even then you'd think it'd be an earlier band to Radiohead. The Bends is where I say they started to get their style, not that Pablo Honey is bad by any means, just not really a Radiohead record. Besides, Street Spirit is a phenomenal song.

Well our hair stood straight up when we were first able to hear that Guitar Rip @ 2:00 we both just stopped and stared at each other and said what the F--k We  both said of all the times hearing that song  we never ever caught that rip before  it cracked us up . Those were the best times of my life  in Denver summer 93

wenis wangler	this song fits me right now. you'll never know the feeling of liking someone and have the selected person alienate you. making you like her more but put you in a state of realization of your a miserable creep looking for more. it makes you depresed because your in a trap and think your out of it
tuce	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy

Andry Jurgüen Rivera Cupe	Dear reader , I don’t know you and you don’t  know me . Probably we are not even living in the same country . We look different . You may be older than me or younger . We are just completely strangers . But there are a few things which connect us . We are humans . We have emotions and feelings . A personality which defines us . And we are both on YouTube , searching for sad songs, no matter why. Please, if you read this. No matter what's going on in your life at the moment ,you can do it ! You can manage out if it, you will stay strong because there are people who love you ! And these people are worth it. Yes, we are strangers but not too far away from eachother to not say that you are a great person !!! Because you are ! I hope even if it’s just one of you, that I could help or support you in a way . This comment is for all the lonely people out there 🤍

Lil Oncie	Sometimes I come onto songs like this on YT (songs I know are bound to have comments from people detailing their sad and complex life story) and it really moves me in a way not much else can.

I see it as I love them and they love me but I can't see myself the way they see me so my own insecurities threaten the relationship. it's accepting that they see u in a different way to how you see urself bc nobody sees u how u see urself
David Doyle	Cool ass tune. It would be way cool to be a bar band and play this and I will be !! but the lead singer looks like Eminem lol

Mirtill Csiga	Please tell me that I'm not the only one here because of Lucifer... And btw I can relate to the song
Luboman411	"Putting my feelings and emotions into the hands of someone is something I don't do well. This song is mostly about that. So some of these lyrics don't do it for me. But this:  ""I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control, I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul...""  These lyrics you never outgrow. I'm nearing 40 years old, and I still definitely want to have control, a perfect body (or a body that doesn't fall apart on me by the time I'm 60), and definitely a perfect soul. Sigh..."

Denis Grigoriev	"утопаю в этих глазах
Ведь ты словно ангел, там в небесах
Ты просто порхаешь, где-то там надо мной
И всё напрасно, ты слишком прекрасна

А я лишь пыль
Если честно
Боже, что я здесь забыл
Мне здесь не место

Я хочу измениться, стать сильным душой
И красивое тело, чтоб быть рядом с тобой
Чтобы ты замечала, что меня рядом нет
Но всё напрасно, ты слишком прекрасна

А я лишь пыль
Если честно
Боже, что я здесь забыл
Мне здесь не место

И вновь она порхает
И исчезает прочь

И это не важно, что манит тебя
Ты слишком прекрасна, и всё напрасно

Ведь я лишь пыль
Если честно
Боже, что я здесь забыл
Мне здесь не место"

E quem amafagafar os mafagafinhos
Bom amafagafigador será

Eu fundei
A Associação Internacional
De Proteção às Borboletas do Afeganistão
Te provei por B mais C
Que as meninas dos teus olhos
Não têm menstruação
Dar um prato de trigo pra dois tigres
E ver os bichos brigando é legal que só (miau)

Serei sempre seu escravo-de-Jó...🎶"

Philippe Cirse	It reminds me of this musician friend, an esteemed man who said me after swallowing three glasses of Gigondas that he believed very strongly in arrogance, hated the idea of submission, of humility, and that if he had to undergo a form of constraint or dictatorship, he would always prefer that it be exercised by the musical elite than by the masses. We can negotiate with the musical elite. With the masse it’s difficult, she speaks too loud!

Dak’s Recovered Ankle	"Here’s to all the people that got turned down feeling sad for yourself. You’re not entitled to anyone no matter how much you like them and adore them, we are all individuals and you need to learn to love yourself first. Everyone tries to force love because of animal instinct and we need to move on from that cause it overall is just selfish to expect anyone to love you or feel the same way you do. That’s why there’s such a high rate of divorce. People need to quit trying to satisfy their animalistic instincts at the cost of other people and focus on themselves. This is why you need to chill out and take your time so when a real connection happens you can actually appreciate that and not take it for granted. This will help with over population and kids not living with both parents or with one missing all together cmon you guys quit being animals. 

Yes I’m high af ✌️"

자기 전 담배를 태우며 이 노래의 절정으로 달려갈 때면
자기혐오와 모멸감에 찌든 내가 잠시나마
다른 세상으로 탈출하는 느낌이 든다

오늘도 여전히 이 노래에 머무른다.
내일이 되어도 그녀는 계속 달리고 있을까?"

Bruce K	One of the best songs, ever - I know, I know - but listen to it over and over - his vocal transition is unparalleled . Case in point, how many top level bands add this to their cover lineup and try to perform in front of a group? Not many - it's a unique song and mixture of talents. Still is an amazing song

Johnny Aachen	I never heard Radiohead's music before. I'm just hearing the original, because a music course classmate just did a Heavy Metal cover of it for a song cover competition. I don't even know when this came out, but I guess the 90s? When he belts out in the higher range,  he sounds like Bono's long melodic line in Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. So I'm guessing they might be contemporaries along with Curt Cobain. It's not music of my generation.  I'll look it up. Lyrics are an interesting take on love and not being worthy of the other person.
STENO261	Quand je suis pas bien, j'écoute cette chanson et je vais mieux
Faizan Munir	"What is this shit!? Why the fuck is it hyped!? What the fuck, was this talent in the 80's, what, just screams, loud useless bass and weird ass facial expressions, what the fuck!!! I really appreciate songs like angel of the morning or even space oddity but this, this is trash. Pure trash hyped up for no fucking reason, I'd rather listen to mumble rap than this shit, just came to check what's all the hype and please anyone explain WHAT THE FUCK!! 
Get high on dopanmines, heroin, weed, pick up an electric guitar and ear rape the audience with non sense and bullshit and blind them with ugly expression so they can't see what actual shit this is.."

Ely López González	I am 44 now, and I believe recovered from an eating dissorder, which haunted me during a big part or my younger years. When this song came out I couldn't stop listening to it since it practically said everything that was going through my mind... I want a perfect body, I wanna have control, I'm like a feather, I don't belong here... and every single line in it. I was so into Ana and Mia thinspiration. All of a sudden it comes back and I am so happy I can say today I am alive and well, happily married with a daughter who is perfect just as she is and who I bow to protect from everything that dares atempt messing with her head and giving her the idea she is not enough.

Paci skylla	"It's a story I imagine when I listen to this song: a depressed boy in a wheelchair whose only ray of sunshine in his life was a very sparkling young girl unfortunately in a relationship with her big brother.Their relationship will be toxic.  Her older brother is a deranged, impulsive person who will eventually kill her.  He loved her so much and thinks about her at her funeral, leaves flowers every day at her grave and keeps a memory : a picture of her in his bedroom. 

5 years later : 
He's doing rehab while thinking of her, who tends to encourage her.  He succeeds even though she can never see him..."

Paci skylla	"When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye

Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special

молочкой запива-ал

и вдруг решил пукнуть
легонечко пукнуть

припев :
И Я НАСРАЛ
пошла жижа
я так себя подъеба-ал
и себя наневижу

мне сыро в штанах
будто нарынул в фонтан
с позором пошёл в ванну
позор по мне стекал
теперь стою за чертой
но вони ещё нет
но есть одно чувство
паскудное чувство

ЗАТО ТЕПЛО
но там не чисто
я так себя подъеба-ал
всё уже слиплось, всё теперь слиплось ,всё точно слиплось"

I'm currently sobbing cuz it makes me so sad that people, like me, don't know what they're here for, can't find their purpose in life even though we're always being told  each one of us has a purpose. I guess it's worse knowing someone else is having a hard time with nobody to help them than me. I hope the statements related to happiness always finding it's way into your life are true, because I'm still hoping to find mine someday, and I wish you do too.
