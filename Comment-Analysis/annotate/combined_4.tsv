12	duda	"Whenever I hear this song my heart breaks. My grandmother passed away on June 1st of that year, I saw her die in front of me and I could do absolutely nothing, this song was playing on my headphones while she was dying in that hospital bed, after that day I was never the same. I feel like crap for not showing how special she was to me, she was the only one who supported me in everything, she was always by my side, even if I was wrong. now after that i don't see any reason why i'm still alive, i'm just living for her.. ""what the hell am i doing here?"""	Creep

To tell him I'm a creep, because I'm afraid he'll run away. He'll know I'm a loser. He has no trouble opening up to me about his problems, but I would never tell him any of mine...	Creep

304	Miguel	His acting is so fucking good and natural in this one, he's like angry that he can't have who he wants because he can't possibly be at level, so it becomes a sort of love-hate, he's fighting hard to accept that he can't blame, that there's no way around and has to let go. When he realizes that she runs away he breaks down crying like a baby, then after letting everything out, acceptance gave him peace. Best performance.	Creep

409	Jen	I just read an article about the history of this song and Radioheads negative feelings about it. I did not know they disliked it , started calling it ‚Äú crap‚Äù and hardly ever played it. The clunks in the song are apparently one of the band members trying to ‚Äú ruin‚Äù it , and it flunked in the UK charts at first but was picked up by an American college station where it started to take off . It was first recorded as the band were playing it as a warm up song , without their knowledge , which is why is sounds so powerful because it was utterly self conscious. Interesting! Probably my one of my favourite songs ever and OMG are the band deaf? How can they hate this beautiful, melodic, touching , souring , magnificent and timeless song?	Creep

1	Brandon Lewis Gaming	I think this was the best piece of pop art about death until Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlackstar‚Äù 12 years later	Hurt
2	Z K	The point of this song is beyond what many people think. He‚Äôs referring to his past life of fame , drugs and trophies as an empire of dirt that will fail you not only emotionally but you can‚Äôt take any of that to the grave, it‚Äôll give you pain and hurt especially in comparison to the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ that has victory over the grave. Jesus is the way the truth and the life. The 10 commandments are the moral law, you and I broke the law, but Jesus paid the fine. That is the whole purpose of the coming, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. To pay the wages that were due to us so that those who believe will be pardoned on judgement day. I believe this song has a sense of regret of choosing the life he chose in the past over the precious gift of salvation, when we know this truth and continue to indulge in sin, it‚Äôs as if we are nailing Jesus back to the cross. But I believe Johnny cash came back to the truth and entered glory with his Savior.	Hurt

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way	Hurt

I quickly find a copy, cue it up and sit in my teacher's chair - just - listening. Replaying it three times because I can't believe what I'm hearing. I've never, ever heard anyone sledgehammer their stake in the ground with such musical perfection. Johnny absolutely OWNED this song in every way. To this day, his version still has the same effect on me, and probably you as well."	Hurt

51	Sean Atherton-Feeney	The greatest compliment to a song writer is to have their song covered so well its authorship is lost and the global community forgets you wrote it. In that forgetting can be found, ironically, immortality. Thanks Trent and Cash.	Hurt

53	helmut23456	This song touches my soul.... Johnny's greatest work; he saved it for last~~~~	Hurt
54	Dan Gennaro	You know, I was never a big fan of Johnny cash, never was a country fan at all, I said his music was too dark or sad, or depressing as a teen and young adult. Then you get older and life happens, where you find yourself in a dark pit, when everything is upside down, wrecked, and all of a sudden his music resonates so much more in my soul. Especially this song above all else. What a amazing anthem.	Hurt
55	Mike Freitag	I can‚Äôt even listen to it. üò¢	Hurt
56	David Cox	Cash's version of this song still makes the hairs on my arm stand up. 25 years ago, if someone suggested Johnny Cash was going to cover a Nine Inch Nails song, I would have said that's a stupid and even ridiculous idea. But my God, this song is at another level. So emotional it rips you apart.	Hurt

63	Autism Social Cast	Time forces the memory in its place. Instant gratification is only for the Cool Cats. Let me explain. Memory makes you want to go back to that feeling. Addiction, a terrible thing that the elite neurotypicals. Resistant to peer pressure unless it for its own petty gain, then force must be used, because natural selection never ends well for the monster. You will never take down the ringleader, you can persuade those around them to pull the trigger.	Hurt
64	DrMattDestruction	they lied to you about the minimum wage. if the minimum wage was $0/hour, you could've been hiring employees since you were 14. everyone can afford to work for $0/hour if the Universal Basic Income is in place. let's give everyone a guaranteed minimum income of $1,500ish USD/month. tretettetet	Hurt
65	christianlorre	It's so chilling. And so sad seeing how much he aged so badly. Brings out a lot lot of pain because I remember my mother and how much she changed in the last 25 years of her life going downhill so subtle until you realize how much is lost far too late.	Hurt

74	Clint Potts	I grew up listening to my dad listening to Johnny Cash. He had all the early albums and when he got in a particular mood, the Johnny Walker and the Johnny Cash came out. He'd sit in the dark listening to all of the old songs. When the music stopped and the lights went on, dad was himself again. Sometimes, you just need to feel some pain. I always respected Cash but it was this song that made me understand. This song made me a fan. Sometimes, you just need to Hurt.	Hurt
75	Whitevaliantwarrior	üéº It doesn't matter who you are...Great, small or tiny, burnt out with nothing to your name. No matter what you have attained or all the money, fame and riches to your name. Because in the end you take nothing with you. All will stand before their Maker, Creator of all mankind, The highest, most mighty of any & everything. ( 2 Corinthians 5:10 ) For we must all appear before the judgment seat of CHRIST, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. ( Romans 14:12 ) So then each one of us will give an account of himself to GOD. ( Hebrews 9:27 ) And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment üôè üôå .	Hurt

I always say with pride to this day that I grew up with the best music ever. I wish country music was the same. Oh the good times good days. One day I'm gonna buy me a truck just like my dads travel to whever the road takes me and blast Jonny Cash on the radio..	Hurt
81	Miss Deadite	parts of this song both the NiN version and his cover are basically the relationship I have in my head with my mental illnesses. At some point I make a new mistake and they feed off of each other over and over. Never ending pain for days or weeks. I get to a point where I shut down. The pain numbs and I can function again until the next mistake and it begins again.	Hurt
82	Sheenia S.A.R.G	This song makes u cry...I haft to say this is the sadest song Johnny Cash has ever sung its sad to see him and June gone They was the best country singers they will be missed..	Hurt

96	IAmManWithTheGun	He died just one year after performing this cover‚Ä¶	Hurt
98	Koheleth	I know he did A LOT of dope, but I just don't think that accounts for how poorly he aged. People of his generation surely aged poorly. I mean the man only live to be 71, would've been about 70 when he filmed this, but looked and seemed every bit of 90. Today 70-year-olds certainly don't look young, but they didn't age that badly in comparison. And today you'll find many people in their 60s who look pretty damned good. And I'm talking rock stars who partied hard like Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, Tommy Shaw, etc. There's a quite a few who have aged really well. But people do seem to age better, not everyone, but in general. I mean, that's why you have Tom Brady playing in the NFL at 45 and other athletes--fighters even--competing professionally into their 40s. I remember when Joe Montana seemed like an old man when he went to Kansas City in his 30s. Lot of genetic luck involved for sure, but it's important to take care yourself too, but it's amazing that even those who don't still seem to age better than the generations before them. Probably a lot of stuff in environment is better today, no lead in the paint or gasoline anymore, probably lots of reasons for it.	Hurt

107	JxrZ	Not only does this hit hard, you can feel the pain in Johnny Cash‚Äôs voice. All the things he probably wishes he done differently, just like any human on the planet. We all have regrets. It‚Äôs sad world we live in and no matter how hard we try, we still have them. I told myself I wasn‚Äôt gonna do drugs when I seen D.A.R.E, but that was a lie. I‚Äôm clean now, but I did listen to this when I was high. You‚Äôll never understand the word hate until you‚Äôve hated yourself	Hurt

181	Renaider	"Until you (we) die , everyone goes before you. Then you leave someone when it's your turn. It's a dirty trick this life thing plays on us because if you are privileged enough to live a long life , you are also cursed enough to lose more loved ones. The best we can hope for is to enjoy them while they're here and honor their memories when they are gone. It's not all so morbid though. Life is a gift and , like everything it comes at a cost. ""I would rather have loved and lost than never loved at all"" is one of my favorite sayings. Enjoy the now."	Hurt

245	Wes Baumguardner	Perhaps I am biased, but I prefer the original. Cash is so monotoned and almost expressionless throughout the entire song that it sounds almost robotic to me. Perhaps people take this monotone expressionless voice as a man coming to grips with his mortality in casual acceptance, which I understand, but I still do not think that makes it as exceptionally great of a performance as many people do.

323	Eternally Thankful 3771	This video of Cash doing Trent's song is just THE most emotional I've ever gotten over a music vid - it gets me EVERY SINGLE time I watch it. I in ZERO way want to detract from the song , but I didn't like it when NIN did it...just couldn't relate so it didn't reach me...ZERO hate or disrespect...it just didn't move me because of where I was at at that time. Then I watched a video interview about Cash wanting to do the song and Trent's ok with doing so...watched the video and I was floored....truly , whole-heartedly emotional...WOW !! The video and it's message speaks for itself and needs NO explanation from me as to why it is SO powerful. The ADDED power comes from my realization that Trent , not only by giving his permission to cover the song , but the arrival of Trent himself at a place where he can acknowledge another artist's greatness with the piece AND be completely happy with letting go of the song for Johnny's legacy - it just so much about how much Trent has grown as a human being and a man - I hope he realizes the beauty , growth and accomplishment of himself in this journey. Much respect to both artists , the video director and all who made this loving achievement possible.	Hurt
324	LeeLee Me	Her face. Knowing this would be his last video. Knowing first hand what he had and lost to age and time. That blink said it all.

356	BixLives32	"Johnny and June, June and Johnny. A matched set of two unique, individuals. Each had their own song writing style, quite different from each other. June probably wrote significantly more songs than Johnny. I have not heard a song written by either of them that I did not like, ...A LOT. I have not compared their publishing catalogues, but I am fairly sure that June's songwriting was more prolific. Johnny's great talent seemed to be his impeccable taste, and ability to find superior songs. Johnny Cash was able to uniquely interpret and perform a song so that the song would forever be identified with Cash. Despite this daunting ability, other performers continue to cover Johnny's interpretations of songs written by others. (I haven't that much courage). When Johnny Cash performed a song it was his forever. One oddity in Cash's career is ""The Folsom Prison Blues"". Even today, Johnny is listed as the song's writer. Nope. The song was written by Gordon Jenkins as the ""The Second Dream - The Conductor"" on the seminal, thematic album, ""Seven Dreams"" (1954) by Gordon Jenkins on Decca. I mention this because this was THE first microgroove, long playing record to boast a contiguous theme without the usual banding between cuts (like the Beatles, Sgt Peppers). Seven Dreams was a milestone and I recommend this record , ‚Äîif you can find a copy! It was released on CD, but the tapes were old and the digital master done poorly. I have a clean copy of the original Decca (""Unbreakable"") record, and have faithfully remastered it using professional gear. I wish I could give you all a copy. It remains an important record and quite enjoyable. I suspect that Johnny wrote his version of ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" shortly prior to the concert. That Cash used Gordon Jenkins music and lyrics as a vehicle for ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" was likely NOT a conscious act of plagiarism. I suspect that Johnny believed that he desperately needed new material that would relate to the prisoners and show them that he was NOT influenced by the prison authorities. Johnny simply substituted a few words to the Gordon Jenkins song, thus, forever branding the song his own. It's not important who wrote the song, but that Johnny had the taste and sense to make the song his own and appropriate for his unusual and dangerous audience. The inmate audience did NOT riot. There was even some mixing of black and white prisoners (unthinkable at that time). To a man, the inmates were well behaved and had a great time. Plus, Johnny was able to make the concert part of his personal moral statement that he felt was central to his life. Only Johnny Cash could have bought off this great performance. Any person, abused, tread upon, or who feels themselves injured, will find HEALING in Johnny and June's work. Oddly, many people thought Johnny had served prison time (not true); ‚Äîprobably confusing Johnny with Merle Haggard, as well as a couple of minor arrests Johnny suffered in two small southern towns while he was touring. They were errors of police judgement and Johnny was released in the morning. When touring back then, particularly in The South, most artists knew to stay close to the hotel (or private home, if they were a black artist). Jim Crow ruled for many years. If the prison officials had known about the song, I am sure they would have insisted that Cash NOT play the song. No joke, EVERYONE was scared out of their wits, prior to the concert. I am sure Johnny did not intentionally lift the song, plus, the original song was a 1 - 4 - 5 based blues. The Gordon Jenkins record was obviously an important work and heard by many people in the industry. Johnny would surely have heard the original. I have heard that Johnny financially settled with Decca and Gordon Jenkins as soon as he was informed of the plagiarism. The Folsom Prison concert was , perhaps, the bravest act of any performing artist in history. Columbia Records desperately tried to thwart the project, but Cash was intent. As he was selling a LOT of records, Johnny was able (barely) to make it all happen. The Folsom Warden and other CA State prison officials were also against the project. All the ""experts"" were predicting a riot. The movie did not show nearly the anxiety over the project. Moreover, Johnny and June were scared beyond any other concert they had performed. How Johnny and June manage to make the Folsom project happen is beyond me. If you like this music, have a listen to June's last few records, particularly, ""Press On"". The entire album works as a whole and could easily be labelled a masterpiece. ""Gatsby's Restaurant"", ""Tiffany Anastasia Lowe"" and ""I Used To Be Somebody"" are songs that I found unusually affecting and entertaining. Norman Blake's work is wonderful; ‚Äîsimple and pure soul. Marty Stuart is also on the record and plays as you would expect; ‚Äîperfect. The album sounds like people in a living room playing and having a nice evening. There is great humour, however, there are also points at which you might find yourself crying..."	Hurt

407	Robert Felsing	This isn‚Äôt just a song, it‚Äôs a moment in time that cannot be repeated. Only Johnny Cash could have sung this song the way he did, and he could only sing it the way he did after a lifetime of being Johnny Cash. God bless Trent Reznor for giving him the platform to do so.	Hurt

416	Michael Mannucci	The comment section is full of NIN fans who desperately need to let everyone know Cash didn‚Äôt write it. Like, ok, we get it! I mean, I think this cover shows that there‚Äôs more to a good song than good lyrics. The original isn‚Äôt a very good song. Cash took the good lyrics and general structure and made a good song. *ducks from all the angry NIN fans*	Hurt

435	ZAJ	I remember my mom being a fan of Cash. Lately I have been thinking about her again. Because despite the fact she walked out of my life with no regard for the family she was tearing apart, and how much I hate that she did that to me... I still loved her. And I've found myself tearing up sometimes when I listen to this song because, it's such a profound expression of regret and yearning. Often I've found myself struggling with the hole left inside of me because of my mom. It's led me down an unstable road due to how that deep loss struck my mental health. My mom might be someone else now. But I'm still here, right now, and I want to become something better despite how I lost her. I truly want to be someone better than what losing her the way I did had made me into. I end up drawn to this song, because I've done a lot of things to make people hurt, done things that I deeply regret, and I always yearn to start anew somehow. I want to find a way, like that closing lyric. It's strange how a song by an artist that my estranged mother loved, has still found such a deep comforting connection to me. It's simply reassuring, humbling, and profound.	Hurt

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way	Hurt

513	Jhonalter Jos√© de Campos	(üáßüá∑) I can't believe he passed away in 2003 a few months after his wife passed away. Is this song about regret? Is it a song of bitterness? Is it recognition? It's a message that he was it making everything transparent? It got to me. I can't believe it will be 20 years since his death!!! N√£o acredito que ele faleceu em 2003, alguns meses depois que sua esposa faleceu. Essa m√∫sica √© sobre arrependimento? √â uma can√ß√£o de amargura? √â reconhecimento? √â uma mensagem que estava deixando tudo em pratos limpos? Isso me pegou!

I was a part of a community theater that did a program called ""Little Ole Opry""... So wjen our director heard Johnny Cash was doing a show, she got all us Opry dancers down there. The house was packed, for an impromptu! Small town.. News go quick! So we're in the front row and he sees us girls all gussied up in our Opry dance dresses and calls us up! We only danced to old bluegrass songs like Foggy Mountain Breakdown and such... But the band only knew The Devil Went Down to Georgia... So we got up and danced to that üòÅüíï Johnny and June were so gracious and lovely. He even signed my dance shoe after we performed. Most memorable experience in my life... Besides giving birth to my 2 beautiful children and also meeting Mikhail Barishyshikov.. And he signed my ballet shoes too!

560	ŒíŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒûŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ	Perhaps the greatest cover of a song ever, right next to All Along the Watchtower and Knocking on Heavens Door. The impact that the time period of Cash's life has in the cover is so massive. I've never heard a song that takes a bigger and harder hit each time I listen to it, as my time in this world passes. Truly amazing.	Hurt
561	Roller Girl	Trent should see this song as flattery. Yes Johnny out did him and made it HIS song but for good reason. He was the OG. And as much as Trent has suffered in his life Johnny suffered more if only through age and experience. You can just feel the loss of his brother, growing up literally dirt poor, decades of drug addiction heartbreak and loss and more then anything? REGRET. He just wants to go back and start his life over when he‚Äôs so close to death. This would have been a good song for Elvis to cover too but he died a decade before it was written. It‚Äôs impossible to watch this without crying üíîüòû At least Johnny had his wife	Hurt

623	J D	If I could do it all over again.I would start by being a better person.Because in this life I was not a good man.I lied.I hurt people.And with time all the people I loved and hurt ,died away.I would give my entire fortune to do it all over again.This time,I'd do it right.I would be a good person.I'd make it work. To me Mr. Cash was repenting all of his sins.To whom ever he may have hurt. And most of all to his maker.This song came along right as he was to die and it was a given that he sung it.	Hurt
624	JWM	the goose bumps never stop	Hurt
625	Samuel.J.Barker	"It's sad to me how so many have heard this, but not fully acknowledged the message. Johnny Cash lived a long life full of success and material wealth, in fact his life was overrun with the necessity to maintain his empire. At the time of the recording of Hurt, when Cash was 71, he'd realised the superficiality of it all. He'd reached the end of the line, looked back at his empire and saw it was nothing but dirt. What was worse is the fact, the higher the heights you reach, the harder it is you'll fall. Age is not kind to anyone, but someone dependent on image far less. If he could, he would trade it all to start again and keep HIMSELF. Fame and money won't embrace you when you're dying, neither will memories of roaring crowds or moments of success. The only thing that will embrace you when you're on your way out, is the loved ones you've made in your life. A life of fame and wealth is a life that makes this a very hard thing to achieve. Yet nowadays it's more aspired to than it ever has been before. Cash learned the hard way, he was trying to warn you. ""Keep to yourself"" I won't reach the end of the line having chased fame to the top and roil under the pressure of the fall"	Hurt
626	Undertaker67203	This song still fills me with strong emotions barely under control. Never has two versions of one song conveyed such strong but differing views. Trent was young barely keeping it together. Johnny was at the end, seeing his life in the rear view and knowing not much time lay ahead. Both versions are so powerful.	Hurt

Thinking, with June gone, I‚Äôm sure he wanted to be with her. Went to the bedroom and came out to hearing it announced that Johnny Cash had passed away.. I was dumbstruck‚Ä¶devastated and deeply saddened such an icon that I‚Äôve ‚Äúknown‚Äù since I was a small child was gone.	Hurt

639	MaddawgMar MMA Takes	The fact that Reznor was young when he wrote this and recorded it was sad that he faced all that at such a young age. But for Cash to record it at the end of his life made it that much more sad, as there was no time to change it. It added a depth of sadness to an already sad song. Both artists are geniuses	Hurt

657	Isaiah Voss	"20 years this year it would've been since you've been gone Johnny. This is your swan song. This is every man's song of regret from their past but has a beautiful ending ahead for the future. You knew it was your time to go but you've done it beautifully. The final lyrics ""If I could start again, a million miles away. I would keep myself, I would find a way"" describes how a career and the man you were. This piece of music describes who you were. Closing the piano at the end is a casket closed. We all miss you Johnny."	Hurt
658	James Wilson	At 67 years old and having lost both my parents, father in law, and my best friend I find myself reflecting back more and more these days. I can feel his pain when he sings! Maybe we should all try to be a little more kind to those we love, life is much too short!	Hurt

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way	Hurt

674	Gerry James	Just goes to show‚Ä¶.Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes at the end of his life, as an appeal to successive generations, to learn before it‚Äôs too late. We see our own suffering and despair now (through Trent), and see through Johnny that it doesn‚Äôt end with experience, and through Solomon that only God can interrupt that downhill slide. Old or young, we all suffer through this life.	Hurt

702	tripgreat	One of the most devastating news bulletin on Nashville radio was the announcement of Johnny Cash's death. It wasn't totally unexpected, when you knew June Carter Cash had passed away, it seemed almost inevitable. Still, it hit like certain deaths of people that seem they have always been, and will always be. Elvis, Dan Fogelberg, Jack Benny, Mary Tyler Moore, Ray Charles. Like the sun will stop shining, and the stars will no longer light the skies. The world goes on, but seems somehow diminished.	Hurt

715	farvista	"This became a novel. Read it or don't. 20 yr. old me really didn't know a thing. 60 yr. old me has memories of young relatives who ODed, leaving 4 little girls under the age of 10 behind, of hearing ""The baby has Downs"" when my SIL had her first child near Christmas eve, of a cousin who made the calculated choice to drink himself to death on a different Christmas eve, of holding my own 2-year-old while my husband told me ""I have a brain tumor"". (That one turned out okay, but in such a circumstance, you get an ICE-COLD, DISTILLED SHOT of what is actually IMPORTANT.) So many other memories, and yet so much less than SOME people have gone through. Job losses, bitter disappointments, infidelity and divorces, terrible accidents, mistakes made, opportunities missed, roads not taken. Eventually, even the most successful people become well-acquainted with loss and regret. And that's okay. These are inevitable. My parents remember 6 weeks spent in a children's ICU, part of a terrible club of desperate parents waiting to see who would take a child home. Their outlook was not good, but nobody else's was either. Accidents, illness, one set of parents who spoke no English, hoping that the doctors in Houston could help their child who had leukemia, and my mother, who spoke Spanish, translating for the doctors that the best that they could do was to make him comfortable, that they needed to say goodbye, that there was no hope. Finally, their child's heart problems + viral pneumonia zeroed out, and a doctor came to THEM and said ""I'm sorry, your baby has died."" While that news was being delivered, however, some doctors decided since that they had nothing to lose, they would take a shot in the dark, try something crazy, and they somehow managed to resuscitate the child, then get her stabilized. (She was fine, eventually.) THAT ONE MOMENT when they they had been told that their child was DEAD, and later, when that horrible, final news GOT TAKEN BACK had an effect on every single choice my dad and mom ever made for the rest of their lives. My mother's motto became ""If everyone is okay, the rest, we can fix."" They saw the true worth of joy, and gratefulness. They NEVER missed a chance to laugh and dance, to spend time, to say ""I love you"". Let me tell you, that makes for one amazing childhood. Sometimes, we had next to nothing, but I always felt like we were so rich. Inevitably, there will be a time when everyone is NOT okay, and you'll realize how perfectly that one phrase distills what actually matters. Why relive the ""good old days""? Live in them RIGHT NOW. When you're happy, KNOW YOU ARE HAPPY. Pay attention, be grateful, be joyous, and try to show that truth to others. Don't be one of those folks who say ""I wish I'd known how good I had it."" Be. Here. Now. Say ""I love you"". Go NOW, instead of tomorrow, when it might be too late. (Another bitter regret. I'm so, so sorry, Grampa.) Give to others in their need without keeping score. Abandon pettiness. Remember that you can argue with people and still love them. Never forget what truly matters. This is your life. Don't get so caught up in static and minutiae that you MISS IT."

784	 ‚Äî ùêÇùêÄùêëùêëùêàùêéùêç ùêíùêîùêç.	There is something very tragically beautiful about Johnny Cash's life. If there was one country musician I could name that transcended so many different genres and inspired everybody from rockers to popstars to rappers, it's him. I wouldn't say that the end of his life was the peak of his career - but it's very inspiring and bittersweet that he spent so many years in a slump after the 70s only for his music to find a new sense of love, relativity and acceptance with Gen X and Millennials. I've never been a believer in an afterlife, but if there is, I hope he's cozy somewhere and no longer struggling with feelings of depression and isolation.	Hurt
785	andy georgiou	His leaving song, what a Christian!!	Hurt
787	Plane Reality	What is amazing for me... I really related in many ways to the NIN cut. I never let it show externally. In those quiet moments alone... driving. I would wrestle with my internal conflicts... and that song defined a big part of it. I was in my young adulthood then. Fast foreword to now. Getting close to 50... I have lived through so so much. Tragic loss... horrible injuries... estranged loved ones... so so many regrets. I carried the world on my shoulders when young... thought I could change people... if only I loved them harder. Now looking back still constantly analyzing... finding my flaws... a meat grinder of things I can never go back to do different. Has it made me a stronger and better person... yes. I realize now slowly... to forgive. It is the only way foreword. To forgive myself... just because things were so bad... most of it is and was then out of my control. Do I still sit alone... sobbing some times. Yes. Slowly healing... learning how to Love. There was another Man that carried the World on His shoulders. Much Love and Blessings all! Jesus Christ is the Way/Truth/Life! üí™‚ù§üôèüíØ	Hurt

826	Tyson Thomas	Trent Reznor made a beautifully haunting song. Johnny Cash took it and ripped everyone's heart out! The pain in his voice says it all! Dang, even when Reznor sang it.... PAIN! Both are legends!	Hurt
827	rhys aston	I'm only 23 years old and have made quite a few mistakes that I sorly regret and brings me to tears whenever I think about them too much. This man was much older than I am and has definitely made a lot more life changing decions that I have even when he was my age. This is a man who has regretted many of them. I see this song as a confession of these decisions and as advice from a wise old man to be careful of your decisions and that living life to the fullest doesn't always mean having the finer things in life. Thank you for your wisdom Mr Cash.	Hurt
828	Bayne Bogdanov	Reznor can‚Äôt be mad!! Shit!! Johnny Cash	Hurt

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become?

839	Tea	Rest in Peace, Johnny	Hurt
840	frailty	"as someone who went from being a hobbyist video editor to a hobbyist musician, this music video is a masterpiece by the way it utilizes both. its not just the song that makes it so powerful, its the video as well, the way it cuts to videos of Johnny earlier in life over certain lyrics. People overuse the word ""haunting"" in my opinion but I cannot think of a more fitting description. it sort of stays and lingers in your mind for a while."	Hurt
841	Jim Rose	The vocals are great but something is wrong with the key in this version...it least that's the way it plays back for me Anyone else or am I losing it ?	Hurt
842	Suzanne	Love you Johnny	Hurt
843	Sephiroth Joutsen	As a hard core Nine Inch Nails fan, when this first came out, I didn't know what to think about it. Trent Reznor wrote it back in the mid 90's about his struggle with Heroin Addiction. I have grown to love this version and I understand why Trent signed over the rights of the song to Johnny Cash and his family.	Hurt
844	Jim Grant	IMO this is one of the greatest, arguably the greatest, music videos ever recorded. This is a true masterwork by Mark Romanek and Rick Ruben. Stunning.	Hurt
845	iTz Olie	What an incredible thing music is... for a cover of a song to convey a completely different meaning is just unbelievable. Thank whoever you need to that we have music because, I guarantee you, we wouldn‚Äôt be here without it.	Hurt
846	Flow Euphoria	It hurts to relate to this as much today as it did 12 years ago	Hurt
847	Jordan Garner	This song came on in the car on the night of my first date with my girlfriend who passed away by suicide recently. I still vividly remember her asking me the name of it and how she really liked it. So every time I listen to this song I think of her very deeply and my own hurt.	Hurt
848	Mr. Middleton	2:25 This song changed a lot for me, I see it as more than a cover which I‚Äôm sure a lot of people see it the same way. It‚Äôs a matter of realisation and regret and coming to terms with what you‚Äôve done and accomplished in life, I‚Äôm not old to where I can reminisce, but I‚Äôm old enough to know life is limited and will end eventually. I hope everyone who watches this music video and sees this comment has an amazing life as I may not meet you, but you all deserve amazing opportunities and outcomes. Be yourself and be happy	Hurt

851	garyryan52	I was raised in the 50 and 60s and loved Cash. My son was a Nine Inch Nails fan and when this video came out I explained a what the images were of. He looked at me and said this is the greatest video ever made. I told him it just told a story and that's what most Cash songs did.	Hurt

885	Frederick Coppenhagen	this song has gotten me through so much in my life. Just a reminder that even when you feel empty and alone, you go through hell just to make others feel love when you don't.	Hurt
886	Mike Ruzza	The first few notes give me tears. This song belongs to Johnny Cash now. Nine Inch Nails knows Johnny took it from them. Johnny was, and is the greatest sort of troubadore made in the U.S.A. Let's rename Tennesee johnny cash!!	Hurt
887	Paul Beaney	It scares me to get old. Not death, that's just time and time is both a friend and an enemy. What scares me is having the wisdom to look back on my life and judge myself. It scares me to have the foresight to close the piano and rest.	Hurt

897	bobsuruncle	"If anyone has an empire of dirt to show for the years of ""prospecting"" for gold and riches and fame, of finding it...

Not a perfect man... but he who is?"	Hurt

920	Reinhard Schuster	Straightforward, faithful and honest to the end. My very greatest respect Johnny.	Hurt
921	JoeyGemini63	The song is an apology to June for all the pain he caused her because of his drug addictions throughout their life together. He knows he doesn't have much time left to tell her he is sorry. Trent, you are an earth angel for giving Johnny this song. No one needed it or deserved it more that he did. It couldn't have gone to a more appropriate music man. No one else could have performed Hurt so powerfully and true. The age in his voice made him sound better than ever.	Hurt

957	ItsMeGPZ	This is a man at the end of his life, every choice behind him, wracked with grief after the loss of his wife, that is so incredibly sad, this is the only song I've cried about. When you're in your 20s, you can turn things around. A man with so much talent had his success cut short, and this is his ballad to the past. The loud bits are heavier than any weight you could lift.

975	Jennifer LeBlanc	I used to revere this man & cried to this particular song but as I got older I realized as painfully beautiful as it is it is a narcissistic anthem. He only suffers as his vessel/ body breaks down but he broke many hearts, souls & kin on his downward spiral to his ascendance. Don't get me wrong I love his music but had realizations of his pandering arrogance. He is only regretful now because of those he harmed (ardent fans, family, mama, the downtrodden, the church, IRS & his many children) are left to question ‚ùì I will still listen to the music but hear it with a different pair of ears. I mean take the song about him stealing car parts off the assembly line? Iffin he was a black guy he'd have died in jail. This is a modern Grimms Fairytale.	Hurt

1007	Nash Brooklyn	that beating pulsing note hurts everyone who still has soul inside -	Hurt
1008	Vemost	Trent Reznor wrote a masterpiece. Poets like Trent and Johnny are of another breed. They can somehow turn the spoken word, into something tangible. Transporting us through time. Spilling their souls out for all to see. We're scared at what we're about to witness, but we must learn. They're warning us . Life isn't easy, and time is fleeting. So follow your Bliss young people!! This aint no dress rehearsal!	Hurt

66	OJOK HERMINA	The most heart warming thing about ABBA is the courage to sing about a real life experience. I don't know how Agnetha could do it when her dream love life was falling apart, she could not know how that vulnerability was to impact so many and show them how to move on graciously after heart break. Abba the group just blessed us with their clear, clean version of ballads that any age group and any nationality could enjoy. They hit East Africa like a bombshell when we were in High School and at sixty we still rock to their golden oldies! May Yahweh bless them with His Light..,üôèüèæüíï	The Winner Takes It All

399	Kristen Lee	"I didn‚Äôt know this. But you can see it in her eyes. Nobody really knows the pent-up feelings behind the words of this song, ""Winner Takes All"", which this ABBA vocalist recorded with her resplendent soprano voice, endlessly dazzling millions of fans; but behind this moving song hid the melancholy and broken heart of Agnetha F√§ltskog for her separation from Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, whom she met shortly before forming the group ABBA, along with Benny Anderson and Anna Frida Lyngstad, who in turn also they had married; Agnetha felt deep in her heart the sadness of the breakup, and in her voice no one guessed that she was torn by her sentimental tragedy, and yet she had the character and poise to sing this moving song."

41	Phil Hurtado	Back in the fifties, I saw the movie, and at that time channel 8 in San Diego had the daily news, with Tara‚Äôs theme as their back ground music. That‚Äôs when this music, Tara‚Äôs theme, became part of my history. I used to tear-up when ever it played, as it reminded me of how a way of life disappeared from history resulting from the civil war, hence the name of the movie‚Ä¶‚ÄùGone with the wind‚Äù!

44	Deathrow Inmate	I wondered why it was called Gone With The Wind ..... then the scene where all they had to eat was radishes. I understand why.	Tara's Theme

57	Sam	This movie has a grandeur all its own. The score is unforgettable. Who has not found himself humming it, as he goes about his day? The casting is sheer perfection, although I wish Olivia de Havilland were not quite such a milksop. I think I actually like Leslie Howard best, despite being permanently in love with Vivian Leigh. As for Clark Gable, he ceased being Clark Gable after this film was made. He's Rhett Butler, now and forever.	Tara's Theme
58	Ivan Lussich	I am an Uruguayan senior citizen. I saw this movie 3 times: in my teens, in my forties and in senior age. First two times it did not quite impress me, but last time I was thrilled to see Gable, Leigh and Howard's performances. And the picture overall is fantastic.	Tara's Theme
59	amour yvette	Great movie, great actors, great music and perhaps a lesson for mankind. Going through with your life‚Äôs even there are though things crossing your pad.

Vivien Leigh WAS Scarlett O'Hara, meaning that she was born to play that role. It was tailor made for her. Nobody else could've done the role justice the way that she did.	Tara's Theme

354	Kimberly Klaus	Melanie-the best friend that everyone should have. I loved her character and hated that she had to die. And, if Scarlett had been born just 100 years later, she'd be CEO of a major corporation and girls everywhere would look up to her for her business sense and how she succeeded in a man's world. Maybe not for her tendency to steal other girls' fianc√©es, but her other qualities. And how she realized too late what real love is. Ah well, tomorrow IS another day!	Tara's Theme

426	Kim Dossett	Frankly, HOLLYWOOD, we don't give a DAMN!!!!!! You've made untold millions upon millions of dollars off of this movie with rereleases, videos and CD's since the original was released in 1939. Gable never got a fricken dime from the role. That's right people, not a dime. Gable was contracted to another studio at the time and they took his pay and royalty rights. Of course they are greedy bums too. Seventy fricken six years should be enough profits. Drop the copy right. Let the world enjoy this classic piece of history. You whiny,greedy bums.	Tara's Theme
427	Kim Dossett	Remember picnics under the tree that Scarlett swore to never go hungry again when I was a small boy. In Georgia.

487	Paul Herring	With respect, it was the American Civil War in Gone With The Wind, not the War of Independence. It's called the Revolutionary War in the USA.

492	William Brick	Sadly no! The actress who played Bonnie was an actress named Cammie King who passed away in 2010 at the age of 76 from lung cancer.	Tara's Theme
493	Guiseppe Heat	I LOVE this movie and the book sooooooo much!	Tara's Theme
494	FyllingenOy	Dixie, the unofficial anthem of the south and the most popular song in the confederacy, was written by a northerner. It doesn't matter who wrote it, the only thing that matters is what the song is about. The same thing goes for the nationality of the actors.	Tara's Theme
495	TXRider	I was so sad when Bonnie (the character) died. :(	Tara's Theme
496	TXRider	Pardon?	Tara's Theme
497	niculae cristea	Tomorow it's another day!	Tara's Theme
499	Harry Lube	That means hi in spanish!	Tara's Theme
500	SZealot	But since when was Clark Gable British? He's all American. Olivia was a British-American (duel nationality/citizenship). Get your facts right please and why are being like that? Most comments are peaceful.	Tara's Theme
501	Tatsu1-4-4	Yeah and the main actors who are all British too. Strange that really. Clark Gable, Vivian Leigh, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard all playing the lead role for what is known as the most American of movies. Now that's funny.	Tara's Theme
502	Hendrick Wijaya Setiawan	Dream of peace....	Tara's Theme
503	Emily Rose	Beautiful :(	Tara's Theme
504	HM The Tsar of Russia	Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!	Tara's Theme
505	Daniel Kalban	Fine with me XD	Tara's Theme
506	Nolan Key	Can we just stop arguing and enjoy the music? I'm sorry if you got angry at me. But we all have views about how the Civil War started. Can't we just get along and listen to this beautiful movie score?	Tara's Theme
507	Daniel Kalban	Oh that's a bunch of BS. And two wrongs doesn't make a right. The South bullied their way for years, and they should be kept in their place still because they obviously still don't know how to act like civilized human beings.	Tara's Theme
508	Nolan Key	Did the Historians mention that the congressman was making fun of the South? I know they had their society built on Slaves. But how does that make it so they provoked the war? The North wasn't bullied by the South, The North practically ran the South and posted the unfair Tariffs in 1832 and 1828. South Carolina attempted to secede but the North scared them into coming back, So if anybody was the bully it was the North.	Tara's Theme
509	Daniel Kalban	Im sorry, but the South instigated this according to most historians. And one Southern Congressman literally BEAT a Northern one in the Capitol itself! The South brought it on itself. Besides, they hoisted themselves by their own petard by being an agrarian society built on the back of slaves. The South bullied the North, we fought back, and the South, like all bullies, ran away like a little bitch and karma was visited upon it.	Tara's Theme
510	Nolan Key	If they were getting their way the tariff wouldn't have even been released on the south and Abe Lincoln would have never gotten to be President. The North was basically bullying the South for a while and until the conflict of slavery was spoken of was when the North and the South started fighting.	Tara's Theme
511	Daniel Kalban	Sorry, but I'm speaking the truth. The South instigated it by literally firing the first shot after being spoiled brats getting their way for nearly 100 years and they reaped what they sowed: Utter Humiliation and Deserved Vilification	Tara's Theme
512	Nolan Key	I'm not a southerner and if you would study the facts I told you, You would find what I said to be correct.	Tara's Theme
513	Daniel Kalban	Sorry, but GOOD historians say otherwise. You lost. We won. Get over it.	Tara's Theme
514	Nolan Key	Sorry I was running out of characters. But with all the facts I had given you I proved that you can't truly have called the south the aggressors.	Tara's Theme
515	tessithegreat	epic book......epic movie.....	Tara's Theme
516	Daniel Kalban	"""Northern Aggression""? You were the guys who pitched a fit about losing an election, left the union, and fired the first shots! You were the aggressors!"	Tara's Theme
517	Nolan Key	This is my favorite movie score	Tara's Theme
518	ziggyboi1995	It was once a sovereign and independent nation, but we lost the War of Northern Aggression, so we had to rejoin the US, which is going to Hell in a handbasket if we don't get the National Debt under control.	Tara's Theme
519	kristi g	what do you mean 'rise again'? how has it fallen?	Tara's Theme
521	Jonas Junior	Wow, BRAVO! I totally agree with you. How can we get those old times back?	Tara's Theme
522	nicolas villegas	frankly my dear, i dont give a damn	Tara's Theme
523	aditistarr	Tears come to my eyes instantly when this is played	Tara's Theme
524	FyllingenOy	What about Dixie?	Tara's Theme
525	xxIluvyouguysxx	Actually, the song was composed by Max Steiner, who was from Austria.	Tara's Theme
526	teemo	She sadly died a few weeks ago ;(	Tara's Theme
527	2Dawgz	I wonder if that baby that played Bonnie is still around. She/he's be about 75.	Tara's Theme
528	Daddy- Agario	"In Italy this song has been used as the opening music for a political TV show called ""Porta a porta"" which is aired on rai 1"	Tara's Theme
529	Leandro Carlos	enfim alguem q reconheceu a musica kk	Tara's Theme

532	Janette Walker	Thank you so much. Lovely memory.	Tara's Theme
533	Linda Ranches	so nostalgic....its touching...emotional!	Tara's Theme
535	Mary H	Oh Scarlett!	Tara's Theme
536	HepburnLove	The greatest movie of all time, no doubt!	Tara's Theme
537	nicolas villegas	it was ingrid bergman who was supposed to play the lead role of scarlet o hara but unfortunately she backed out because of some other film commitments and vivien leigh got the role.	Tara's Theme
538	extremechaser91	i love the intro =P	Tara's Theme
539	TheEpona92	The funny thing about wind is that what it can blow away, it can also carry back to us in time.	Tara's Theme
540	lindelandable	Don't blame the people ,blame the movie makers ,who don't have the courage to make a real movie .The kids can't watch a film that hasn't been made.	Tara's Theme
542	Francesca Riley	I'm welling up too. It's so emotional	Tara's Theme
543	Sophie Evans	this song just instantly makes me well up	Tara's Theme
544	Hank Lukas	we use to have a movie show on tv here in New York, t was called The Million Dollar Movie, and they used this for programs theme. I heard on that program before I foundout it was from Gone With The Wind.	Tara's Theme
545	Hank Lukas	I love this song it is so outstanding. At points powerful.	Tara's Theme
546	shirley Chandler	the music,the story ,the stars= perfection thats never been repeated!!!!	Tara's Theme

551	littleone843	Beautiful! Thanks.	Tara's Theme
554	gwtwvivien	"As much as I know, in France GWTW was first premiered in 1947... after WWII- MGM sent a copy of the film to Paris, in 1940, but Hitler stole it- This is an Historical fact, also my grandmother, who was french, told me this- ""Waterloo Bridge"" with Vivien too was premiered in 1947- In Buenos Aires where I live, GWTW was premiered September 25 1940-"	Tara's Theme
555	Nicholas McCullough	That's not exactly true. Olivia de Havilland, (born 1916) who played Melanie, is alive, as well as Mary Anderson, (born 1920) who played Maybelle Merriweather, Alicia Rhett, who played India Wilkes, and is the oldest surviving cast memeber, (born 1915), and Mickey Kuhn, (born 1932) who played Beau Wilkes, are all still alive as of 2012.	Tara's Theme
556	gwtwvivien	The filming of GWTW began on January 1939- ended in October 1939. World premiere was in Atlanta: 15 December 1939-	Tara's Theme
557	ziggyboi1995	If the South were to ever rise again, this should be its national anthem.	Tara's Theme
558	Ryan Wilson	beautiful movie and soundtrack	Tara's Theme
559	gwtwvivien	exactly vivien was 25 in GWTW, and 37 in STREETCAR- GWTW,s filming ended in october, and vivien,s birthday was on november 5th. STREETCAR was filmed in 1950- so...36 to 37-	Tara's Theme
560	plaidcarogemm	Yeah, so I've heard. Perhaps most of the movies are actually better than they look, but there are still some pretty awful ones. And I know, trust me. My friends and I are huge fans of old music, that's pretty much what we come together for. But their love mainly stretches to the Beatles and no farther, I wish it did though. And are you serious? Wow, that's just stupid. I don't know what those people do with their lives, to be fair I don't know what I do either. but just wow.....	Tara's Theme
561	CowNamedMuffin	"""I swear, as god is my witness! I'll never be hungry again."""	Tara's Theme
562	CowNamedMuffin	and yet the sequel wasn't the same...	Tara's Theme
563	zooeyhall	"""Titanic"" is DRIVEL compared to this!"	Tara's Theme
565	Isis2410	This is real Hollywood. And that is gone. There is no more creativity. Today they make remakes, endless sequels or blockbusters with no heart. With actors with little to no talent. Of course there are exceptions, and I treasure those. But I rather keep on watching Gone with the wind or Casablanca. The REAL movies.	Tara's Theme
567	plaidcarogemm	Yes, those happened....	Tara's Theme
568	bigstar66	Which, ironically, was my favorite movie until I saw this. Titanic is an excellent movie too.	Tara's Theme
569	Tamara alsammaraie	unfortunately real movies ,real singers, real music,are all gone with the wind music movies like that should had more than 100 millions views ,but unfortunately most or many of people today listen and watch disgusting movies and songs	Tara's Theme
570	bigstar66	This is like the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.	Tara's Theme
571	bigstar66	'51, when she was 38 or so.	Tara's Theme
572	bigstar66	I live in Alabama, but always sided with the North when studying the Civil War in school, choosing the US over the South. I saw this movie thinking nothing could change my mind. In the first five minutes my mind was changed, and this theme perfectly sums of the glory and loss of what once was.	Tara's Theme
573	bigstar66	I dunno about 60's but she was still beautiful in Streetcar, and she was like 40 in that.	Tara's Theme
574	plaidcarogemm	Yeah, so I must've figured. I imagine she must've prettier, but hey, at least she's still here.	Tara's Theme
575	willis636	"Ehh, I didn't actually think the Dark Knight was particularly special on Zimmer's part. It served its purpose marvelously within the movie but, for me, fails to stand up on its own. Hedwig's Theme however, is one of the greatest pieces of film scoring of all time. Williams captures the entire magical world in a five minute song. Disney's ""Brave"" was the only soundtrack I have really despised, which modern soundtracks do you take issue with? (Btw I've had a crush on Natalie Portman since I was 8)"	Tara's Theme
576	plaidcarogemm	I know, there are many great composes out there. However, many of the movie soundtracks suck. I like the ones for the Dark Knight, Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes, and you know all the stuff. Oh, and the Pixar films, as from Michael Giachinno. And I said beautiful, not hot. To me, that's an entirely different level, and I never thought Natalie Portman was so gorgeous.	Tara's Theme
577	willis636	I respectfully disagree. I find the original soundtracks of the post-1960's era of film scoring brilliant, and extremely powerful. John Williams, Hanz Zimmer, Thomas Newman (especially Any Other Name), Rachel Portman, and Gustavo Santaolalla are just a few genius composers with stunning soundtracks. Also Natalie Portman is hot.	Tara's Theme
578	Emma C	I read this book in 4th grade and I have the movie....why oh why did the author have to die in the middle of writing the sequel???? :( and for some reason.....I used to be obsessed with Scarlett o'hara's eyebrows...?	Tara's Theme
580	bigstar66	Although what you said about actresses is completely true, you're missing the jewels that come out of today's cinema. There were bad movies back then, but they aren't remembered. You're not forced to dig through all crap that was produced in the Golden Age, because only the true classics have stood the test of time. Today however, both good and bad movies are in theaters, and you do have to look somewhat hard for the truly good ones. But there are some made every year.	Tara's Theme
581	izzy Honey	one of best movies ever.such a legend this movie.amazing.love this song <3 and Vivien Leigh was so talented and SO god damn GORGEOUS.amazing actress.one a kind.wish she was here still today :(	Tara's Theme

585	ThePendraGonKin13	this song takes me to places I've never been, like plantations and countrysides. I've watched this movie a dozen times :)))	Tara's Theme
586	rebecca mestica	I love this movie sooo much! So as the theme song...How I love Vivien Leigh, she has the most naive and beautiful face in the whole world!	Tara's Theme
587	Coffee Grass	I do too but today's age they are not practical.. Can you imagine going down to subway or riding a bus with them lol	Tara's Theme
588	UltimateGamerx24	I watched this for the first time yesterday, i was in awe the whole time an absolute masterpiece and one of my favorite movies.	Tara's Theme

595	Anna Wyn	"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" I can't help it. I hate Scarlett for pushing Rhett away! Why in God's name would you choose Ashley over Rhett anyway?!?! FOOL. Awesome film though. :')"	Tara's Theme
596	Bcutter	@1127zephyr Yes, and a horse and buggy is much better than a car.	Tara's Theme
597	SomedayWellFly	@Carlover0529 I'm currently in the car on my way back from having seen that! Fantastic show.	Tara's Theme
598	Genevieve Fisher	My mama sure did raise me right, I grew up watching this movie. My friend had never seen it, I just watched it with her for her first time yesterday. Seeing a young person with little interest in classic movies react so emotionally reminds me of what an epic Gone With the Wind really is.	Tara's Theme
