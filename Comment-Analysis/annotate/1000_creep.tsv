12	duda	"Whenever I hear this song my heart breaks. My grandmother passed away on June 1st of that year, I saw her die in front of me and I could do absolutely nothing, this song was playing on my headphones while she was dying in that hospital bed, after that day I was never the same. I feel like crap for not showing how special she was to me, she was the only one who supported me in everything, she was always by my side, even if I was wrong. now after that i don't see any reason why i'm still alive, i'm just living for her.. ""what the hell am i doing here?"""
13	Agus Azzel	🤟🤟🤟🤟🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍
14	Blue Couch Productions	"Sorry about my previous comment Mr. Head. I've since come to Jesus and realized I'm not that weird. My mom called me a creep but what does she know? She ain't special. I am. Anyway, keep on rocking dudes. Check out my friend Mizuno, he kinda got that ""radiohead"" vibe ngl."
15	Blue Couch Productions	bro, I was listening to this song, and I kinda felt like a weirdo. Maybe even a creep? call me crazy but I wish I was special. so fucking special. keep it up Mr. Radio, this a bop on jah. (Apologies to Jah, I ain't met him in person.)

22	UntitledKirk	I've always found it incredible that only 8 years later, they'd write albums like Kid A and Amnesiac. It's like they're an entirely different band on those albums. INCEREDIBLE musicians.

136	Саша Сотник	"I thought that nothing can kick me in and i really like. But i saw Joe Division's ""Ceremony"" by Tom York... And Radiohead became my favourite band. Their creation passed through all my life, i liked art of their first album, when i saw it on the internet, and even if i didn't understand some their songs, it was something unusual for me and took my heart, and it's cool"
137	Richard Geller	"When I was a teen I started relating to the lyrics but it got me down because I was harsh on myself.... But in the end , the ""I don't belong here"" would make me feel at peace, I just have to accept that this is who I am then, I thought. A few years later and real life experiences, when I hear ""I don't belong here"" I feel wow I was so harsh on myself for nothing, I am my friend and I love myself and tomo I will get better. It doesn't make sense because the lyrics don't talk about life, but anyways Thank you Radiohead♥"

It sounds just as good today as it did back then. Actually, I see how much better music told a story back then than it does now. Maybe it just seems that way because that's when I was younger and more impressionable.

296	Mehak Verma	I've been single my whole life. And for the past few years, I would come back and listen, over and over again...But now somebody likes me, and I like them. I think I might be entering my first relationship soon...so this time, when I listened to the song, it felt different, maybe it felt worse. I'm afraid to let him in. To tell him I'm a creep, because I'm afraid he'll run away. He'll know I'm a loser. He has no trouble opening up to me about his problems, but I would never tell him any of mine...

303	Jacqueline Dinan	Love you from Irish Jackie
304	Miguel	His acting is so fucking good and natural in this one, he's like angry that he can't have who he wants because he can't possibly be at level, so it becomes a sort of love-hate, he's fighting hard to accept that he can't blame, that there's no way around and has to let go. When he realizes that she runs away he breaks down crying like a baby, then after letting everything out, acceptance gave him peace. Best performance.

408	Michael Quint	My fav song and one of my audition song for artist ❤❤❤
409	Jen	I just read an article about the history of this song and Radioheads negative feelings about it. I did not know they disliked it , started calling it “ crap” and hardly ever played it. The clunks in the song are apparently one of the band members trying to “ ruin” it , and it flunked in the UK charts at first but was picked up by an American college station where it started to take off . It was first recorded as the band were playing it as a warm up song , without their knowledge , which is why is sounds so powerful because it was utterly self conscious. Interesting! Probably my one of my favourite songs ever and OMG are the band deaf? How can they hate this beautiful, melodic, touching , souring , magnificent and timeless song?

478	Hyung_yeong.wonchi.	"Siendo honesto soy un chico que perdió su camino y orientación desesperado en buscar una respuesta que no logro conseguir, desde muy pequeño tengo problemas para expresarme, a veces me daba envidia al ver cómo los demás niños, los chicos podían expresar ""tristeza, dolor, alegria, desagrado, ira etc"" me frustraba por que yo no puedo hacer eso siempre me costo decir lo que siento oh pienso y es algo que aun me duele ya que no lo he conseguido, lo más triste de todo es que desde muy pequeño empeze a depender de la música no solo para expresarme si no emocionalmente todo dependió de ello si estaba triste la música era quien me escuchaba oh si estaba alegre oh enojado todo y lo único que me escucho fue la música y nada más, son muchas veces que he soltado lágrimas y cuando lo hago me sorprendo por que ni yo mismo puedo comprender lo que siento y cuando me enamore por primera vez me dolió tanto por que es para mi difícil expresarme y siento que no merezco Amor y tampoco ser amado por que puedo llegar a lastimar a personas que no quiero lastimar."

But, it took a cover I heard of this song yesterday, to realize that this is a great “F”ing song! I am only sad that it took me so long to come to this conclusion. I seriously underestimated Radiohead.

638	Novu	Thom Yorke: I was going door-to-door telling people that “Creep” is a bad song when I found myself in a computer store. So I’m sort of sizing up the place, and all of a sudden I get this thought: What if a computer could go drive a car? Then I laughed, ’cause I got the picture of a computer drinking a pint and hanging out with his computer mates. Then all of a sudden I stopped laughing, because I got the idea of what if a computer could play guitar. I was transfixed by this idea. And that’s when I knew: We needed to do an album about that.

689	Thoughts and Slayers	I still can’t believe that it was recorded in one take. And Johnny was trying to mess up the recording with those dead notes before the chorus. The band was not intending to release it as a single, but EMI decided to. “My Iron Lung” is about the meteoric success of this song and the pressure to follow it up.

841	Deepanshu Premani	When you were here before, I couldn't look you in the eyes. - He has inferiority complex. You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry. You float like a feather, in a beautiful world - He sees that the rest of the people belong to this world and carry out their roles and life so gracefully and know how to act like a human. I wish I was special, you're so fucking special. - He thinks others are so special that they play out their roles in life so naturally and belong to the society whereas he feels like a weird person who's not wired for this life and doesn't know how to act. He doesn't what he's doing here in this life. He wishes he had control over this and is ready to give away anything to belong, have this perfect body/soul for this life. His soul feel unnatural in this environment called life and he's trying to express that.
