12	duda	"Whenever I hear this song my heart breaks. My grandmother passed away on June 1st of that year, I saw her die in front of me and I could do absolutely nothing, this song was playing on my headphones while she was dying in that hospital bed, after that day I was never the same. I feel like crap for not showing how special she was to me, she was the only one who supported me in everything, she was always by my side, even if I was wrong. now after that i don't see any reason why i'm still alive, i'm just living for her.. ""what the hell am i doing here?"""	Creep

To tell him I'm a creep, because I'm afraid he'll run away. He'll know I'm a loser. He has no trouble opening up to me about his problems, but I would never tell him any of mine...	Creep

1	Brandon Lewis Gaming	I think this was the best piece of pop art about death until Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlackstar‚Äù 12 years later	Hurt
2	Z K	The point of this song is beyond what many people think. He‚Äôs referring to his past life of fame , drugs and trophies as an empire of dirt that will fail you not only emotionally but you can‚Äôt take any of that to the grave, it‚Äôll give you pain and hurt especially in comparison to the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ that has victory over the grave. Jesus is the way the truth and the life. The 10 commandments are the moral law, you and I broke the law, but Jesus paid the fine. That is the whole purpose of the coming, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. To pay the wages that were due to us so that those who believe will be pardoned on judgement day. I believe this song has a sense of regret of choosing the life he chose in the past over the precious gift of salvation, when we know this truth and continue to indulge in sin, it‚Äôs as if we are nailing Jesus back to the cross. But I believe Johnny cash came back to the truth and entered glory with his Savior.	Hurt

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way	Hurt

I quickly find a copy, cue it up and sit in my teacher's chair - just - listening. Replaying it three times because I can't believe what I'm hearing. I've never, ever heard anyone sledgehammer their stake in the ground with such musical perfection. Johnny absolutely OWNED this song in every way. To this day, his version still has the same effect on me, and probably you as well."	Hurt

51	Sean Atherton-Feeney	The greatest compliment to a song writer is to have their song covered so well its authorship is lost and the global community forgets you wrote it. In that forgetting can be found, ironically, immortality. Thanks Trent and Cash.	Hurt

54	Dan Gennaro	You know, I was never a big fan of Johnny cash, never was a country fan at all, I said his music was too dark or sad, or depressing as a teen and young adult. Then you get older and life happens, where you find yourself in a dark pit, when everything is upside down, wrecked, and all of a sudden his music resonates so much more in my soul. Especially this song above all else. What a amazing anthem.	Hurt
55	Mike Freitag	I can‚Äôt even listen to it. üò¢	Hurt
56	David Cox	Cash's version of this song still makes the hairs on my arm stand up. 25 years ago, if someone suggested Johnny Cash was going to cover a Nine Inch Nails song, I would have said that's a stupid and even ridiculous idea. But my God, this song is at another level. So emotional it rips you apart.	Hurt

63	Autism Social Cast	Time forces the memory in its place. Instant gratification is only for the Cool Cats. Let me explain. Memory makes you want to go back to that feeling. Addiction, a terrible thing that the elite neurotypicals. Resistant to peer pressure unless it for its own petty gain, then force must be used, because natural selection never ends well for the monster. You will never take down the ringleader, you can persuade those around them to pull the trigger.	Hurt
64	DrMattDestruction	they lied to you about the minimum wage. if the minimum wage was $0/hour, you could've been hiring employees since you were 14. everyone can afford to work for $0/hour if the Universal Basic Income is in place. let's give everyone a guaranteed minimum income of $1,500ish USD/month. tretettetet	Hurt
65	christianlorre	It's so chilling. And so sad seeing how much he aged so badly. Brings out a lot lot of pain because I remember my mother and how much she changed in the last 25 years of her life going downhill so subtle until you realize how much is lost far too late.	Hurt

74	Clint Potts	I grew up listening to my dad listening to Johnny Cash. He had all the early albums and when he got in a particular mood, the Johnny Walker and the Johnny Cash came out. He'd sit in the dark listening to all of the old songs. When the music stopped and the lights went on, dad was himself again. Sometimes, you just need to feel some pain. I always respected Cash but it was this song that made me understand. This song made me a fan. Sometimes, you just need to Hurt.	Hurt

( 2 Corinthians 5:10 ) For we must all appear before the judgment seat of CHRIST, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.

One day I'm gonna buy me a truck just like my dads travel to whever the road takes me and blast Jonny Cash on the radio..	Hurt
81	Miss Deadite	parts of this song both the NiN version and his cover are basically the relationship I have in my head with my mental illnesses. At some point I make a new mistake and they feed off of each other over and over. Never ending pain for days or weeks. I get to a point where I shut down. The pain numbs and I can function again until the next mistake and it begins again.	Hurt

96	IAmManWithTheGun	He died just one year after performing this cover‚Ä¶	Hurt
98	Koheleth	I know he did A LOT of dope, but I just don't think that accounts for how poorly he aged. People of his generation surely aged poorly. I mean the man only live to be 71, would've been about 70 when he filmed this, but looked and seemed every bit of 90. Today 70-year-olds certainly don't look young, but they didn't age that badly in comparison. And today you'll find many people in their 60s who look pretty damned good. And I'm talking rock stars who partied hard like Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, Tommy Shaw, etc. There's a quite a few who have aged really well. But people do seem to age better, not everyone, but in general. I mean, that's why you have Tom Brady playing in the NFL at 45 and other athletes--fighters even--competing professionally into their 40s. I remember when Joe Montana seemed like an old man when he went to Kansas City in his 30s. Lot of genetic luck involved for sure, but it's important to take care yourself too, but it's amazing that even those who don't still seem to age better than the generations before them. Probably a lot of stuff in environment is better today, no lead in the paint or gasoline anymore, probably lots of reasons for it.	Hurt

107	JxrZ	Not only does this hit hard, you can feel the pain in Johnny Cash‚Äôs voice. All the things he probably wishes he done differently, just like any human on the planet. We all have regrets. It‚Äôs sad world we live in and no matter how hard we try, we still have them. I told myself I wasn‚Äôt gonna do drugs when I seen D.A.R.E, but that was a lie.

It's a dirty trick this life thing plays on us because if you are privileged enough to live a long life , you are also cursed enough to lose more loved ones. The best we can hope for is to enjoy them while they're here and honor their memories when they are gone. It's not all so morbid though. Life is a gift and , like everything it comes at a cost. ""I would rather have loved and lost than never loved at all"" is one of my favorite sayings. Enjoy the now."	Hurt

Abba the group just blessed us with their clear, clean version of ballads that any age group and any nationality could enjoy.

41	Phil Hurtado	Back in the fifties, I saw the movie, and at that time channel 8 in San Diego had the daily news, with Tara‚Äôs theme as their back ground music. That‚Äôs when this music, Tara‚Äôs theme, became part of my history. I used to tear-up when ever it played, as it reminded me of how a way of life disappeared from history resulting from the civil war, hence the name of the movie‚Ä¶‚ÄùGone with the wind‚Äù!	Tara's Theme
43	Soller Games	- Teacher Girafales! - Miss Florinda! - What a miracle you are here! - I came to bring you this humble little gift.. - Thank you very much! Don't want to come in for a coffee? - Wouldn't it be too much trouble? - Of course not, come in, please. - After you, miss.	Tara's Theme

57	Sam	This movie has a grandeur all its own. The score is unforgettable. Who has not found himself humming it, as he goes about his day? The casting is sheer perfection, although I wish Olivia de Havilland were not quite such a milksop. I think I actually like Leslie Howard best, despite being permanently in love with Vivian Leigh. As for Clark Gable, he ceased being Clark Gable after this film was made. He's Rhett Butler, now and forever.	Tara's Theme
58	Ivan Lussich	I am an Uruguayan senior citizen. I saw this movie 3 times: in my teens, in my forties and in senior age. First two times it did not quite impress me, but last time I was thrilled to see Gable, Leigh and Howard's performances. And the picture overall is fantastic.	Tara's Theme
59	amour yvette	Great movie, great actors, great music and perhaps a lesson for mankind. Going through with your life‚Äôs even there are though things crossing your pad.

135	Augh Bable	Vivien Leigh is like Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Rita Hayworth combined together. That is how much density she personified.	Tara's Theme
137	Young Raines	Another classic - Vivien Leigh & Clarke Gable - they no longer produce such epic movies. The story line is embedded in historical times during the turbulent Civil War era - a very sad part of our history indeed. Vivien Leigh is breathtakingly beautiful. Clarke Gable is such a charming gentleman.	Tara's Theme

167	Eileen Pollock	This was beautifully done, and the music was for once, appropriate. Every key scene brought back memories of the whole. GWTW is a classic and I hope it will always be shown. I was 9 years old when it first came to the movies in a rerun. I could hardly wait, as I'd read the book in second grade. It kept being rerun over a period of years.	Tara's Theme

As for HBO and the woke wankers who make up the company all I can say is it don‚Äôt give a damn‚Äô about your contrived indignation! You are just cowards who buckle at the first sign that some little pissant may get their feelings hurt! Grow some balls and stand up for the 99% of people who see this as a MOVIE! Pathetic losers. I hope you go broke!	Tara's Theme
173	Shambhala Libertalia Iram	My family kept watching this movie back home years ago via VCD, and today, my brother and I rewatched it again via HBO Max. It is indeed a timeless movie!
