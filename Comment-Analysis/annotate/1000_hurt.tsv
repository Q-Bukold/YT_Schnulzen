1	Brandon Lewis Gaming	I think this was the best piece of pop art about death until Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlackstar‚Äù 12 years later
2	Z K	The point of this song is beyond what many people think. He‚Äôs referring to his past life of fame , drugs and trophies as an empire of dirt that will fail you not only emotionally but you can‚Äôt take any of that to the grave, it‚Äôll give you pain and hurt especially in comparison to the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ that has victory over the grave. Jesus is the way the truth and the life. The 10 commandments are the moral law, you and I broke the law, but Jesus paid the fine. That is the whole purpose of the coming, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. To pay the wages that were due to us so that those who believe will be pardoned on judgement day. I believe this song has a sense of regret of choosing the life he chose in the past over the precious gift of salvation, when we know this truth and continue to indulge in sin, it‚Äôs as if we are nailing Jesus back to the cross. But I believe Johnny cash came back to the truth and entered glory with his Savior.

18	DAPICS	I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

20	Not so hunkey Monkey	This is the closest a song will come to making me cry and it was damn close
21	OscarDev	I will never forgive him for being impatient on that pause between the verses and chorus where Trent sets the tone, but here he just jumps it.

23	William Kennedy	I think Trent Reznor produced this. Powerful Try Gods gonna cut you down. Also powerful
24	Steven Wolf	9 inch nails
25	Steve Blundon	"The year is 2002. A guitar student comes in for his lesson and asks, ""Have you heard Johnny Cash's version of Hurt yet?"". I quickly find a copy, cue it up and sit in my teacher's chair - just - listening. Replaying it three times because I can't believe what I'm hearing. I've never, ever heard anyone sledgehammer their stake in the ground with such musical perfection. Johnny absolutely OWNED this song in every way. To this day, his version still has the same effect on me, and probably you as well."

51	Sean Atherton-Feeney	The greatest compliment to a song writer is to have their song covered so well its authorship is lost and the global community forgets you wrote it. In that forgetting can be found, ironically, immortality. Thanks Trent and Cash.
52	Dan R Goodnight	incredibly powerful and still causes a problem with my allergies
53	helmut23456	This song touches my soul.... Johnny's greatest work; he saved it for last~~~~
54	Dan Gennaro	You know, I was never a big fan of Johnny cash, never was a country fan at all, I said his music was too dark or sad, or depressing as a teen and young adult. Then you get older and life happens, where you find yourself in a dark pit, when everything is upside down, wrecked, and all of a sudden his music resonates so much more in my soul. Especially this song above all else. What a amazing anthem.
55	Mike Freitag	I can‚Äôt even listen to it. üò¢
56	David Cox	Cash's version of this song still makes the hairs on my arm stand up. 25 years ago, if someone suggested Johnny Cash was going to cover a Nine Inch Nails song, I would have said that's a stupid and even ridiculous idea. But my God, this song is at another level. So emotional it rips you apart.

63	Autism Social Cast	Time forces the memory in its place. Instant gratification is only for the Cool Cats. Let me explain. Memory makes you want to go back to that feeling. Addiction, a terrible thing that the elite neurotypicals. Resistant to peer pressure unless it for its own petty gain, then force must be used, because natural selection never ends well for the monster. You will never take down the ringleader, you can persuade those around them to pull the trigger.
64	DrMattDestruction	they lied to you about the minimum wage. if the minimum wage was $0/hour, you could've been hiring employees since you were 14. everyone can afford to work for $0/hour if the Universal Basic Income is in place. let's give everyone a guaranteed minimum income of $1,500ish USD/month. tretettetet
65	christianlorre	It's so chilling. And so sad seeing how much he aged so badly. Brings out a lot lot of pain because I remember my mother and how much she changed in the last 25 years of her life going downhill so subtle until you realize how much is lost far too late.
66	Bradley Carrico	I really wanna know how this song came to be chose. So different from the normal Johnny Cash songs. What a cover! It‚Äôs no longer a 9 inch nails tune.

74	Clint Potts	I grew up listening to my dad listening to Johnny Cash. He had all the early albums and when he got in a particular mood, the Johnny Walker and the Johnny Cash came out. He'd sit in the dark listening to all of the old songs. When the music stopped and the lights went on, dad was himself again. Sometimes, you just need to feel some pain. I always respected Cash but it was this song that made me understand. This song made me a fan. Sometimes, you just need to Hurt.
75	Whitevaliantwarrior	üéº It doesn't matter who you are...Great, small or tiny, burnt out with nothing to your name. No matter what you have attained or all the money, fame and riches to your name. Because in the end you take nothing with you. All will stand before their Maker, Creator of all mankind, The highest, most mighty of any & everything. ( 2 Corinthians 5:10 ) For we must all appear before the judgment seat of CHRIST, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. ( Romans 14:12 ) So then each one of us will give an account of himself to GOD. ( Hebrews 9:27 ) And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment üôè üôå .

80	Delia Art	I remember fondly riding shot gun in ol' Nelly Bell my dad's second generation f series.. radio turned up with Jonny Cash. I always say with pride to this day that I grew up with the best music ever. I wish country music was the same. Oh the good times good days. One day I'm gonna buy me a truck just like my dads travel to whever the road takes me and blast Jonny Cash on the radio..
81	Miss Deadite	parts of this song both the NiN version and his cover are basically the relationship I have in my head with my mental illnesses. At some point I make a new mistake and they feed off of each other over and over. Never ending pain for days or weeks. I get to a point where I shut down. The pain numbs and I can function again until the next mistake and it begins again.
82	Sheenia S.A.R.G	This song makes u cry...I haft to say this is the sadest song Johnny Cash has ever sung its sad to see him and June gone They was the best country singers they will be missed..

98	Koheleth	I know he did A LOT of dope, but I just don't think that accounts for how poorly he aged. People of his generation surely aged poorly. I mean the man only live to be 71, would've been about 70 when he filmed this, but looked and seemed every bit of 90. Today 70-year-olds certainly don't look young, but they didn't age that badly in comparison. And today you'll find many people in their 60s who look pretty damned good. And I'm talking rock stars who partied hard like Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, Tommy Shaw, etc. There's a quite a few who have aged really well. But people do seem to age better, not everyone, but in general. I mean, that's why you have Tom Brady playing in the NFL at 45 and other athletes--fighters even--competing professionally into their 40s. I remember when Joe Montana seemed like an old man when he went to Kansas City in his 30s. Lot of genetic luck involved for sure, but it's important to take care yourself too, but it's amazing that even those who don't still seem to age better than the generations before them. Probably a lot of stuff in environment is better today, no lead in the paint or gasoline anymore, probably lots of reasons for it.

107	JxrZ	Not only does this hit hard, you can feel the pain in Johnny Cash‚Äôs voice. All the things he probably wishes he done differently, just like any human on the planet. We all have regrets. It‚Äôs sad world we live in and no matter how hard we try, we still have them. I told myself I wasn‚Äôt gonna do drugs when I seen D.A.R.E, but that was a lie.

Statistics for elderly suicides are 2nd in nation behind veterans. Johnny knew Jesus in early life, that early introduction to faith all but disappeared in his wild years, but allowed him to be forgiven his failures in his last years. ""I will never leave you or forsake!"" Christ Jesus"

179	Phil Richards	This is another great cover
180	Phil Richards	He was your grandmother's favorite
181	Renaider	"Until you (we) die , everyone goes before you. Then you leave someone when it's your turn. It's a dirty trick this life thing plays on us because if you are privileged enough to live a long life , you are also cursed enough to lose more loved ones. The best we can hope for is to enjoy them while they're here and honor their memories when they are gone. It's not all so morbid though. Life is a gift and , like everything it comes at a cost. ""I would rather have loved and lost than never loved at all"" is one of my favorite sayings. Enjoy the now."

244	Arnold Blashak	This is all about June Carter
245	Wes Baumguardner	Perhaps I am biased, but I prefer the original. Cash is so monotoned and almost expressionless throughout the entire song that it sounds almost robotic to me. Perhaps people take this monotone expressionless voice as a man coming to grips with his mortality in casual acceptance, which I understand, but I still do not think that makes it as exceptionally great of a performance as many people do.

Now, I pull up the video on YouTube and Jesus is in it again. Has anyone else recognized this?!"

323	Eternally Thankful 3771	This video of Cash doing Trent's song is just THE most emotional I've ever gotten over a music vid - it gets me EVERY SINGLE time I watch it. I in ZERO way want to detract from the song , but I didn't like it when NIN did it...just couldn't relate so it didn't reach me...ZERO hate or disrespect...it just didn't move me because of where I was at at that time. Then I watched a video interview about Cash wanting to do the song and Trent's ok with doing so...watched the video and I was floored....truly , whole-heartedly emotional...WOW !! The video and it's message speaks for itself and needs NO explanation from me as to why it is SO powerful. The ADDED power comes from my realization that Trent , not only by giving his permission to cover the song , but the arrival of Trent himself at a place where he can acknowledge another artist's greatness with the piece AND be completely happy with letting go of the song for Johnny's legacy - it just so much about how much Trent has grown as a human being and a man - I hope he realizes the beauty , growth and accomplishment of himself in this journey. Much respect to both artists , the video director and all who made this loving achievement possible.
324	LeeLee Me	Her face. Knowing this would be his last video. Knowing first hand what he had and lost to age and time. That blink said it all. You youngsters need to remember - where we go, you too will follow. Be kind to your elders. Learn lessons from them. One day it will be you counting down the last days.

356	BixLives32	"Johnny and June, June and Johnny. A matched set of two unique, individuals. Each had their own song writing style, quite different from each other. June probably wrote significantly more songs than Johnny. I have not heard a song written by either of them that I did not like, ...A LOT. I have not compared their publishing catalogues, but I am fairly sure that June's songwriting was more prolific. Johnny's great talent seemed to be his impeccable taste, and ability to find superior songs. Johnny Cash was able to uniquely interpret and perform a song so that the song would forever be identified with Cash. Despite this daunting ability, other performers continue to cover Johnny's interpretations of songs written by others. (I haven't that much courage). When Johnny Cash performed a song it was his forever. One oddity in Cash's career is ""The Folsom Prison Blues"". Even today, Johnny is listed as the song's writer. Nope. The song was written by Gordon Jenkins as the ""The Second Dream - The Conductor"" on the seminal, thematic album, ""Seven Dreams"" (1954) by Gordon Jenkins on Decca. I mention this because this was THE first microgroove, long playing record to boast a contiguous theme without the usual banding between cuts (like the Beatles, Sgt Peppers). Seven Dreams was a milestone and I recommend this record , ‚Äîif you can find a copy! It was released on CD, but the tapes were old and the digital master done poorly. I have a clean copy of the original Decca (""Unbreakable"") record, and have faithfully remastered it using professional gear. I wish I could give you all a copy. It remains an important record and quite enjoyable. I suspect that Johnny wrote his version of ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" shortly prior to the concert. That Cash used Gordon Jenkins music and lyrics as a vehicle for ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" was likely NOT a conscious act of plagiarism. I suspect that Johnny believed that he desperately needed new material that would relate to the prisoners and show them that he was NOT influenced by the prison authorities. Johnny simply substituted a few words to the Gordon Jenkins song, thus, forever branding the song his own. It's not important who wrote the song, but that Johnny had the taste and sense to make the song his own and appropriate for his unusual and dangerous audience. The inmate audience did NOT riot. There was even some mixing of black and white prisoners (unthinkable at that time). To a man, the inmates were well behaved and had a great time. Plus, Johnny was able to make the concert part of his personal moral statement that he felt was central to his life. Only Johnny Cash could have bought off this great performance. Any person, abused, tread upon, or who feels themselves injured, will find HEALING in Johnny and June's work. Oddly, many people thought Johnny had served prison time (not true); ‚Äîprobably confusing Johnny with Merle Haggard, as well as a couple of minor arrests Johnny suffered in two small southern towns while he was touring. They were errors of police judgement and Johnny was released in the morning. When touring back then, particularly in The South, most artists knew to stay close to the hotel (or private home, if they were a black artist). Jim Crow ruled for many years. If the prison officials had known about the song, I am sure they would have insisted that Cash NOT play the song. No joke, EVERYONE was scared out of their wits, prior to the concert. I am sure Johnny did not intentionally lift the song, plus, the original song was a 1 - 4 - 5 based blues. The Gordon Jenkins record was obviously an important work and heard by many people in the industry. Johnny would surely have heard the original. I have heard that Johnny financially settled with Decca and Gordon Jenkins as soon as he was informed of the plagiarism. The Folsom Prison concert was , perhaps, the bravest act of any performing artist in history. Columbia Records desperately tried to thwart the project, but Cash was intent. As he was selling a LOT of records, Johnny was able (barely) to make it all happen. The Folsom Warden and other CA State prison officials were also against the project. All the ""experts"" were predicting a riot. The movie did not show nearly the anxiety over the project. Moreover, Johnny and June were scared beyond any other concert they had performed. How Johnny and June manage to make the Folsom project happen is beyond me. If you like this music, have a listen to June's last few records, particularly, ""Press On"". The entire album works as a whole and could easily be labelled a masterpiece. ""Gatsby's Restaurant"", ""Tiffany Anastasia Lowe"" and ""I Used To Be Somebody"" are songs that I found unusually affecting and entertaining. Norman Blake's work is wonderful; ‚Äîsimple and pure soul. Marty Stuart is also on the record and plays as you would expect; ‚Äîperfect. The album sounds like people in a living room playing and having a nice evening. There is great humour, however, there are also points at which you might find yourself crying..."

371	Patrick O'Neal	I remember when this was played regularly on CMT in 2003. Clearly this video was shot before the passing of his wife, June Carter. I think this is one of the most powerful music videos ever made in ANY genre of music. I certainly think ‚ÄúHurt‚Äù has become his requiem.

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

Cash took the good lyrics and general structure and made a good song. *ducks from all the angry NIN fans*

435	ZAJ	I remember my mom being a fan of Cash. Lately I have been thinking about her again. Because despite the fact she walked out of my life with no regard for the family she was tearing apart, and how much I hate that she did that to me... I still loved her. And I've found myself tearing up sometimes when I listen to this song because, it's such a profound expression of regret and yearning. Often I've found myself struggling with the hole left inside of me because of my mom. It's led me down an unstable road due to how that deep loss struck my mental health. My mom might be someone else now. But I'm still here, right now, and I want to become something better despite how I lost her. I truly want to be someone better than what losing her the way I did had made me into. I end up drawn to this song, because I've done a lot of things to make people hurt, done things that I deeply regret, and I always yearn to start anew somehow. I want to find a way, like that closing lyric. It's strange how a song by an artist that my estranged mother loved, has still found such a deep comforting connection to me. It's simply reassuring, humbling, and profound.

So if you relate to this song because of sadness, despair, loneliness, hopelessness, regrets, addictions, failures, pain, relationship failures or any other dark emotion or experience.... please hear me... The God that Johnny knew and served loves you. He makes all things new. He even gives new hearts to those who turn to Him. He says to forget the past and look forward to an eternal future with Him in paradise. So please my friend - turn to Him.

It's a message that he was it making everything transparent? It got to me. I can't believe it will be 20 years since his death!!! N√£o acredito que ele faleceu em 2003, alguns meses depois que sua esposa faleceu. Essa m√∫sica √© sobre arrependimento? √â uma can√ß√£o de amargura? √â reconhecimento? √â uma mensagem que estava deixando tudo em pratos limpos? Isso me pegou!

The house was packed, for an impromptu! Small town.. News go quick! So we're in the front row and he sees us girls all gussied up in our Opry dance dresses and calls us up! We only danced to old bluegrass songs like Foggy Mountain Breakdown and such... But the band only knew The Devil Went Down to Georgia... So we got up and danced to that üòÅüíï Johnny and June were so gracious and lovely. He even signed my dance shoe after we performed. Most memorable experience in my life... Besides giving birth to my 2 beautiful children and also meeting Mikhail Barishyshikov.. And he signed my ballet shoes too!

560	ŒíŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒûŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ	Perhaps the greatest cover of a song ever, right next to All Along the Watchtower and Knocking on Heavens Door. The impact that the time period of Cash's life has in the cover is so massive. I've never heard a song that takes a bigger and harder hit each time I listen to it, as my time in this world passes. Truly amazing.
561	Roller Girl	Trent should see this song as flattery. Yes Johnny out did him and made it HIS song but for good reason. He was the OG. And as much as Trent has suffered in his life Johnny suffered more if only through age and experience. You can just feel the loss of his brother, growing up literally dirt poor, decades of drug addiction heartbreak and loss and more then anything? REGRET. He just wants to go back and start his life over when he‚Äôs so close to death. This would have been a good song for Elvis to cover too but he died a decade before it was written. It‚Äôs impossible to watch this without crying üíîüòû At least Johnny had his wife

Thank you for sharing your best song before leaving this world.Your out of pain, and sadness now. Enjoy eternity with your wife. Thank you, Best remake ever‚Ä¶.
598	Benzoxxcrystlexoxo	Fuck man this song will always remind me of my grandpa he is still alive but quickly deteriorating and it‚Äôs sad to see him slowly rot from Parkinson‚Äôs he loved Johnny cash and loved to sing his songs actually he was even born the same year as Johnny man this pain is not pleasant even being born in gen z (2005) I can still appreciate old music from legends like this

607	Liam	nicee
608	Todd Branston	Thanks much to Mr. Cash - this song serves as a reminder that I've come a long way. I no longer need to stick a needle in my arm. More than 42 years sober and I'm so grateful to the opportunity given to me by my grandparents.
609	zachman893	i infinitely like this version of hurt the best. so much emotion in johnnys tone, like hes reliving his past with every word.
610	Peter von Feldt	R.I.P music legend. His music and my memories of his music still live on better than the crap movie documentary ever will.
611	Sheldon C Edward Thibault	Johnny was probably 70 at the time of the making of this video, he passed away at 71 in 2003! In this video Cash looks way older than 70, he looks like he's 85!
612	Alex Pazmino	The man myth the legend.
613	Kev Hill	This song by the 9inch nails was a great song already. But JC took it to new heights. A great song ending for an amazing man.
614	Brett Yon	I'm sitting here, smoking a cigarette and dreading going to work. Just listening to Johnny Cash and drinking coffee. Off to another new year, greeting it with blunt steel.
615	Byron Marmol	I just googled it and Johnny Cash had a stellium in piscis, with the ascendant there and a Mercury in joy but in Fall/Detriment there in the 1st house, with the moon in Scorpio and Saturn in Rulership in the 12th house :( imagine feeling feelings that way!

623	J D	If I could do it all over again.I would start by being a better person.Because in this life I was not a good man.I lied.I hurt people.And with time all the people I loved and hurt ,died away.I would give my entire fortune to do it all over again.This time,I'd do it right.I would be a good person.I'd make it work. To me Mr. Cash was repenting all of his sins.To whom ever he may have hurt. And most of all to his maker.This song came along right as he was to die and it was a given that he sung it.
624	JWM	the goose bumps never stop
625	Samuel.J.Barker	"It's sad to me how so many have heard this, but not fully acknowledged the message. Johnny Cash lived a long life full of success and material wealth, in fact his life was overrun with the necessity to maintain his empire. At the time of the recording of Hurt, when Cash was 71, he'd realised the superficiality of it all. He'd reached the end of the line, looked back at his empire and saw it was nothing but dirt. What was worse is the fact, the higher the heights you reach, the harder it is you'll fall. Age is not kind to anyone, but someone dependent on image far less. If he could, he would trade it all to start again and keep HIMSELF. Fame and money won't embrace you when you're dying, neither will memories of roaring crowds or moments of success. The only thing that will embrace you when you're on your way out, is the loved ones you've made in your life. A life of fame and wealth is a life that makes this a very hard thing to achieve. Yet nowadays it's more aspired to than it ever has been before. Cash learned the hard way, he was trying to warn you. ""Keep to yourself"" I won't reach the end of the line having chased fame to the top and roil under the pressure of the fall"
626	Undertaker67203	This song still fills me with strong emotions barely under control. Never has two versions of one song conveyed such strong but differing views. Trent was young barely keeping it together. Johnny was at the end, seeing his life in the rear view and knowing not much time lay ahead. Both versions are so powerful.
627	furious warfare	continue comme ca c parfait ils faut plus de personne comme toi
628	Izzy Meadows	Rip you legend of a man. This is the version of this song. Fact
629	jennifer taylor	I remember when I first saw this amazing video, it was newly released on MTV and I got up after, amazed, but sad.. thinking wow.. he doesn‚Äôt look so good. Thinking, with June gone, I‚Äôm sure he wanted to be with her. Went to the bedroom and came out to hearing it announced that Johnny Cash had passed away.. I was dumbstruck‚Ä¶devastated and deeply saddened such an icon that I‚Äôve ‚Äúknown‚Äù since I was a small child was gone.
630	Charles Kiel	Magnificent. Simply Magnificent
631	K√©vin Atengana	The 'book of love effect'

637	craig mcmillan	John was a very troubled man
638	RAP 4Live	Every time I hear this song I get tears in m eyes...
639	MaddawgMar MMA Takes	The fact that Reznor was young when he wrote this and recorded it was sad that he faced all that at such a young age. But for Cash to record it at the end of his life made it that much more sad, as there was no time to change it. It added a depth of sadness to an already sad song. Both artists are geniuses

657	Isaiah Voss	"20 years this year it would've been since you've been gone Johnny. This is your swan song. This is every man's song of regret from their past but has a beautiful ending ahead for the future. You knew it was your time to go but you've done it beautifully. The final lyrics ""If I could start again, a million miles away. I would keep myself, I would find a way"" describes how a career and the man you were. This piece of music describes who you were. Closing the piano at the end is a casket closed. We all miss you Johnny."
658	James Wilson	At 67 years old and having lost both my parents, father in law, and my best friend I find myself reflecting back more and more these days. I can feel his pain when he sings! Maybe we should all try to be a little more kind to those we love, life is much too short!

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

Old or young, we all suffer through this life.

701	DarkMarxSoul	Singing about everyone going away in the end is brutal, whether it's a younger person singing about loved ones abandoning them to their depression or an old person singing about loved ones dying.
702	tripgreat	One of the most devastating news bulletin on Nashville radio was the announcement of Johnny Cash's death. It wasn't totally unexpected, when you knew June Carter Cash had passed away, it seemed almost inevitable. Still, it hit like certain deaths of people that seem they have always been, and will always be. Elvis, Dan Fogelberg, Jack Benny, Mary Tyler Moore, Ray Charles. Like the sun will stop shining, and the stars will no longer light the skies. The world goes on, but seems somehow diminished.

715	farvista	"This became a novel. Read it or don't. 20 yr. old me really didn't know a thing. 60 yr. old me has memories of young relatives who ODed, leaving 4 little girls under the age of 10 behind, of hearing ""The baby has Downs"" when my SIL had her first child near Christmas eve, of a cousin who made the calculated choice to drink himself to death on a different Christmas eve, of holding my own 2-year-old while my husband told me ""I have a brain tumor"". (That one turned out okay, but in such a circumstance, you get an ICE-COLD, DISTILLED SHOT of what is actually IMPORTANT.) So many other memories, and yet so much less than SOME people have gone through. Job losses, bitter disappointments, infidelity and divorces, terrible accidents, mistakes made, opportunities missed, roads not taken. Eventually, even the most successful people become well-acquainted with loss and regret. And that's okay. These are inevitable. My parents remember 6 weeks spent in a children's ICU, part of a terrible club of desperate parents waiting to see who would take a child home. Their outlook was not good, but nobody else's was either. Accidents, illness, one set of parents who spoke no English, hoping that the doctors in Houston could help their child who had leukemia, and my mother, who spoke Spanish, translating for the doctors that the best that they could do was to make him comfortable, that they needed to say goodbye, that there was no hope. Finally, their child's heart problems + viral pneumonia zeroed out, and a doctor came to THEM and said ""I'm sorry, your baby has died."" While that news was being delivered, however, some doctors decided since that they had nothing to lose, they would take a shot in the dark, try something crazy, and they somehow managed to resuscitate the child, then get her stabilized. (She was fine, eventually.) THAT ONE MOMENT when they they had been told that their child was DEAD, and later, when that horrible, final news GOT TAKEN BACK had an effect on every single choice my dad and mom ever made for the rest of their lives. My mother's motto became ""If everyone is okay, the rest, we can fix."" They saw the true worth of joy, and gratefulness. They NEVER missed a chance to laugh and dance, to spend time, to say ""I love you"". Let me tell you, that makes for one amazing childhood. Sometimes, we had next to nothing, but I always felt like we were so rich. Inevitably, there will be a time when everyone is NOT okay, and you'll realize how perfectly that one phrase distills what actually matters. Why relive the ""good old days""? Live in them RIGHT NOW. When you're happy, KNOW YOU ARE HAPPY. Pay attention, be grateful, be joyous, and try to show that truth to others. Don't be one of those folks who say ""I wish I'd known how good I had it."" Be. Here. Now. Say ""I love you"". Go NOW, instead of tomorrow, when it might be too late. (Another bitter regret. I'm so, so sorry, Grampa.) Give to others in their need without keeping score. Abandon pettiness. Remember that you can argue with people and still love them. Never forget what truly matters. This is your life. Don't get so caught up in static and minutiae that you MISS IT."

733	Danny Thomson	as a man who had a stroke in 2014 caused by heroin addiction, this song wrecks me and turns me into a bag of bubbling emotion every single time! every single line means something to me and my broken life, the line about the needle tearing a hole is especially meaningful to me. R.I.P. Johnny Cash.
734	G B	Everyone I know goes away in the end. Truer words have never been spoken.

737	Graham Richardson	For me, this is without doubt, the single greatest cover version of all-time. Absolutely stunning.

761	Hogsqueal	seems about right that one of country music's biggest songs is a cover from a different genre
762	Clyde Scott	Still playing it in 2023
763	James Holbrook	The song doesn't make.much sense from a 20 something year old but this is perfect
764	TheEnjoyitall	This man knew how good this song was. This is his show piece, his swan song. The depth and meaning he showcased on this recording shows that even when you're not in the immediate limelight you can still blow people away by creating one of the best covers ever done. Truly, what a masterpiece from all who created it, starting with Trent Reznor.

779	Wesley Nichols	Saying you have regrets at 20 doesn't really mean much, you have your whole life to figure it out. But when you're Johnny's age and talking about regret, it has a whole new meaning. Johnny Cash is one of the GOAT's.

784	 ‚Äî ùêÇùêÄùêëùêëùêàùêéùêç ùêíùêîùêç.	There is something very tragically beautiful about Johnny Cash's life. If there was one country musician I could name that transcended so many different genres and inspired everybody from rockers to popstars to rappers, it's him. I wouldn't say that the end of his life was the peak of his career - but it's very inspiring and bittersweet that he spent so many years in a slump after the 70s only for his music to find a new sense of love, relativity and acceptance with Gen X and Millennials. I've never been a believer in an afterlife, but if there is, I hope he's cozy somewhere and no longer struggling with feelings of depression and isolation.

787	Plane Reality	What is amazing for me... I really related in many ways to the NIN cut. I never let it show externally. In those quiet moments alone... driving. I would wrestle with my internal conflicts... and that song defined a big part of it. I was in my young adulthood then. Fast foreword to now. Getting close to 50... I have lived through so so much. Tragic loss... horrible injuries... estranged loved ones... so so many regrets. I carried the world on my shoulders when young... thought I could change people... if only I loved them harder. Now looking back still constantly analyzing... finding my flaws... a meat grinder of things I can never go back to do different. Has it made me a stronger and better person... yes. I realize now slowly... to forgive. It is the only way foreword. To forgive myself... just because things were so bad... most of it is and was then out of my control. Do I still sit alone... sobbing some times. Yes. Slowly healing... learning how to Love. There was another Man that carried the World on His shoulders. Much Love and Blessings all! Jesus Christ is the Way/Truth/Life! üí™‚ù§üôèüíØ
788	Alain Brisson	This is so emotional and powerful, I can‚Äôt tell how my feelings are when I listen to this masterpiece. Absolutely beautiful!

793	Mansur Haq	Amazing lyrics! Such a deep and moving masterpeice..
794	Beau Stange	GREAT video! I was a Nine inch Nails fan and enjoyed some of Johnny‚Äôs early work. I honestly don‚Äôt know if I discovered this song by Johnny for about 5-7 years after it came out. When I‚Äôm feeling the pain of everyday life I‚Äôll listen to it at the gym to remind me that many have suffered far worse. Thank you!

827	rhys aston	I'm only 23 years old and have made quite a few mistakes that I sorly regret and brings me to tears whenever I think about them too much. This man was much older than I am and has definitely made a lot more life changing decions that I have even when he was my age. This is a man who has regretted many of them. I see this song as a confession of these decisions and as advice from a wise old man to be careful of your decisions and that living life to the fullest doesn't always mean having the finer things in life. Thank you for your wisdom Mr Cash.

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

840	frailty	"as someone who went from being a hobbyist video editor to a hobbyist musician, this music video is a masterpiece by the way it utilizes both. its not just the song that makes it so powerful, its the video as well, the way it cuts to videos of Johnny earlier in life over certain lyrics. People overuse the word ""haunting"" in my opinion but I cannot think of a more fitting description. it sort of stays and lingers in your mind for a while."
841	Jim Rose	The vocals are great but something is wrong with the key in this version...it least that's the way it plays back for me Anyone else or am I losing it ?
842	Suzanne	Love you Johnny
843	Sephiroth Joutsen	As a hard core Nine Inch Nails fan, when this first came out, I didn't know what to think about it. Trent Reznor wrote it back in the mid 90's about his struggle with Heroin Addiction. I have grown to love this version and I understand why Trent signed over the rights of the song to Johnny Cash and his family.
844	Jim Grant	IMO this is one of the greatest, arguably the greatest, music videos ever recorded. This is a true masterwork by Mark Romanek and Rick Ruben. Stunning.
845	iTz Olie	What an incredible thing music is... for a cover of a song to convey a completely different meaning is just unbelievable. Thank whoever you need to that we have music because, I guarantee you, we wouldn‚Äôt be here without it.
846	Flow Euphoria	It hurts to relate to this as much today as it did 12 years ago
847	Jordan Garner	This song came on in the car on the night of my first date with my girlfriend who passed away by suicide recently. I still vividly remember her asking me the name of it and how she really liked it. So every time I listen to this song I think of her very deeply and my own hurt.
848	Mr. Middleton	2:25 This song changed a lot for me, I see it as more than a cover which I‚Äôm sure a lot of people see it the same way. It‚Äôs a matter of realisation and regret and coming to terms with what you‚Äôve done and accomplished in life, I‚Äôm not old to where I can reminisce, but I‚Äôm old enough to know life is limited and will end eventually. I hope everyone who watches this music video and sees this comment has an amazing life as I may not meet you, but you all deserve amazing opportunities and outcomes. Be yourself and be happy
849	magnolia Nunn	Love him....üíï
850	Sunshine Moon	Listen to Johnny Cash's sings before he had passed you can have my empire but you have dirt meaning he was I can relate leeches people just wanting everybody it's anyway I don't have to explain myself those who are older maybe we'll understand those
851	garyryan52	I was raised in the 50 and 60s and loved Cash. My son was a Nine Inch Nails fan and when this video came out I explained a what the images were of. He looked at me and said this is the greatest video ever made. I told him it just told a story and that's what most Cash songs did.

It couldn't have gone to a more appropriate music man. No one else could have performed Hurt so powerfully and true. The age in his voice made him sound better than ever.

932	GruesomeGreenWitch	Most incredible, beautiful, humane video. If people would understand how time will destroy everything they have and are, how broken and insne we all are, maybe we'd all treat each other better.üñ§üíî‚ù§‚Äçü©πü§ç
933	BRAINWASHED	If you dislike this you haven't experienced enough life to understand.
934	ammar Ali	What have I become, My Swedish friend
935	Mark M	Beautiful song. A lifetime, and he knows, being himself was the best he could've ever done. The memory he wanted to leave us? Be true to yourself, love heartily and remember, it is the people that count most. Not the empire of dirt we so often strive for. Thanks Johnny.
936	InfoScholar	RIP the good man. We remember you, great soul.
937	YHWH OMEGA	I focus on the pain and give it to God te only thing it‚Äôs real
938	J1M1 J3nkins	Trent Reznor who? If this wasn't the perfect song for Johnny Cash at the perfect time, we would never have experienced it like this. Thank you to Trent Reznor for creating one of the best Johnny cash covers ever.
939	pointdexteryeah	My brother was only 31 and died on hospice 3 months ago. I miss him dearly.
940	C. Mustard	Dedicated to Raamon Thomas. Guy turned his back on me at my worst. Love you ‚Äú brother ‚Äú

949	michael cooper	This version is so much better then nine inch nails and I can't stand cover versions of songs
950	Byron Hilyard	I heard this song back when in 2003. I absolutely bawled my eyes out. I had not cried like that in years. I never make it through this song without crying. When he visited his home from years past. That really digs it in deeper.

957	ItsMeGPZ	This is a man at the end of his life, every choice behind him, wracked with grief after the loss of his wife, that is so incredibly sad, this is the only song I've cried about. When you're in your 20s, you can turn things around. A man with so much talent had his success cut short, and this is his ballad to the past. The loud bits are heavier than any weight you could lift.

962	EJC	If I could start again , a million miles away, I would keep myself, I will find a way üôÇ
963	James Hall	Tears are rolling. RIP Johnny. fellow songwriter. You made us proud. RIP
964	archiveseeker	I was a big NIN fan. I know Trent Reznor agrees that Johnny Cash successfully hijacked this song.
965	Matryx	whats crazy is that most of Johnny's later songs are Covers. But they became his songs through the sheer emotion he conveys through the lyrics and music.
966	Victor Davidson	You‚Äôve found a way My brother You were an angel in disguise a friend Something I hope to be to someone or anyone the world thanks you mr cash
967	C	Meaning is amazing. I understand. I feel the same way. Thank you JC
968	Vulgarr the Viking	"I remember when this came out 20 years ago. I listened to it and said ""He sounds like he's saying goodbye."" A few months later he was gone."
969	Scott	You do what you got to do and then you look back...

971	MarcusDidiusFalco	Whenever I feel.... lonely, betrayed, abandoned - I come here. And I know I'm not walking this cold, long mile alone.
972	Daryl	John Franklin cash and I am a young man this is from Willie usserys son
973	xela	Cette chanson transcende le temps et l'esprit
974	Stuttering Cris	Whay have I become my Swedish friend? What? ü•∫ü•∫üòîüòîüíî
975	Jennifer LeBlanc	I used to revere this man & cried to this particular song but as I got older I realized as painfully beautiful as it is it is a narcissistic anthem. He only suffers as his vessel/ body breaks down but he broke many hearts, souls & kin on his downward spiral to his ascendance. Don't get me wrong I love his music but had realizations of his pandering arrogance. He is only regretful now because of those he harmed (ardent fans, family, mama, the downtrodden, the church, IRS & his many children) are left to question ‚ùì I will still listen to the music but hear it with a different pair of ears. I mean take the song about him stealing car parts off the assembly line? Iffin he was a black guy he'd have died in jail. This is a modern Grimms Fairytale.
976	Peter Richmond	What an absolute masterpiece
977	Maria Kavanagh	Rest in peace Sir. Cash you absolute fucking legend
978	AxiomExotic	I remember first hearing this in the trailer for Prototype 2, and i instantly fell in love :D
979	Ricky Strauss	Well said....go with god!
980	Callum Clarke	Rest in peace brother in Christ Jesus lord and saviour. You are in peace in Christ finally
981	Luca Vagnarelli	Most poetic farewell ever

988	p W	Bono said it best, Trent was born to write this song, Johnny lived to sing this song.
989	Marcelo luna	Un grande... el se√±or jhonny cash hermosa cancion
990	My Dog Is Bipolar	This really is the greatest cover ever.
991	Ole Riis-Vestergaard	Epic - Rest In Peace Johnny man what a journey you took us all on you Will be missed here on earth
992	Ezy Jamez	Listened to this song over many a number of occasions. And it reminds me of the mess-ups I have done that has lead me to this day. Listening to this reminds me how much I have done wrong to others and myself. 2 Legends sing this song, and both convey such meaning that hits deep down.
993	Jutta Muthig	Er war im Alter fast noch tiefgr√ºndiger
994	Wan Ontalay	"""Hurt"" is somehow connected to this song in my mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_DVS_303kQ&list=RDp4zluA60hjs&index=9"
995	Alyssa Martinez	This song will always make sense when nothing else doezz
996	Connie Markley	I love this song and Johnny cash he is and always will be a legend
997	A megalodon with internet access	Thank you johnny cash you saved my life with this song during 2008 i was going through a very dark time my wife had left me my son came out as a gay and my president lost to a black man im very glad you released this song i was really hurt seeing a dirty a negro in office and hearing this song really made me feel empowered and proud of my white heritage i was in arkansas and passed through your the town of your birth on my way to harrison the headquaters of the kkk to pay my respects i was blasting this song all the way there!!!! i am dissapointed that you dated a negro in the 1960s but thats okay we all made mistakes. Thank you again
998	megalo maniac	i never liked music like this till i heard this song im 33 and have the pain of most men before they die
999	MysteryMan	I'm a good enough looking dude,with decent enough social skills, people try to interact with me,but they don't know this song is literally me
1000	raymon kravagna	Maybe the saddest song ever. Tears my heart out to see him like this.
1001	Dave P	You can see the broken man...the stroke. Tell me you don't, and I'll call you blind.
1002	Dave P	I don't want to be old. I think Johnny taught me that.
1003	Lord Drakkon 7367	The cover that went so hard everyone forget it was a cover
1004	Mee Here	FJB AN IT'S CARTEL,
1005	gerkenator	I appreciate how he made this song his and shows at the end our flaw as people. We killed our creators flesh. Johnny Cash clearly got it.
1006	Red Skywalker	Everyone of us is broken & beyond repair..so much that God sent his only begotten son to die for our transgressions as John 3:16 declared
1007	Nash Brooklyn	that beating pulsing note hurts everyone who still has soul inside -
1008	Vemost	Trent Reznor wrote a masterpiece. Poets like Trent and Johnny are of another breed. They can somehow turn the spoken word, into something tangible. Transporting us through time. Spilling their souls out for all to see. We're scared at what we're about to witness, but we must learn. They're warning us . Life isn't easy, and time is fleeting. So follow your Bliss young people!! This aint no dress rehearsal!
