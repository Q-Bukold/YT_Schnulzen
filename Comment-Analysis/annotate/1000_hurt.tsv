1	Brandon Lewis Gaming	I think this was the best piece of pop art about death until Bowie’s “Blackstar” 12 years later
2	Z K	The point of this song is beyond what many people think. He’s referring to his past life of fame , drugs and trophies as an empire of dirt that will fail you not only emotionally but you can’t take any of that to the grave, it’ll give you pain and hurt especially in comparison to the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ that has victory over the grave. Jesus is the way the truth and the life. The 10 commandments are the moral law, you and I broke the law, but Jesus paid the fine. That is the whole purpose of the coming, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. To pay the wages that were due to us so that those who believe will be pardoned on judgement day. I believe this song has a sense of regret of choosing the life he chose in the past over the precious gift of salvation, when we know this truth and continue to indulge in sin, it’s as if we are nailing Jesus back to the cross. But I believe Johnny cash came back to the truth and entered glory with his Savior.

5	Joe Stevens	The older I get the harder this song hits. ❤
6	Neil Menzies	Love this most honest song I've ever heard ✌️
7	John Sagsveen	This is one of the most metal pieces of art I've ever seen
8	Marc van der Kruis	@Jesus Cespedes No way dude... I literally JUST did Arthur's final mission 2 minutes ago... and I needed to listen to this song... talk about coincidence....
9	Олег Михалап	Nice song
10	27neverlose	What an incredible song. It's amazing how every verse has the meaning of our past life and the death that awaits us all....
11	Jesus Cespedes	This song would’ve been great for red dead 2 when Arthur dies
12	VicGeorge2K6	My father just passed away recently (1940 - 2023) and I was thinking of this song
13	Alaa	Full of broken thoughts
14	Алексей Потапов	это просто - ШЕДЕВР!!!
15	Artyom Tsaryov	Вообще чётко
16	Winterwolf	Currently losing my brother now.. I understand you Johnny... I understand it so well..
17	Gaurdian Tome	Because you all killed son.
18	DAPICS	I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way
19	Chinmay mandal	Wao… those few words by Trent Renzor… ❤❤
20	Not so hunkey Monkey	This is the closest a song will come to making me cry and it was damn close
21	OscarDev	I will never forgive him for being impatient on that pause between the verses and chorus where Trent sets the tone, but here he just jumps it.
22	Not Sure	Oh man, I am more scared to grow old and suffer than of dying :(
23	William Kennedy	I think Trent Reznor produced this. Powerful Try Gods gonna cut you down. Also powerful
24	Steven Wolf	9 inch nails
25	Steve Blundon	"The year is 2002. A guitar student comes in for his lesson and asks, ""Have you heard Johnny Cash's version of Hurt yet?"". I quickly find a copy, cue it up and sit in my teacher's chair - just - listening. Replaying it three times because I can't believe what I'm hearing. I've never, ever heard anyone sledgehammer their stake in the ground with such musical perfection. Johnny absolutely OWNED this song in every way. To this day, his version still has the same effect on me, and probably you as well."
26	Quim Buth	The real Truth of life
27	Huize Vulto	i cannot imagine the emotions this song conjured. a true legend signign off. gone, but NEVER forgotten.
28	Shelby	what hae i become my sweetest frend
29	russ morrow	Legendary performance
30	Rick Salisbury	A 20 year old Trent Resnor ,(NINE INCH NAILS) wrote this song. Trent says Johnny owns the song.
31	Martin Smith	The most poigont film I ha e ever seen.
32	Todd A	I found Pretty Hate Machine in November of 1989 after jogging to a record store in Lake Tahoe...been a Trent Reznor/NIN fan ever since. Absolutely beautiful, monster of a cover. How the fuck did I miss this?
33	Orcastro Júnior	Listen, this song can also be great: https://youtu.be/Tt-ABLG4KC0
34	Orcastro Júnior	Waw. What a song
35	Iskander Utyashev	It's been officially 20 years since Johnny Cash has died and this song is still here to keep his legacy alive!
36	Connor Prince	He lowkey looks like he could be godfather
37	Cristián Gonzalez	So very deep
38	Colin Tomlinson	I am the youngest of seven children I dearly hope that I don't have to say goodbye to my six lovely sisters

46	Deep Learning	The Gods a God
47	tRex	You can't do it much better than that. Song and video.
48	Gary Robinson	A fitting last song for a truly american original
49	Jamie Soden	❤️
50	Art Fleck	I can't stop playing this and I can't stop crying.
51	Sean Atherton-Feeney	The greatest compliment to a song writer is to have their song covered so well its authorship is lost and the global community forgets you wrote it. In that forgetting can be found, ironically, immortality. Thanks Trent and Cash.
52	Dan R Goodnight	incredibly powerful and still causes a problem with my allergies
53	helmut23456	This song touches my soul.... Johnny's greatest work; he saved it for last~~~~
54	Dan Gennaro	You know, I was never a big fan of Johnny cash, never was a country fan at all, I said his music was too dark or sad, or depressing as a teen and young adult. Then you get older and life happens, where you find yourself in a dark pit, when everything is upside down, wrecked, and all of a sudden his music resonates so much more in my soul. Especially this song above all else. What a amazing anthem.
55	Mike Freitag	I can’t even listen to it. 😢
56	David Cox	Cash's version of this song still makes the hairs on my arm stand up. 25 years ago, if someone suggested Johnny Cash was going to cover a Nine Inch Nails song, I would have said that's a stupid and even ridiculous idea. But my God, this song is at another level. So emotional it rips you apart.
57	Matz Hatz	poor rich man😭
58	LazyDemonSeed	LEGEND
59	grezy_mechta	Awwww am so emothionnel.😱😱😱😱 am litteraly crying😱😱the piano is good😱😱 Fck off cringy ppl w ur shit music taste

61	Peter Nicklin	Every one I know goes away in the end. Mom and dad I miss you.
62	Cesar Elias	one of the most honest pieces of music ever created
63	Autism Social Cast	Time forces the memory in its place. Instant gratification is only for the Cool Cats. Let me explain. Memory makes you want to go back to that feeling. Addiction, a terrible thing that the elite neurotypicals. Resistant to peer pressure unless it for its own petty gain, then force must be used, because natural selection never ends well for the monster. You will never take down the ringleader, you can persuade those around them to pull the trigger.
64	DrMattDestruction	they lied to you about the minimum wage. if the minimum wage was $0/hour, you could've been hiring employees since you were 14. everyone can afford to work for $0/hour if the Universal Basic Income is in place. let's give everyone a guaranteed minimum income of $1,500ish USD/month. tretettetet
65	christianlorre	It's so chilling. And so sad seeing how much he aged so badly. Brings out a lot lot of pain because I remember my mother and how much she changed in the last 25 years of her life going downhill so subtle until you realize how much is lost far too late.
66	Bradley Carrico	I really wanna know how this song came to be chose. So different from the normal Johnny Cash songs. What a cover! It’s no longer a 9 inch nails tune.
67	Lemar Tin	What have I become- my Swedish friend?
68	Dimka86	👍🇺🇦

72	Mark Cargill	Thank you JC for everything. Love from Scotland.
73	Tobias Kuhn	I loose it everytime June shows up and I can't stop bawling my eyes out
74	Clint Potts	I grew up listening to my dad listening to Johnny Cash. He had all the early albums and when he got in a particular mood, the Johnny Walker and the Johnny Cash came out. He'd sit in the dark listening to all of the old songs. When the music stopped and the lights went on, dad was himself again. Sometimes, you just need to feel some pain. I always respected Cash but it was this song that made me understand. This song made me a fan. Sometimes, you just need to Hurt.
75	Whitevaliantwarrior	🎼 It doesn't matter who you are...Great, small or tiny, burnt out with nothing to your name. No matter what you have attained or all the money, fame and riches to your name. Because in the end you take nothing with you. All will stand before their Maker, Creator of all mankind, The highest, most mighty of any & everything. ( 2 Corinthians 5:10 ) For we must all appear before the judgment seat of CHRIST, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. ( Romans 14:12 ) So then each one of us will give an account of himself to GOD. ( Hebrews 9:27 ) And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment 🙏 🙌 .

79	iam_henriettajonas	After a bad breakup. I remember crying to this song in the shower
80	Delia Art	I remember fondly riding shot gun in ol' Nelly Bell my dad's second generation f series.. radio turned up with Jonny Cash. I always say with pride to this day that I grew up with the best music ever. I wish country music was the same. Oh the good times good days. One day I'm gonna buy me a truck just like my dads travel to whever the road takes me and blast Jonny Cash on the radio..
81	Miss Deadite	parts of this song both the NiN version and his cover are basically the relationship I have in my head with my mental illnesses. At some point I make a new mistake and they feed off of each other over and over. Never ending pain for days or weeks. I get to a point where I shut down. The pain numbs and I can function again until the next mistake and it begins again.
82	Sheenia S.A.R.G	This song makes u cry...I haft to say this is the sadest song Johnny Cash has ever sung its sad to see him and June gone They was the best country singers they will be missed..
83	Bastian Guerrero	One of the strongest voices ever been heared and it will still in the futre without doubt
84	Isac Arnold	'What have I become' a fucking legend. Even though you pasted before I was even born, we all still miss, love and respect the man in black

95	Neil Jessop	What a great song, very moving 😢
96	IAmManWithTheGun	He died just one year after performing this cover…
97	Dionusia Kiata	❤❤💩💩☘️
98	Koheleth	I know he did A LOT of dope, but I just don't think that accounts for how poorly he aged. People of his generation surely aged poorly. I mean the man only live to be 71, would've been about 70 when he filmed this, but looked and seemed every bit of 90. Today 70-year-olds certainly don't look young, but they didn't age that badly in comparison. And today you'll find many people in their 60s who look pretty damned good. And I'm talking rock stars who partied hard like Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, Tommy Shaw, etc. There's a quite a few who have aged really well. But people do seem to age better, not everyone, but in general. I mean, that's why you have Tom Brady playing in the NFL at 45 and other athletes--fighters even--competing professionally into their 40s. I remember when Joe Montana seemed like an old man when he went to Kansas City in his 30s. Lot of genetic luck involved for sure, but it's important to take care yourself too, but it's amazing that even those who don't still seem to age better than the generations before them. Probably a lot of stuff in environment is better today, no lead in the paint or gasoline anymore, probably lots of reasons for it.

106	Sheldon	Miss this legend more today then yesterday. RIP Johnny, never forgotten🙏
107	JxrZ	Not only does this hit hard, you can feel the pain in Johnny Cash’s voice. All the things he probably wishes he done differently, just like any human on the planet. We all have regrets. It’s sad world we live in and no matter how hard we try, we still have them. I told myself I wasn’t gonna do drugs when I seen D.A.R.E, but that was a lie. I’m clean now, but I did listen to this when I was high. You’ll never understand the word hate until you’ve hated yourself

140	Dylan H	"""If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way"" Regret at a young age is one thing as there is a whole life ahead of you that has yet to be defined. The end is very different."
141	Elysha Ray	The fact that Johnny Cash did a cover of Trent Reznors song is amazing and to hear how humble Trent was about it, bewildered is amazing in itself.
142	Heckensteiner	John F. Kennedy, Johnathan Taylor Thomas, Johnny Cash.
143	David Thorton	They say there are songs floating in air just need to reach out and grab them, it also says that everyone has a song in themselves. This song was playing in the Heart of millions over the life of mankind, every one heard this song playing in there head, Trent Reznor was the first to bring it out to the world, Johnny Cash put the final touch on it,

147	The Archangel Michael I Am #17	16“Come near me and listen to this: “From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; at the time it happens, I am there.” And now the Sovereign Lord has sent me, endowed with his Spirit. 17This is what the Lord says— your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go. 18If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your well-being like the waves of the sea. 19Your descendants would have been like the sand, your children like its numberless grains; their name would never be blotted out nor destroyed from before me.” 20Leave Babylon, flee from the Babylonians! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth; say, “The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob.” 21They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and water gushed out. 22“There is no peace,” says the Lord, “for the wicked.” Q-link 17/45

Rest In Peace Grandfather Leslie; the world is a darker place now, without you in it. Miss you so much Grandpa. Fly High and wait for me

160	Ben Wood	I was 17 when I went to a Nine inch nails concert, he played this song. It was incredible. I thought it could never be topped. Then Johnny Fuckin Cash did it, and realize it was always his song.

165	Woobyca	Trent Reznor said after seeing Johnny's video that the song was no longer his. I wonder if Reznor wrote this song for Johnny and never knew it...God works in mysterious ways.
166	Marie de Roubaix	Magnifique, émouvant.❤😍🇫🇷🎈🇪🇺
167	Andrea Padilla	It still blows my mind that he didn't write this song, it was written by Nine Inch Nails!
168	Totally Not E	Not the biggest fan of his, but this song hits hard. Like the part I relate to is feeling like I’ll let people down and hurt them without trying. It’s the reason I have a hard letting people come close to see the mess that is underneath who I actually am.

175	David A. Gorton	"Not sure old age is survivable and livable in any meaningful way w/o Jesus. Being old and bitter is torturous, full of recrimination. Statistics for elderly suicides are 2nd in nation behind veterans. Johnny knew Jesus in early life, that early introduction to faith all but disappeared in his wild years, but allowed him to be forgiven his failures in his last years. ""I will never leave you or forsake!"" Christ Jesus"
176	Kimberly Richard	Wow! Just wow!!

178	Patriot 1974	Johnny Cash just like Nikki six both had shit fathers that sent them on the road to Self destruction thank God they found God an gave us so many years of great music
179	Phil Richards	This is another great cover
180	Phil Richards	He was your grandmother's favorite
181	Renaider	"Until you (we) die , everyone goes before you. Then you leave someone when it's your turn. It's a dirty trick this life thing plays on us because if you are privileged enough to live a long life , you are also cursed enough to lose more loved ones. The best we can hope for is to enjoy them while they're here and honor their memories when they are gone. It's not all so morbid though. Life is a gift and , like everything it comes at a cost. ""I would rather have loved and lost than never loved at all"" is one of my favorite sayings. Enjoy the now."

222	Roberto Schneider	I come back to this song every time I am sad and suffering (like now) and it’s a guaranteed cry
223	Warren Wilson Batista	I'm a 49 year ol man filled with sadness, anger, loneliness and regret. I never had a meaningful life here on earth. If I could start again, I would fine a way
224	Jean Michel MARTIN	Understand this song is undertand life...
225	Vicki Gonzales	Feel this and we all wish we could go back to change the things we did and now regret!.
226	No time like today	This song is so sad, for such a strong man he was holding on to a lot of pain
227	Henrik Kragh	Man... 71 years old here, looks 100. What a great song.
228	vhs1994	I'm glad he's not here to see all the bs going on in the states. Rest Easy Brother.
229	Philip Cucci	I didn’t know he was still alive when I first saw this video. Turns out I was too late to meet him.
230	Ricardo Barría	Una hermosa Canción...
231	The Animation Kingdom	What a legend! everytime I get goosebumps listening to this masterpiece.
232	Recovering Catholic Born Again Atheist 	No other song touches every emotion like this........ pain is hard to talk about, but we all feel it.............
233	Chris Flagg	this was one of if not the first song i wanted to learn how to play. it is simple in its notes but powerful in its message

238	Mystical Wise Tree🌳	Henry Dean
239	Ben Leermakers	The more i listen to this, the harder it kicks in.... Great song, deep emotions.
240	River Critter	Tool completely stole a Led Zepplin song. Ryan Upchurch completely stole a T Grizzly song. This is every bit as good, if not better, than the remake he did of the Soundgarden song Rusty Cage. Johnny Cash is dead but because of what all he left for us, he'll never die
241	Games and more inc	Latino Heat
242	Space Elf Downlink	I have never seen the video before, heard it plenty. but now I know why Trent basically said its no longer his song.
243	Praise Nation Kids	This song and video are...it's just not fair...ruthless to the emotions.
244	Arnold Blashak	This is all about June Carter
245	Wes Baumguardner	Perhaps I am biased, but I prefer the original. Cash is so monotoned and almost expressionless throughout the entire song that it sounds almost robotic to me. Perhaps people take this monotone expressionless voice as a man coming to grips with his mortality in casual acceptance, which I understand, but I still do not think that makes it as exceptionally great of a performance as many people do.
246	Justin Young	Check out the ishayas ascension for a better life.
247	Christie reactions	This great music video almost made me cry😅
248	Ellie Saafi	What a gorgeous rendition.
249	Victoria Stroup	In his song hurt
250	Victoria Stroup	There are some things he sings in his song that I can relate to that's why I was asking
251	Victoria Stroup	May I ask what the name of Johnny Cash's movies called
252	Krogan Love	Welcome to the human condition buddy. DId you think the misery pain suffering and guilt that you read about in books and saw in movies wasn't real?

261	Sascha Ross	This song Was part of my Personal darkest hour. I had nobody to talk to or Listen to. I suffererd under my severe depression. And then i heard that Song and started to turn my life around. 6 years later i hear this, cry and take up my guitar
262	MrKaywyn	Remarkable.
263	Razgy Mic	It's been officially 20 years since Johnny Cash has died and this song is still here to keep his legacy alive !
264	Jonas Elmore	The best of music new forever!
265	BardiX Official	Trent Reznor and Johnny Cash tell 2 different stories, Trent Reznor is in crisis and is soul searching, wherein Johnny is running out of time, at the end, both can make everyone shed a tear
266	EF3CD	damn, this song hits like a truck
267	GingerNorseman	this man is my world
268	William Taylor	The world needs a bit more of Johnny Cash.
269	Jão	.
270	Sharon Noble	He as we all ...have to walk through this life. The human condition is so very broken. He found the answer to a broken humanity. He found his Savior and his Redeemer. He left us who remain with the hope of eternal salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord! Don't miss what he tried to impart to us. Johnny Cash lived it. He absolutely knew of what he spoke!
271	Jesse Bronson	"Wow is all i have to say.... what a beutiful spirit, i would't find a way"". :.( ""try to kill it all always"" always makes me emotional but all that understand."" understand. No matter what remember that you are important and there is a reason...."
272	Giao	God bless Johnny Cash. 😢❤
273	keza41	Bloody dusty in here…
274	Massimiliano Mallegni	......
275	J. Clayton	Johnny Cash had a pretty good run. This song doesn't ring true of him at the end of his life. He would have felt his best life was yet to come. This is moving anyway.
276	Dan's Hunting for Collectibles.	He is so missed
277	Pestcontrol	I love that Trent said this is no longer his song he gave it to the man in black
278	Gavin C	This song hits even after all these years
279	Lawrence Begg	This song hit home because I was up last month a life long drug addict
280	Ashley Banks	My boyfriend Joker Pugh made me listen to this. He's just 23 & I'm 22. I still wonder why he listens to such at his age. Not my type of song but I think it has lots to say about how he feels inside him. I hope to love him better ❤
281	Andre Kozonoff	ANDREAS HERBERT BARTHOL CLEVELAND OHIO LIL HERB ON DA CURB CLEVELAND OHIO ANDREAS LOVES YOU ❤️❤️❤️❤️
282	Cookie Banana	I’m back this time because my cousin committed suicide and this song helps comfort me during the pain
283	wind amnesy	Great song, great men. Thank you.
284	anywaythewindblows89	“Everyone I know goes away in the end.” Oh my God, so true.
285	Slightly Damaged	This makes me cry every time. Cash really made hurt his, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
286	Gone Full Trad	Whenever I am thinking that I lack emotion or like I have just shut myself off to the world with a coldness towards suffering or pain I remind myself to watch this video and it comforts me in knowing that I m still here and that I do actually feel emotions . I watch people wither and die for a living (cancer center) and its songs like this that keeps me connected to humanity and life.
287	Cali72	speechless😪
288	Boardwalk BW	Ouch, this gets me feeling that painful lump in my throat every time...Love Johnny and June
289	mick g'ee	Quite possibly the most beautiful rendition of any song ever with such a beautiful story to go with it , this will 100% at my funeral
290	Jeremy Braunm	I'm a Johnny Cash and I absolutely love this song

292	Joziu	2023
293	MissPristineVenom	Tears...
294	Not Sure	Although not Johnny's song, it HAS become HIS song. Johnny's transparency about his addictions. Yet, he had hope the the Lord Jesus for forgiveness.
295	Lex Hoogvliet	Respect RIP
296	BILLY THE SUPE-BUTCHER	Sometimes some lyrics reminds your past mistakes and your gorgeous childhood
297	Mark Brown	I hope he was reconciled to the Creator. Amazing voice Johnny had. I first heard him in the late 60's on my dad's stereogram. Still sounds amazing in 2023.

310	ZER0	It's a song written by one person but owned by another, Trent said as much. Like Sinéad O'Connor owned Prince's song.... Where she cried a lot.
311	ROSS EDWARDS	Very similar to my vibe! Please check my latest country song, 'Im sure y'all like it too :) Thanks Ross https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FFVfIQXAoo
312	Mr. Bogs	"Someone please tell me I'm not crazy. I remember seeing this exact video many years ago. Then a few ago, when it was ""remastered"" or reuploaded to YouTube in HD format, the clips of Jesus were removed. I thought I was insane, until I had found a low quality upload on some random website. I compared the two and noted that the one on YouTube was in fact different than the original. Now, I pull up the video on YouTube and Jesus is in it again. Has anyone else recognized this?!"

322	tlc1145	The greatest cover of all times. I'm glad he lived long enough to make this amazing song.
323	Eternally Thankful 3771	This video of Cash doing Trent's song is just THE most emotional I've ever gotten over a music vid - it gets me EVERY SINGLE time I watch it. I in ZERO way want to detract from the song , but I didn't like it when NIN did it...just couldn't relate so it didn't reach me...ZERO hate or disrespect...it just didn't move me because of where I was at at that time. Then I watched a video interview about Cash wanting to do the song and Trent's ok with doing so...watched the video and I was floored....truly , whole-heartedly emotional...WOW !! The video and it's message speaks for itself and needs NO explanation from me as to why it is SO powerful. The ADDED power comes from my realization that Trent , not only by giving his permission to cover the song , but the arrival of Trent himself at a place where he can acknowledge another artist's greatness with the piece AND be completely happy with letting go of the song for Johnny's legacy - it just so much about how much Trent has grown as a human being and a man - I hope he realizes the beauty , growth and accomplishment of himself in this journey. Much respect to both artists , the video director and all who made this loving achievement possible.
324	LeeLee Me	Her face. Knowing this would be his last video. Knowing first hand what he had and lost to age and time. That blink said it all. You youngsters need to remember - where we go, you too will follow. Be kind to your elders. Learn lessons from them. One day it will be you counting down the last days.

339	FERNANDO CONTRERAS DEL ANGEL	Gracias johnny cash por está canción ❤

356	BixLives32	"Johnny and June, June and Johnny. A matched set of two unique, individuals. Each had their own song writing style, quite different from each other. June probably wrote significantly more songs than Johnny. I have not heard a song written by either of them that I did not like, ...A LOT. I have not compared their publishing catalogues, but I am fairly sure that June's songwriting was more prolific. Johnny's great talent seemed to be his impeccable taste, and ability to find superior songs. Johnny Cash was able to uniquely interpret and perform a song so that the song would forever be identified with Cash. Despite this daunting ability, other performers continue to cover Johnny's interpretations of songs written by others. (I haven't that much courage). When Johnny Cash performed a song it was his forever. One oddity in Cash's career is ""The Folsom Prison Blues"". Even today, Johnny is listed as the song's writer. Nope. The song was written by Gordon Jenkins as the ""The Second Dream - The Conductor"" on the seminal, thematic album, ""Seven Dreams"" (1954) by Gordon Jenkins on Decca. I mention this because this was THE first microgroove, long playing record to boast a contiguous theme without the usual banding between cuts (like the Beatles, Sgt Peppers). Seven Dreams was a milestone and I recommend this record , —if you can find a copy! It was released on CD, but the tapes were old and the digital master done poorly. I have a clean copy of the original Decca (""Unbreakable"") record, and have faithfully remastered it using professional gear. I wish I could give you all a copy. It remains an important record and quite enjoyable. I suspect that Johnny wrote his version of ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" shortly prior to the concert. That Cash used Gordon Jenkins music and lyrics as a vehicle for ""The Folsom Prison Blues"" was likely NOT a conscious act of plagiarism. I suspect that Johnny believed that he desperately needed new material that would relate to the prisoners and show them that he was NOT influenced by the prison authorities. Johnny simply substituted a few words to the Gordon Jenkins song, thus, forever branding the song his own. It's not important who wrote the song, but that Johnny had the taste and sense to make the song his own and appropriate for his unusual and dangerous audience. The inmate audience did NOT riot. There was even some mixing of black and white prisoners (unthinkable at that time). To a man, the inmates were well behaved and had a great time. Plus, Johnny was able to make the concert part of his personal moral statement that he felt was central to his life. Only Johnny Cash could have bought off this great performance. Any person, abused, tread upon, or who feels themselves injured, will find HEALING in Johnny and June's work. Oddly, many people thought Johnny had served prison time (not true); —probably confusing Johnny with Merle Haggard, as well as a couple of minor arrests Johnny suffered in two small southern towns while he was touring. They were errors of police judgement and Johnny was released in the morning. When touring back then, particularly in The South, most artists knew to stay close to the hotel (or private home, if they were a black artist). Jim Crow ruled for many years. If the prison officials had known about the song, I am sure they would have insisted that Cash NOT play the song. No joke, EVERYONE was scared out of their wits, prior to the concert. I am sure Johnny did not intentionally lift the song, plus, the original song was a 1 - 4 - 5 based blues. The Gordon Jenkins record was obviously an important work and heard by many people in the industry. Johnny would surely have heard the original. I have heard that Johnny financially settled with Decca and Gordon Jenkins as soon as he was informed of the plagiarism. The Folsom Prison concert was , perhaps, the bravest act of any performing artist in history. Columbia Records desperately tried to thwart the project, but Cash was intent. As he was selling a LOT of records, Johnny was able (barely) to make it all happen. The Folsom Warden and other CA State prison officials were also against the project. All the ""experts"" were predicting a riot. The movie did not show nearly the anxiety over the project. Moreover, Johnny and June were scared beyond any other concert they had performed. How Johnny and June manage to make the Folsom project happen is beyond me. If you like this music, have a listen to June's last few records, particularly, ""Press On"". The entire album works as a whole and could easily be labelled a masterpiece. ""Gatsby's Restaurant"", ""Tiffany Anastasia Lowe"" and ""I Used To Be Somebody"" are songs that I found unusually affecting and entertaining. Norman Blake's work is wonderful; —simple and pure soul. Marty Stuart is also on the record and plays as you would expect; —perfect. The album sounds like people in a living room playing and having a nice evening. There is great humour, however, there are also points at which you might find yourself crying..."
357	Steffen Würtz	Cool
358	Deborah Garcia	never never never ever as u would say...never again. it was like attempted murder to me. im dead to you now and i will never be resurrected....good luck???? i think not unless good luck is what i salvaged from a relationship gone SERIOUSLY WRONG. ONE THAT I WAS MORE THAN A FOOL TO PURSUE. ..PEOPLE ARE NOT DISPOSABLE...AT LEAST IM NOT.
359	Deborah Garcia	one day u will listen to this tom and u will remember......goodbye forever
360	ivanyurkinov	the regrets and pain felt here is directly from the loss of his partner, and best friend. when she passed away it was more then he could carry. the man died of a broken heart and would have given every thing he owned to have her back .
361	Big ‘n	Once the piano starts hitting them chords I just start sobbing 😂
362	Jonathan Jollimore	You can tell when someone pours there hart in something and it show Johnny knew his time was coming to an end and Trent's lyrics are pure hart
363	Jdog5755	IMO losing Jonny cash was the biggest tragedy that has befallen the human race.
364	AyBee	Very tasteful and sensible version of this song. I wish more older artists would follow that minimalistic kind of sound. That`s by far more intense and interesting.
365	Ken Meadows	This will be played at my funeral
366	Death2Weebs	You gotta get with the times
367	PC Classic Golf	Talk about an old man making a young man feel like he accomplished something major in his life! Johnny brought depth and emotion to this song which is most likely going to be known as his Swan Song. Forever JC! 🎶

371	Patrick O'Neal	I remember when this was played regularly on CMT in 2003. Clearly this video was shot before the passing of his wife, June Carter. I think this is one of the most powerful music videos ever made in ANY genre of music. I certainly think “Hurt” has become his requiem.
372	Carl grahan Gahan	He truly was is the cash the man was is good for all
373	Hurricane Floyd	This song is a bookend to life, Trent Reznor on one end and Johnny Cash on the other. Powerful in two different ways.

389	Soulbear42	Alas it did not happen but if it was needed oooo mama would it of ever been Mister Cash's song.

397	Marvylene Regahal	I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

407	Robert Felsing	This isn’t just a song, it’s a moment in time that cannot be repeated. Only Johnny Cash could have sung this song the way he did, and he could only sing it the way he did after a lifetime of being Johnny Cash. God bless Trent Reznor for giving him the platform to do so.
408	soares9	Yunk Vino🖤
409	Gerry Bozarth	Considering that Trent Reznor didn't write this song specifically for Johnny it sure fit his life story.

416	Michael Mannucci	The comment section is full of NIN fans who desperately need to let everyone know Cash didn’t write it. Like, ok, we get it! I mean, I think this cover shows that there’s more to a good song than good lyrics. The original isn’t a very good song. Cash took the good lyrics and general structure and made a good song. *ducks from all the angry NIN fans*
417	mkrool	honestly one of the best covers of a nin song ever but i still prefer the original
418	Stan99reborn	Remember when this song wasn’t here at all on YouTube

435	ZAJ	I remember my mom being a fan of Cash. Lately I have been thinking about her again. Because despite the fact she walked out of my life with no regard for the family she was tearing apart, and how much I hate that she did that to me... I still loved her. And I've found myself tearing up sometimes when I listen to this song because, it's such a profound expression of regret and yearning. Often I've found myself struggling with the hole left inside of me because of my mom. It's led me down an unstable road due to how that deep loss struck my mental health. My mom might be someone else now. But I'm still here, right now, and I want to become something better despite how I lost her. I truly want to be someone better than what losing her the way I did had made me into. I end up drawn to this song, because I've done a lot of things to make people hurt, done things that I deeply regret, and I always yearn to start anew somehow. I want to find a way, like that closing lyric. It's strange how a song by an artist that my estranged mother loved, has still found such a deep comforting connection to me. It's simply reassuring, humbling, and profound.

So if you relate to this song because of sadness, despair, loneliness, hopelessness, regrets, addictions, failures, pain, relationship failures or any other dark emotion or experience.... please hear me... The God that Johnny knew and served loves you. He makes all things new. He even gives new hearts to those who turn to Him. He says to forget the past and look forward to an eternal future with Him in paradise. So please my friend - turn to Him.

499	Casey Hemming	Cash owns this Reznor song now. I had tears in my eyes the 1st time I watched this at film school. Johnny's like an ice cream melting in the sun, fastly approaching the end of his life. His voice is emotional pain personified. One of the greatest songs I've ever heard. Simple, but incredibly powerful.... WOW.

My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

513	Jhonalter José de Campos	(🇧🇷) I can't believe he passed away in 2003 a few months after his wife passed away. Is this song about regret? Is it a song of bitterness? Is it recognition? It's a message that he was it making everything transparent? It got to me. I can't believe it will be 20 years since his death!!! Não acredito que ele faleceu em 2003, alguns meses depois que sua esposa faleceu. Essa música é sobre arrependimento? É uma canção de amargura? É reconhecimento? É uma mensagem que estava deixando tudo em pratos limpos? Isso me pegou! Nem acredito que já se passaram 20 anos desde a morte dele!!!

I was a part of a community theater that did a program called ""Little Ole Opry""... So wjen our director heard Johnny Cash was doing a show, she got all us Opry dancers down there. The house was packed, for an impromptu! Small town.. News go quick! So we're in the front row and he sees us girls all gussied up in our Opry dance dresses and calls us up! We only danced to old bluegrass songs like Foggy Mountain Breakdown and such... But the band only knew The Devil Went Down to Georgia... So we got up and danced to that 😁💕 Johnny and June were so gracious and lovely. He even signed my dance shoe after we performed. Most memorable experience in my life... Besides giving birth to my 2 beautiful children and also meeting Mikhail Barishyshikov.. And he signed my ballet shoes too! But anyways, I love Johnny Cash cuz he was so humble and sweet and just a good good man. 💛🙏 RIP"

559	JB Wood	A hauntingly beautiful masterpiece. Mr Cash seems to be bearing his soul. It gives me chills whenever I hear it. It is timeless...
560	Βασίλης Ξενικάκης	Perhaps the greatest cover of a song ever, right next to All Along the Watchtower and Knocking on Heavens Door. The impact that the time period of Cash's life has in the cover is so massive. I've never heard a song that takes a bigger and harder hit each time I listen to it, as my time in this world passes. Truly amazing.
561	Roller Girl	Trent should see this song as flattery. Yes Johnny out did him and made it HIS song but for good reason. He was the OG. And as much as Trent has suffered in his life Johnny suffered more if only through age and experience. You can just feel the loss of his brother, growing up literally dirt poor, decades of drug addiction heartbreak and loss and more then anything? REGRET. He just wants to go back and start his life over when he’s so close to death. This would have been a good song for Elvis to cover too but he died a decade before it was written. It’s impossible to watch this without crying 💔😞 At least Johnny had his wife

But as I got older, I realize my views on the song start to change. And I know 5 years Woah no biggie but 5 years can change a person. As i got older, I realized it was a change of perspective. It's simply just weird...

598	Benzoxxcrystlexoxo	Fuck man this song will always remind me of my grandpa he is still alive but quickly deteriorating and it’s sad to see him slowly rot from Parkinson’s he loved Johnny cash and loved to sing his songs actually he was even born the same year as Johnny man this pain is not pleasant even being born in gen z (2005) I can still appreciate old music from legends like this

608	Todd Branston	Thanks much to Mr. Cash - this song serves as a reminder that I've come a long way. I no longer need to stick a needle in my arm. More than 42 years sober and I'm so grateful to the opportunity given to me by my grandparents.
609	zachman893	i infinitely like this version of hurt the best. so much emotion in johnnys tone, like hes reliving his past with every word.
610	Peter von Feldt	R.I.P music legend. His music and my memories of his music still live on better than the crap movie documentary ever will.
611	Sheldon C Edward Thibault	Johnny was probably 70 at the time of the making of this video, he passed away at 71 in 2003! In this video Cash looks way older than 70, he looks like he's 85!
612	Alex Pazmino	The man myth the legend.
613	Kev Hill	This song by the 9inch nails was a great song already. But JC took it to new heights. A great song ending for an amazing man.
614	Brett Yon	I'm sitting here, smoking a cigarette and dreading going to work. Just listening to Johnny Cash and drinking coffee. Off to another new year, greeting it with blunt steel.
615	Byron Marmol	I just googled it and Johnny Cash had a stellium in piscis, with the ascendant there and a Mercury in joy but in Fall/Detriment there in the 1st house, with the moon in Scorpio and Saturn in Rulership in the 12th house :( imagine feeling feelings that way!

622	Manignis	For that, my pain is of me, of my body because it belong to me.
623	J D	If I could do it all over again.I would start by being a better person.Because in this life I was not a good man.I lied.I hurt people.And with time all the people I loved and hurt ,died away.I would give my entire fortune to do it all over again.This time,I'd do it right.I would be a good person.I'd make it work. To me Mr. Cash was repenting all of his sins.To whom ever he may have hurt. And most of all to his maker.This song came along right as he was to die and it was a given that he sung it.
624	JWM	the goose bumps never stop
625	Samuel.J.Barker	"It's sad to me how so many have heard this, but not fully acknowledged the message. Johnny Cash lived a long life full of success and material wealth, in fact his life was overrun with the necessity to maintain his empire. At the time of the recording of Hurt, when Cash was 71, he'd realised the superficiality of it all. He'd reached the end of the line, looked back at his empire and saw it was nothing but dirt. What was worse is the fact, the higher the heights you reach, the harder it is you'll fall. Age is not kind to anyone, but someone dependent on image far less. If he could, he would trade it all to start again and keep HIMSELF. Fame and money won't embrace you when you're dying, neither will memories of roaring crowds or moments of success. The only thing that will embrace you when you're on your way out, is the loved ones you've made in your life. A life of fame and wealth is a life that makes this a very hard thing to achieve. Yet nowadays it's more aspired to than it ever has been before. Cash learned the hard way, he was trying to warn you. ""Keep to yourself"" I won't reach the end of the line having chased fame to the top and roil under the pressure of the fall"
626	Undertaker67203	This song still fills me with strong emotions barely under control. Never has two versions of one song conveyed such strong but differing views. Trent was young barely keeping it together. Johnny was at the end, seeing his life in the rear view and knowing not much time lay ahead. Both versions are so powerful.
627	furious warfare	continue comme ca c parfait ils faut plus de personne comme toi
628	Izzy Meadows	Rip you legend of a man. This is the version of this song. Fact
629	jennifer taylor	I remember when I first saw this amazing video, it was newly released on MTV and I got up after, amazed, but sad.. thinking wow.. he doesn’t look so good. Thinking, with June gone, I’m sure he wanted to be with her. Went to the bedroom and came out to hearing it announced that Johnny Cash had passed away.. I was dumbstruck…devastated and deeply saddened such an icon that I’ve “known” since I was a small child was gone.

636	craig mcmillan	Smack destroyed his internal feelings it does it to everyone
637	craig mcmillan	John was a very troubled man
638	RAP 4Live	Every time I hear this song I get tears in m eyes...
639	MaddawgMar MMA Takes	The fact that Reznor was young when he wrote this and recorded it was sad that he faced all that at such a young age. But for Cash to record it at the end of his life made it that much more sad, as there was no time to change it. It added a depth of sadness to an already sad song. Both artists are geniuses
640	𝔅𝔬𝔲𝔩𝔞𝔫𝔤𝔢𝔯	anyone in 1989?
641	tulio barbosa	❤❤ que música 🍷🗿
642	Winston Wegner	This cover will forever be one for the boys. If only they understood the weight we carry. Love you guys, stay steady!

645	Isaiah Trevino	Who’s listening in 2023?
646	Mary Kipp	My goodness……have a life that relates to this song even though I have no needle fame.
647	Christopher Sabados	I’m not a say fan of him but I would say this is top 3 songs ever it’s so honest and real.
648	Noah	This is one of the few covers that I've seen surpass the original

656	Talon David	difficult to believe this guy was a pill head
657	Isaiah Voss	"20 years this year it would've been since you've been gone Johnny. This is your swan song. This is every man's song of regret from their past but has a beautiful ending ahead for the future. You knew it was your time to go but you've done it beautifully. The final lyrics ""If I could start again, a million miles away. I would keep myself, I would find a way"" describes how a career and the man you were. This piece of music describes who you were. Closing the piano at the end is a casket closed. We all miss you Johnny."
658	James Wilson	At 67 years old and having lost both my parents, father in law, and my best friend I find myself reflecting back more and more these days. I can feel his pain when he sings! Maybe we should all try to be a little more kind to those we love, life is much too short!
659	HumanCapybaras	Life sucks anyways
660	Bogdan Kenon	I understand the meaning but i feel i can relate at 23 and it s me now and my good side… my friend
661	BuBaClD	I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way
662	Shane Vang	good job

671	M e i a	Perfect Swan song from someone from the hollywood industry for too long.
672	vivien o	I was convinced this was a modern record and music video. I realized after googling it, that it dates back from 2002. Damn. Impossible to tell it's 20 years, the production style wouldn't have changed a bit if it was made now.
673	RealLifeMaster	"Sodi Al-Fayet one ""Flüchtling"", seines Vater's Muhammad Schüler Adolf ein SingStar...???"
674	Gerry James	Just goes to show….Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes at the end of his life, as an appeal to successive generations, to learn before it’s too late. We see our own suffering and despair now (through Trent), and see through Johnny that it doesn’t end with experience, and through Solomon that only God can interrupt that downhill slide. Old or young, we all suffer through this life.
675	Саня	👌👍
676	ª	when im old, i'll sing this.
677	Mark Ingham	Everyone says this is the greatest cover, I don't believe that, it's truly in a class of its own. No matter how many times you hear this song it always hits the heart the most.
678	Ryan Anderson	After going through family drama and where I am at in life, this song rings a bell. It really tells you that life is not an easy thing to overcome! Don't look for the end, enjoy what you have right now! <3
679	Ochoa Tv	We will all feel whay he is feeling
680	Bliss	This video is masterpiece, as well as the song. So much emotions in it...
681	Hungry Boy	Just fantastic.
682	Timothy Norman	This song speaks to your soul, beautiful and harrowing at the same time.
683	Shane Grahovac	This is perhaps the greatest video and song performance Ives ever seen. This blew me away when it first appeared on MTV many years ago and still remains the same today.
684	Назар Беницкий	З новим роком привіт з України дякую за вашу музику
685	Farhan shahriar	I guess this is how we all end
686	anthony simpson	I remember listening to Johnny cash as a kid with my grandad, it was such a great time, i would sit in his chair with him, I’d listen to this song and imagine what it would be like if he was gone, now he is, and it hurts like hell
687	nathanmielke	"The imagery of the last super and the pouring out of the cup and Johnny singing ""my empire of dirt"" and the hard cut to Christ on the cross.... all with the piano ringing on that same note. It shakes my very inner soul."
688	Sean PazBookLoaner	My friend hung himself a week ago....meth did it to him..
689	J Luther	I doubt Mr Reznor realized he Was writing a Johnny Cash song
690	joecoool100	Who would have ever known that a young Trent Resner would channel the pain of this old man and place his loving words into this man’s mouth and shaking hands as his magnum opus, his last long , loving goodbye…….
691	WysteriaGuitar	A masterpiece as only Johnny Cash the master can interpret it...
692	Bobby Walker-Clickfu	Hurt and Rusty Cage remakes by Johnny Cash are both brilliant
693	William Nash	His most emotionally provocative song and video to close out his life. Well done, sir. Respect. You are the man.
694	B A	I heard Trent Reznor say that after he saw this video he realized this was no longer his song. This is a masterpiece.
695	rick oddo	Killing it right up to his death, See you in heaven John!
696	Knuckles_loves_pudding	Rip Johnny cash he died at the age 71
697	Olivier	Allright, i'm crying. Again.
698	Stefanos	❤❤😢
699	Dante Trevisan	This song hits different depending if you listen to it in your teens or your nearly....for me near 40's.
700	Marcelo Rodrigues	A voz do Johnny só melhorou com o tempo
701	DarkMarxSoul	Singing about everyone going away in the end is brutal, whether it's a younger person singing about loved ones abandoning them to their depression or an old person singing about loved ones dying.
702	tripgreat	One of the most devastating news bulletin on Nashville radio was the announcement of Johnny Cash's death. It wasn't totally unexpected, when you knew June Carter Cash had passed away, it seemed almost inevitable. Still, it hit like certain deaths of people that seem they have always been, and will always be. Elvis, Dan Fogelberg, Jack Benny, Mary Tyler Moore, Ray Charles. Like the sun will stop shining, and the stars will no longer light the skies. The world goes on, but seems somehow diminished.
703	Pyro K2137	If could give 1-5 stars. I would give 100.
704	Wippy Thoughts	Song of the Day.
705	adam mansfield	This is probably the most visceral emotional reminder not to live with regret that ive ever seen. Absolutely beautiful.
706	Paul Elverstone	As a cover; it really is up there with the best but this video just takes it to another level. This is music that you feel, as much as listen to...
707	Cantor Reginaldo Marcelino dos santos	Parabéns bom dia 👏👏👏
708	soccerojdoj	"Perhaps this song should be the response every time some jackass says ""OK Boomer..."". #JohnnyCashsHurt"
709	drabbit61	I hurt myself today to see if I still feel....yes. But, so often we hurt ourselves for the momentary distraction of ....our internal, REAL pain. Loneliness, grief, regret. Everyone I know goes away in the end.
710	Andrew Jackson	Parents are dead, grandparents who raised me are dead, what else do I really have left? Nothing. You will all die alone, as will I. Remember this.
711	MikeGamerGuy	There are very few things that bring a tear to my eye, and almost nothing to make me cry. You, reader, will never know which it was, and either answer you imagine is still painful.
712	dumb shit	Lego Johny cash
713	Patrick Talbot	Remember when MTV gave Timberlake best video award over this? Last time I ever watched MTV
714	กิตติชัย ชัยเศษ	Felix sticking with the one edible Scandinavian dish for 20 mins straight
715	farvista	"This became a novel. Read it or don't. 20 yr. old me really didn't know a thing. 60 yr. old me has memories of young relatives who ODed, leaving 4 little girls under the age of 10 behind, of hearing ""The baby has Downs"" when my SIL had her first child near Christmas eve, of a cousin who made the calculated choice to drink himself to death on a different Christmas eve, of holding my own 2-year-old while my husband told me ""I have a brain tumor"". (That one turned out okay, but in such a circumstance, you get an ICE-COLD, DISTILLED SHOT of what is actually IMPORTANT.) So many other memories, and yet so much less than SOME people have gone through. Job losses, bitter disappointments, infidelity and divorces, terrible accidents, mistakes made, opportunities missed, roads not taken. Eventually, even the most successful people become well-acquainted with loss and regret. And that's okay. These are inevitable. My parents remember 6 weeks spent in a children's ICU, part of a terrible club of desperate parents waiting to see who would take a child home. Their outlook was not good, but nobody else's was either. Accidents, illness, one set of parents who spoke no English, hoping that the doctors in Houston could help their child who had leukemia, and my mother, who spoke Spanish, translating for the doctors that the best that they could do was to make him comfortable, that they needed to say goodbye, that there was no hope. Finally, their child's heart problems + viral pneumonia zeroed out, and a doctor came to THEM and said ""I'm sorry, your baby has died."" While that news was being delivered, however, some doctors decided since that they had nothing to lose, they would take a shot in the dark, try something crazy, and they somehow managed to resuscitate the child, then get her stabilized. (She was fine, eventually.) THAT ONE MOMENT when they they had been told that their child was DEAD, and later, when that horrible, final news GOT TAKEN BACK had an effect on every single choice my dad and mom ever made for the rest of their lives. My mother's motto became ""If everyone is okay, the rest, we can fix."" They saw the true worth of joy, and gratefulness. They NEVER missed a chance to laugh and dance, to spend time, to say ""I love you"". Let me tell you, that makes for one amazing childhood. Sometimes, we had next to nothing, but I always felt like we were so rich. Inevitably, there will be a time when everyone is NOT okay, and you'll realize how perfectly that one phrase distills what actually matters. Why relive the ""good old days""? Live in them RIGHT NOW. When you're happy, KNOW YOU ARE HAPPY. Pay attention, be grateful, be joyous, and try to show that truth to others. Don't be one of those folks who say ""I wish I'd known how good I had it."" Be. Here. Now. Say ""I love you"". Go NOW, instead of tomorrow, when it might be too late. (Another bitter regret. I'm so, so sorry, Grampa.) Give to others in their need without keeping score. Abandon pettiness. Remember that you can argue with people and still love them. Never forget what truly matters. This is your life. Don't get so caught up in static and minutiae that you MISS IT."
716	LostEmpireProduction	There is something so haunting about the way Johnny sings this song. It's like I can't stop listening no matter how many times it plays
717	Jose Salazar	i listen to this every time i watch the hangover III hahahha
718	MO	"There's a reason Trent Reznor said ""it's not my song anymore"". Trent had growing up to do when he wrote this, Jonny was truly reflecting on 80 years."
719	Jake Lowe	If this isn't a form of rap I don't know what is.
720	Jj Sands	over rated sentimental fluff; the stones wild horse or angie crushed this.
721	Bart Mix	So glad this exists. One of the most emotional performances I have heard in my 60 years.
722	f4keinternetgrll	it’s beautiful that this song was originally sang by a young man who was searching for himself that was just beginning life, and was then covered by a man at the end of his life looking back at his accomplishments and wishing he could go back. truly beautiful, and truly one of the greatest covers of a song ever.
723	Robert	💔
724	Craig Veillette	If you’re here, I know how you feel. This is literal medicine, but too much medicine can be bad. Enjoy this masterpiece at your own risk!!! Love you
725	Dale Shelden	This song is about acceptance!
726	Mason McEwen	Rest in piece great legend
727	P&C Life 2023	This version should've been number 1 on the Top 10 Saddest Sondgs on Rolling Stone list 😢
728	Steven Mostyn	Trent's lyrics plus Johny's voice equals one of the greatest songs ever!
729	cuthbert mcvane	This song is enough to make you shed a tear.
730	Lil Git	I've just recently spent 6 weeks recording my 75 year old Dads amazing stories. He had the most amazing life until a brain hemorrhage slowed him down in '94. I had the privilege of spending 6 weeks, hour upon hour over those 6 weeks recording him. One day he'll be gone and I'll have the most amazing memories.
731	Candice D	❤
732	Eric Dunn	Trent Reznor had a lot of respect for Johnny Cash to tell him that this song is no longer his, That it now belongs to Mr Cash.
733	Danny Thomson	as a man who had a stroke in 2014 caused by heroin addiction, this song wrecks me and turns me into a bag of bubbling emotion every single time! every single line means something to me and my broken life, the line about the needle tearing a hole is especially meaningful to me. R.I.P. Johnny Cash.
734	G B	Everyone I know goes away in the end. Truer words have never been spoken.
735	RAP 4Live	This is one of the most emotional songs ever made. I have tears in my eyes at age 25. Cant imagine how it must feel being an old man...
736	Itachi Uchiha	Simply Beautiful..... Had me think about how small our world ..... And how big the mind perceives it. It also reminds me of regrets.
737	Graham Richardson	For me, this is without doubt, the single greatest cover version of all-time. Absolutely stunning. It punches you right in the gut, the pain in his voice, the emotion he pours into it is just incredible. Music without feeling is nothing, this has it all. Utterly brilliant. ❤️
738	Jeremy Jukich	From Jeremy Jukich to Dan Jukich. I miss my dad dearly every single day. He passed away on November 28th at 1:03pm.
739	John Blowe	Johnny cash cover is a masterpiece in itself.

747	sirspikey	Such a brilliant cover
748	Lawrence O Loe	I don't know how others feel about it, but the lines 'You are someone else, and I am still right here' hits me harder than anything else does in this song.
749	kln1	It's a sad song and nonetheless i feel better after hearing it. Pure catharsis.
750	JG	❤ Reznor and Cash
751	Kevin Forth	Been listening to music for nearly 60 years, and no song has consistently hit me as hard as this song. His voice and the imagery combine to make an incredibly powerful emotion. Well done, and as Trent Reznor said, it's no longer his song.
752	Tygear	If you finish that song dry eyed you’re a bot
753	Daniel Eriksson	It's never to late to repent and regret, Johnny went to heaven, I'm looking forward to see him there one day!
754	rod hall	Wow! If ever a man was singing his heart it's Johnny with this song.

760	Gary Shissler	Johnny Cash RIP with June,your together in the end.❤🙏✌
761	Hogsqueal	seems about right that one of country music's biggest songs is a cover from a different genre
762	Clyde Scott	Still playing it in 2023
763	James Holbrook	The song doesn't make.much sense from a 20 something year old but this is perfect
764	TheEnjoyitall	This man knew how good this song was. This is his show piece, his swan song. The depth and meaning he showcased on this recording shows that even when you're not in the immediate limelight you can still blow people away by creating one of the best covers ever done. Truly, what a masterpiece from all who created it, starting with Trent Reznor.
765	herbmcgruffy	Happy new year what a way to start the year listening to this amazing stuff
766	Mark Passe	Absolutely beautiful, very moving and sad.
767	BodyMoving	I also spilled some of my glass of red wine today when I saw the big Johnny doing it.

774	FELIPPE AUGUSTO MICHELETTI	EU SOLITARIO ESCUTANDO ESSA MUSICA LINDA
775	Non Negotiable	I'm not into country western music besides Cash. This song ment a lot to him and needed to be brought to light. I think we can all relate to this masterpiece.
776	John Allsup	I watched this while halfway through this yt video about this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z9pB4yI-BQ
777	Zach martin	"You sing the main coarse to your girl when she asks if you'd still love her if she was worm. ""You can have it ally empire of dirt"""
778	jaim haas	2023 and this song is as POWERFUL as ever. It reminds me of my feelings after Divorce.
779	Wesley Nichols	Saying you have regrets at 20 doesn't really mean much, you have your whole life to figure it out. But when you're Johnny's age and talking about regret, it has a whole new meaning. Johnny Cash is one of the GOAT's.
780	eslingur	This is a requiem for the America I loved
781	Jim Panse	I love the song from the first time I hear it. once i hear it i can't stop.
782	Evan Hughes	I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
783	Serge Le-Gal	best songs ive ever heared ;) rip cashy ;) peace
784	 — 𝐂𝐀𝐑𝐑𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐒𝐔𝐍.	There is something very tragically beautiful about Johnny Cash's life. If there was one country musician I could name that transcended so many different genres and inspired everybody from rockers to popstars to rappers, it's him. I wouldn't say that the end of his life was the peak of his career - but it's very inspiring and bittersweet that he spent so many years in a slump after the 70s only for his music to find a new sense of love, relativity and acceptance with Gen X and Millennials. I've never been a believer in an afterlife, but if there is, I hope he's cozy somewhere and no longer struggling with feelings of depression and isolation.
785	andy georgiou	His leaving song, what a Christian!!
786	sarjus	Одна из лучших перепевов, как собственно почти все песни из «американской» серии! Джонни, мы не плачем, что ты умер — мы гордимся, что ты был!
787	Plane Reality	What is amazing for me... I really related in many ways to the NIN cut. I never let it show externally. In those quiet moments alone... driving. I would wrestle with my internal conflicts... and that song defined a big part of it. I was in my young adulthood then. Fast foreword to now. Getting close to 50... I have lived through so so much. Tragic loss... horrible injuries... estranged loved ones... so so many regrets. I carried the world on my shoulders when young... thought I could change people... if only I loved them harder. Now looking back still constantly analyzing... finding my flaws... a meat grinder of things I can never go back to do different. Has it made me a stronger and better person... yes. I realize now slowly... to forgive. It is the only way foreword. To forgive myself... just because things were so bad... most of it is and was then out of my control. Do I still sit alone... sobbing some times. Yes. Slowly healing... learning how to Love. There was another Man that carried the World on His shoulders. Much Love and Blessings all! Jesus Christ is the Way/Truth/Life! 💪❤🙏💯
788	Alain Brisson	This is so emotional and powerful, I can’t tell how my feelings are when I listen to this masterpiece. Absolutely beautiful!
789	Jim	Johnny's wife was in treatment at the betty ford center in nineteen eighty 9, Johnny would come there for lunch every day to visit his wife I got to meet them both while I was there for 30 days They are very very very nice people i'm glad I got to meet them
790	BonSang	when you are young you look like yo parents, when you are old you look like your choices.
791	Jim Eagle	Nobody remembers that this is a NIN song? That’s odd. Trent Rezner wrote and recorded this in the 90s
792	J Lisko	There has never been a more perfect and literal swan song than this. For anyone else. Likely never will be another.
793	Mansur Haq	Amazing lyrics! Such a deep and moving masterpeice..
794	Beau Stange	GREAT video! I was a Nine inch Nails fan and enjoyed some of Johnny’s early work. I honestly don’t know if I discovered this song by Johnny for about 5-7 years after it came out. When I’m feeling the pain of everyday life I’ll listen to it at the gym to remind me that many have suffered far worse. Thank you!
795	Frederick Lepage	Sa pogne à coeur ostie oui tes mon idole reste fort 🤟🤟🤟✌️🤙👍

809	Mafia Performance	Reznor said in 2005 it wasn’t his song anymore. That’s powerful.
810	underlipetx	It’s a great sign when the most viewed graph behind the play bar is just a plateau. The entire experience is worth it, beginning to end.
811	firekind1980	fuck me. Theres a lesson to us all. fuck this song.

825	Kris One	Finally,THE MAN COMES AROUND. THEIRS NO GRAVE THAT CAN HOLD MY BODY DOWN!!! 🎹✝️💔✝️
826	Tyson Thomas	Trent Reznor made a beautifully haunting song. Johnny Cash took it and ripped everyone's heart out! The pain in his voice says it all! Dang, even when Reznor sang it.... PAIN! Both are legends!
827	rhys aston	I'm only 23 years old and have made quite a few mistakes that I sorly regret and brings me to tears whenever I think about them too much. This man was much older than I am and has definitely made a lot more life changing decions that I have even when he was my age. This is a man who has regretted many of them. I see this song as a confession of these decisions and as advice from a wise old man to be careful of your decisions and that living life to the fullest doesn't always mean having the finer things in life. Thank you for your wisdom Mr Cash.
828	Bayne Bogdanov	Reznor can’t be mad!! Shit!! Johnny Cash
829	GG	One of, if not The Greatest Cover of All Time!
830	Candice Perry	I can't describe the feeling this song gives me but very emotional
831	Faizan Riasat	In the end, you are all alone with your empire of dirt
832	Reticulosis	I remember I was about to leave for school one morning when this song came out. I was a freshman in high school at the time.
833	David Rivera	I'm Hurt because I lost Johnny RIP Key
834	Pelaw Keith	Mesmerising such a beautiful song sung perfectly
835	Kinoga Michael	I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I'm still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way
836	Ben Sturm	I wonder how this touches trent. Because it completely crushes me.
837	chuck canuck	The greatest cover in the history of music videos.
838	seraj mehrabkhani	shout out to Rick Rubin
839	Tea	Rest in Peace, Johnny
840	frailty	"as someone who went from being a hobbyist video editor to a hobbyist musician, this music video is a masterpiece by the way it utilizes both. its not just the song that makes it so powerful, its the video as well, the way it cuts to videos of Johnny earlier in life over certain lyrics. People overuse the word ""haunting"" in my opinion but I cannot think of a more fitting description. it sort of stays and lingers in your mind for a while."
841	Jim Rose	The vocals are great but something is wrong with the key in this version...it least that's the way it plays back for me Anyone else or am I losing it ?
842	Suzanne	Love you Johnny
843	Sephiroth Joutsen	As a hard core Nine Inch Nails fan, when this first came out, I didn't know what to think about it. Trent Reznor wrote it back in the mid 90's about his struggle with Heroin Addiction. I have grown to love this version and I understand why Trent signed over the rights of the song to Johnny Cash and his family.
844	Jim Grant	IMO this is one of the greatest, arguably the greatest, music videos ever recorded. This is a true masterwork by Mark Romanek and Rick Ruben. Stunning.
845	iTz Olie	What an incredible thing music is... for a cover of a song to convey a completely different meaning is just unbelievable. Thank whoever you need to that we have music because, I guarantee you, we wouldn’t be here without it.
846	Flow Euphoria	It hurts to relate to this as much today as it did 12 years ago
847	Jordan Garner	This song came on in the car on the night of my first date with my girlfriend who passed away by suicide recently. I still vividly remember her asking me the name of it and how she really liked it. So every time I listen to this song I think of her very deeply and my own hurt.
848	Mr. Middleton	2:25 This song changed a lot for me, I see it as more than a cover which I’m sure a lot of people see it the same way. It’s a matter of realisation and regret and coming to terms with what you’ve done and accomplished in life, I’m not old to where I can reminisce, but I’m old enough to know life is limited and will end eventually. I hope everyone who watches this music video and sees this comment has an amazing life as I may not meet you, but you all deserve amazing opportunities and outcomes. Be yourself and be happy
849	magnolia Nunn	Love him....💕
850	Sunshine Moon	Listen to Johnny Cash's sings before he had passed you can have my empire but you have dirt meaning he was I can relate leeches people just wanting everybody it's anyway I don't have to explain myself those who are older maybe we'll understand those
851	garyryan52	I was raised in the 50 and 60s and loved Cash. My son was a Nine Inch Nails fan and when this video came out I explained a what the images were of. He looked at me and said this is the greatest video ever made. I told him it just told a story and that's what most Cash songs did.
852	morgan catherwood	Not a dry eye in the house
853	Z's Axe Shed	"God this song makes me ""hurt"""
854	Brandon Hardaker	Amazing song
855	Renate R	Everybody I know goes away in the end ........... hurt ......... no one will ever describe it better...... hurt

857	Mary Beck	No words, wow

884	Shane	..and so, it is Written, just as E= MC², this thing Noel Scum f'ears actually is part of what the Kreatori Destoy R is, ALL of THAT is The Foundations of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. This I know so well as I have experienced the presence of The lord for the last years ago way to this point I'm attempting to make, as Johnny Cash waits, and he shall start playing his song, WRITTEN for The Creator of ALL THINGS. I am being used as a governor, of sorts, perhaps a point of origin, a .P'eon, a .beacon, a ¡'eacon,, a qeacon, something embedded into a two dimensional substrate that receives and sends information. It can also be usedas an adjustment monitor and this is exactly what is taking place while I am listening to music on my smartphone.. my emotions are being monitored and by carefully analyzing my state of being to that state of being of the smartphone, in exact t times and in this Space my state of being is dialed in with exact precision. The state of being of one human, IS USED, as a Transmission T'owe R. u u u urin. I am P. I AM T. I AM R. I M. It IS ALL DONE. I AM Chosen. B'lessed. IsohioioIowa. Hello Sue. My name is Andrea. How du u du🕺
885	Frederick Coppenhagen	this song has gotten me through so much in my life. Just a reminder that even when you feel empty and alone, you go through hell just to make others feel love when you don't.
886	Mike Ruzza	The first few notes give me tears. This song belongs to Johnny Cash now. Nine Inch Nails knows Johnny took it from them. Johnny was, and is the greatest sort of troubadore made in the U.S.A. Let's rename Tennesee johnny cash!!
887	Paul Beaney	It scares me to get old. Not death, that's just time and time is both a friend and an enemy. What scares me is having the wisdom to look back on my life and judge myself. It scares me to have the foresight to close the piano and rest.
888	Braden Harris	So interesting singing this song meant something SO different to Trent and Johnny at their different ages. Amazing connection.
889	Rafão Gamer	Johny cach toca até no Brasil🇧🇷
890	Pill Cosby	😢 i get emotional listening to this everytime
891	Kwazi Rich	Wow, what a Powerful song.
892	Nikki	Love love love this ♡
893	Davide Bertoletti	The video really enhances the power of both the music and the lyrics. Very well conceived.
894	Carmen Bayliss	"The NIN original is, certainly, ultra-fab, but Cash's rendition moves me more because it's more stripped-down. Plus, he's always been ""a God"" in my musical world."
895	David Garris	🐾🐕🐶. Can't say anything
896	D B	Wow.😔
897	bobsuruncle	"If anyone has an empire of dirt to show for the years of ""prospecting"" for gold and riches and fame, of finding it... Johnny Cash is one of them... and he left us a legacy... not because of riches or fame, but because he was true to his giftings...and I suppose, true to the giver of those gifts... Not a perfect man... but he who is?"
898	Maghen Shaw	This is painful n beautiful
899	Kirsten Ornelas	Never loved a remake the way I love this. So much emotion and feeling there and his legacy is perfect with the lyrics.
900	CodenameJulia	I’m noticing a lot of very recent comments on this video (as of 12/26/2022). So many of you have suffered. So many of you are in pain. And I understand that, so deeply - I carry a lot of hurt and healing wounds too. Random internet people, I’m so glad you’re all still here. I’m so glad you’re all still breathing, trying, grieving, loving. We may all be strangers, but we’re still here. Whoever you are, whatever you’re going through, I love you, and I’m so glad you’re still here. Please don’t go away.
901	Simple man	God Bless You, My Friend !!!

907	Adam Pro	Upon the liars chair pouring the wine all over the table. If you aren’t moved by this you are not human.
908	DarkStormHero	This is a man who has hurt , knows the pains of life. Respect
909	Thaq.9-4.5th-6	💔
910	Metallian81	So here I am coming to this video after seeing it in a recommended reaction video. This song gets me every damn time. But it hit me extra hard this time. I dont know why, but it just got me thinking of my dad who passed last year. Then I realized the loss never hit me for some unknown reason. Until now. WTF! 😔
911	Jay Vantol	"Thank you Johnny. See you soon my friend. When my ""empire"" expires. Johnny knew the way to paradise."
912	Whitevaliantwarrior	🎼 He made this song his...
913	ScottySixBites	Damn that’s good. Perfect song for him at that point in his legend. Perfect producer and director. Might be best cover of all time
914	Alexander Mylne	This makes me cry every time...
915	Bill Dance	If that does not bring tears to your eyes, call a doctor now!
916	Tenório Cavalcanti da Silva	So sad song. So simple, so deep.
917	Jack Havo	They threw me into the hole for 14 days innocent! the third day I discovered I can ask the guards for some radio to put up. The second song that played was Hurt, also the only song that I needed back then with my back against the cold wall.
918	halemcdan1	I love this song so much I bought a guitar too learn how to play it. At the age of 50. 3 years later I still love playing it..... and I now have 7 guitars and a real appreciation of music and musicians.
919	Muhammet Aydın	I came here with advice of chatGPT
920	Reinhard Schuster	Straightforward, faithful and honest to the end. My very greatest respect Johnny.
921	JoeyGemini63	The song is an apology to June for all the pain he caused her because of his drug addictions throughout their life together. He knows he doesn't have much time left to tell her he is sorry. Trent, you are an earth angel for giving Johnny this song. No one needed it or deserved it more that he did. It couldn't have gone to a more appropriate music man. No one else could have performed Hurt so powerfully and true. The age in his voice made him sound better than ever.
922	Morrisson	Джонни.,,.

924	Sonya Stephens	I have lost almost every person I have ever loved. This is what I’m listening to. Fck Christmas 2022. I’m tired of the sandman taking everyone except me.
925	Alex Kastano	i am no lying ... i got so deep in to the video that at the end of it his hands on that piano cover turn in someone else hands and that piano cover become a top of the casket...

932	GruesomeGreenWitch	Most incredible, beautiful, humane video. If people would understand how time will destroy everything they have and are, how broken and insne we all are, maybe we'd all treat each other better.🖤💔❤‍🩹🤍
933	BRAINWASHED	If you dislike this you haven't experienced enough life to understand.
934	ammar Ali	What have I become, My Swedish friend
935	Mark M	Beautiful song. A lifetime, and he knows, being himself was the best he could've ever done. The memory he wanted to leave us? Be true to yourself, love heartily and remember, it is the people that count most. Not the empire of dirt we so often strive for. Thanks Johnny.
936	InfoScholar	RIP the good man. We remember you, great soul.
937	YHWH OMEGA	I focus on the pain and give it to God te only thing it’s real
938	J1M1 J3nkins	Trent Reznor who? If this wasn't the perfect song for Johnny Cash at the perfect time, we would never have experienced it like this. Thank you to Trent Reznor for creating one of the best Johnny cash covers ever.
939	pointdexteryeah	My brother was only 31 and died on hospice 3 months ago. I miss him dearly.

949	michael cooper	This version is so much better then nine inch nails and I can't stand cover versions of songs
950	Byron Hilyard	I heard this song back when in 2003. I absolutely bawled my eyes out. I had not cried like that in years. I never make it through this song without crying. When he visited his home from years past. That really digs it in deeper.
951	Олександр Присяжний	legend
952	À pied à Tokyo	Everyone dies. Not everyone was Johnny Cash.
953	Vendetta	❤️🇬🇷 Respect! 🤠

957	ItsMeGPZ	This is a man at the end of his life, every choice behind him, wracked with grief after the loss of his wife, that is so incredibly sad, this is the only song I've cried about. When you're in your 20s, you can turn things around. A man with so much talent had his success cut short, and this is his ballad to the past. The loud bits are heavier than any weight you could lift.
958	berend nap	I searchst old guy singing sad song for this
959	Игорь Гинчицкий	Хочется жить, слушая такие песни !!!
960	ANJIL BHUJEL	Yes what I became my sweetest friend...I can understand this song coz I also can't feel anything anymore .it's too hard to live in planet earth..
961	Scott#	the Greatest Cover of all time. that is all
962	EJC	If I could start again , a million miles away, I would keep myself, I will find a way 🙂
963	James Hall	Tears are rolling. RIP Johnny. fellow songwriter. You made us proud. RIP
964	archiveseeker	I was a big NIN fan. I know Trent Reznor agrees that Johnny Cash successfully hijacked this song.
965	Matryx	whats crazy is that most of Johnny's later songs are Covers. But they became his songs through the sheer emotion he conveys through the lyrics and music.
966	Victor Davidson	You’ve found a way My brother You were an angel in disguise a friend Something I hope to be to someone or anyone the world thanks you mr cash
967	C	Meaning is amazing. I understand. I feel the same way. Thank you JC
968	Vulgarr the Viking	"I remember when this came out 20 years ago. I listened to it and said ""He sounds like he's saying goodbye."" A few months later he was gone."
969	Scott	You do what you got to do and then you look back...
970	Floyd Blue	He told My life, as if he had walked in my shoes. I am moved and torn in two, by the truth 🥺
971	MarcusDidiusFalco	Whenever I feel.... lonely, betrayed, abandoned - I come here. And I know I'm not walking this cold, long mile alone.
972	Daryl	John Franklin cash and I am a young man this is from Willie usserys son
973	xela	Cette chanson transcende le temps et l'esprit
974	Stuttering Cris	Whay have I become my Swedish friend? What? 🥺🥺😔😔💔
975	Jennifer LeBlanc	I used to revere this man & cried to this particular song but as I got older I realized as painfully beautiful as it is it is a narcissistic anthem. He only suffers as his vessel/ body breaks down but he broke many hearts, souls & kin on his downward spiral to his ascendance. Don't get me wrong I love his music but had realizations of his pandering arrogance. He is only regretful now because of those he harmed (ardent fans, family, mama, the downtrodden, the church, IRS & his many children) are left to question ❓ I will still listen to the music but hear it with a different pair of ears. I mean take the song about him stealing car parts off the assembly line? Iffin he was a black guy he'd have died in jail. This is a modern Grimms Fairytale.
976	Peter Richmond	What an absolute masterpiece
977	Maria Kavanagh	Rest in peace Sir. Cash you absolute fucking legend
978	AxiomExotic	I remember first hearing this in the trailer for Prototype 2, and i instantly fell in love :D
979	Ricky Strauss	Well said....go with god!
980	Callum Clarke	Rest in peace brother in Christ Jesus lord and saviour. You are in peace in Christ finally
981	Luca Vagnarelli	Most poetic farewell ever

988	p W	Bono said it best, Trent was born to write this song, Johnny lived to sing this song.
989	Marcelo luna	Un grande... el señor jhonny cash hermosa cancion
990	My Dog Is Bipolar	This really is the greatest cover ever.
991	Ole Riis-Vestergaard	Epic - Rest In Peace Johnny man what a journey you took us all on you Will be missed here on earth
992	Ezy Jamez	Listened to this song over many a number of occasions. And it reminds me of the mess-ups I have done that has lead me to this day. Listening to this reminds me how much I have done wrong to others and myself. 2 Legends sing this song, and both convey such meaning that hits deep down.
993	Jutta Muthig	Er war im Alter fast noch tiefgründiger
994	Wan Ontalay	"""Hurt"" is somehow connected to this song in my mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_DVS_303kQ&list=RDp4zluA60hjs&index=9"
995	Alyssa Martinez	This song will always make sense when nothing else doezz
996	Connie Markley	I love this song and Johnny cash he is and always will be a legend
997	A megalodon with internet access	Thank you johnny cash you saved my life with this song during 2008 i was going through a very dark time my wife had left me my son came out as a gay and my president lost to a black man im very glad you released this song i was really hurt seeing a dirty a negro in office and hearing this song really made me feel empowered and proud of my white heritage i was in arkansas and passed through your the town of your birth on my way to harrison the headquaters of the kkk to pay my respects i was blasting this song all the way there!!!! i am dissapointed that you dated a negro in the 1960s but thats okay we all made mistakes. Thank you again
998	megalo maniac	i never liked music like this till i heard this song im 33 and have the pain of most men before they die
999	MysteryMan	I'm a good enough looking dude,with decent enough social skills, people try to interact with me,but they don't know this song is literally me
1000	raymon kravagna	Maybe the saddest song ever. Tears my heart out to see him like this.
1001	Dave P	You can see the broken man...the stroke. Tell me you don't, and I'll call you blind.
1002	Dave P	I don't want to be old. I think Johnny taught me that.
1003	Lord Drakkon 7367	The cover that went so hard everyone forget it was a cover
1004	Mee Here	FJB AN IT'S CARTEL,
1005	gerkenator	I appreciate how he made this song his and shows at the end our flaw as people. We killed our creators flesh. Johnny Cash clearly got it.
1006	Red Skywalker	Everyone of us is broken & beyond repair..so much that God sent his only begotten son to die for our transgressions as John 3:16 declared
1007	Nash Brooklyn	that beating pulsing note hurts everyone who still has soul inside -
1008	Vemost	Trent Reznor wrote a masterpiece. Poets like Trent and Johnny are of another breed. They can somehow turn the spoken word, into something tangible. Transporting us through time. Spilling their souls out for all to see. We're scared at what we're about to witness, but we must learn. They're warning us . Life isn't easy, and time is fleeting. So follow your Bliss young people!! This aint no dress rehearsal!
