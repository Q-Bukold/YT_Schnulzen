57	Mat	My goodness, I really need to get more back into Pink Floyd.	Pink Floyd

70	Maria Lorenzo	I made sure all my three boys listened to this song before starting school. Today they still love this amazing band …. Who wouldn’t?	Pink Floyd
71	Karim Marhraoui	The director, Alan Parker, doesn't get any credit. The technical aspects of this scene (hell of this entire movie) are mind-blowing. The average person will simply enjoy the song which is of course a masterpiece but the fact that someone thought to shoot this scene this way in the 1980s is astonishing. May you rest in peace, Mr. Parker. You will forever be remembered for giving us such a feast for the eyes.	Pink Floyd

76	S I O M A I	I am a 2nd year college student right now, and it makes me tear up a bit knowing how this song is still dead on accurate with today's education system. I knew this song since I was a kid and was honestly terrified of the video, but now I'm horrified because what this song says is true.	Pink Floyd
78	Добрый Самурай	There are no such geniuses and there will not be!These masterpieces are relevant at any age!	Pink Floyd

102	Ireneusz Duma	the lyrics are still up to date	Pink Floyd
103	Joe Parker	This was a huge single for them. In the day of waiting for the newest song that you love to come on the radio. Waiting by the radio. Waiting. And then it comes on. And you lose your mind all over again. That's one thing that younger people will never be able to appreciate. There was magic in the songs then because of that. A different kind of magic. Or maybe a deeper appreciation.	Pink Floyd
106	Caitlin Chap	This song is now 40 years old and still as popular as ever 	Pink Floyd
110	José Maria de Oliveira Souza	PINK FLOYD CLÁSSICO DOS CLÁSSICOS ......	Pink Floyd

181	KM Ko	probably one of the first songs of this genre I listened to.. around 15 years ago when I was in highschool, this song kept playin in class in my mind, continuously.. i was a straight A valedictorian of the school, always striving for 100 - that was my motto. just raw ambition for studying, but had not much meaning in studying - no interests in the topic at hand, just wanted to be at top. this song got stuck in my head so much and probably changed my life. got into an ivy league school and dropped out after 2 years to find something that's actually has meaning in my life. feels free, stable, and happy i got to discover a road that might be thorny but is not controlled by labels and standards. this music is the embodiment of free spirit n breaking out of the matrix	Pink Floyd

238	Telpenariel	I remember one of the junior high/ high schools I went to as a teen played this song - among others - over the PA system for the entirety of the last day of school. It's one of the few neutral memories I have of that particular school. Most of them are negative and I can't actively recall any positives which my therapist tells me is a symptom of Post Traumatic Stress.... I have no idea if this is accurate or not, but somehow - watching this video - I get kind of a cathartic feeling... I suppose even if the diagnosis is wrong that place still messed me up on some level to get that reaction from me. This comment has been a reflection on memory, music, emotional trauma and how the three can come together to provide a sense of relief.	Pink Floyd

I've never been to a school MORE strict MORE disciplined than my school. I feel like I'm in a prison even the school gate looks like a prison gate with police men guarding it (it's not police men lol their costumes just remind me of police men). The counselors don't even give me any advice when it comes to bullying. I speak my heart out and tell them what's happening and they tell me, ""Ok what do you think you can do about it?"" HOW SHOULD I KNOW THAT""S WHY I""M TELLING YOU ABOUT IT! I can't wear to much jewelry, I can't wear to much makeup, I can't listen to music during any breaks or study hall, it was fun when people weren't breaking the rules with phones I could just block out my bullies with music and chill. Now I just draw and put my feelings on the page and block them out that way then they rip it off the desk. It's better than nothing though. It's like they're taking all these people who are just different and weird from all around the world and turning them into normal people they're all smiling robots. Normal is boring. They tell me to be myself but I can't be myself because I'm different not normal. "	Pink Floyd

751	Mr. Reach	"In 1980 this song was banned in South Africa. Life imitated art in early 1980 when South African school children, fed up with an inferior apartheid-era education system, took to chanting the lyrics of Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)."" The song, with its memorable line stating, ""We don't need no education,"" had held the top spot on the local charts for almost three months, a total of seven weeks longer than it did in America.

I'm now in my 80""s, however my last day at school in Lincoln, in the UK, I stole every cane I could find in the school and laid them on the rail tracks which ran past the school. Word must have passed round, so when the next train came rumbling through, it destroyed all the canes. The school erupted with cheers which went on and on. Teachers quickly rushed around asking what was going on? Eventually some bloody do-gooder told them what and who. When I saw them coming for me, I did a runner and managed to get away. Perhaps I was one of the bricks that didn't quite fit the wall."	Pink Floyd

Those masks frightened me and watching the kids getting ground up as the teachers ate the meat haunted my dreams. The teacher's voice reminded me of an angry nazi's so I thought this song was related to the Holocaust somehow. A decade later, I'm 18 and The Wall is one of my favorite albums and movies of all time to the point that I listen to the songs on a daily basis. It's amazing how much experience and maturity can affect you. This album is one of the most important and relatable things I have ever heard that it will always hold a special place in my heart.

Ao longo dos anos, a música foi usada como uma forma de protesto contra qualquer tipo de sistema totalitário, opressivo e autoritário. Tornou-se um símbolo de resistência contra esses regimes, não importa a esfera. Em 2021, centenas de pessoas se reuniram para cantar essa música em protesto aos regimes totalitários e restrições impostas por diversos governos no mundo todo. Contra a exigência do passaporte sanitário e a favor da liberdade. Que os canadenses possam resistir e continuar lutando por seus direitos. Hey, Trudeau, leave those people alone! Repudiar qualquer forma de violência é obrigação de todos.	Pink Floyd
1003	Anti• Brown	eu lembro a capa desse disco tinha um olhão eu com 3 anos de idade e meu pai no auge da lombra pirando nos Pink Floyd e hoje eu entendo toda essa loucura sideral que ele vivia.	Pink Floyd

1022	Maximo Nacer	It took Just ten years...1979 when this song came to life to 1989 with the opening of the Berlin Wall...Life, Liberty and Property are powerful concepts. The educational system was not supposed to become a place to sequester valuable funds of the children but to keep their minds open and to produce positive outcomes so that is exactly what has happened...we do not need more education but private property because we can use it now to generate clean energy...hydroelectric power	Pink Floyd

1137	Old Warrior	You must understand the era. These incredibly talented people were raised in the super-conformist late 40s through the early 60s; and this song relates directly to the mind control pushing conformism.

Better than destruction and negative elements to discourage learning now students are individual s with there pace to complete their assignment s. With computer tops and meeting s on internet and for tests too. Amazingly a better situation for change and growth. Great song to reflect on this subject.	Pink Floyd

Nasci , muori e quel poco che ci rimane ci beviamo sopra , ci prendiamo qualche cosa per stare svegli e cambiamo partner e quando a nostro piacimento ci meravigliamo se quella donna o quell ' uomo non si interessa a noi....Se siamo troppo a connessione , non vediamo. Il meraviglioso cambiamento del sole che non eta come quando ero bambina...esso appariva per poco e poi scompariva con freddo che ghiacciava le strade e le pozzangole. fino al rientro a scuola...Dentro di noi abbiamo sia conscio che inconscio la voglia di sentirsi i Primi o gli Ultimi...e i secondi , rispecchiano come nel Golgota il nostro Gesù...E noi , andiamo avanti e speriamo che qualcosa cambi..anche i nostri fratelli Maggiori ora stanno un po"" a guardare , hanno un po' paura di aver preso in mano il mondo...ora tocca a noi soffrire .....Quanti galli a cantare e le galline hanno ripreso a fare le uova , e nascono i pulcini e vogliamo. farli stare sotto le ali della chioccia per farli stare ancora un po' a godere del loro diritto di essere ospiti di questo pianeta ancora a noi sconosciuto...Grazie Andrea , e liberati da false tentazioni di puntare il dito....anche Gesù è ststo tentato nel deserto e ci invita con la preghiera di donargli la nostra fiducia e saremo salvi al riparo delle sue Ali....grazie di esistere 4 dicembre 2021...grazia P."

1590	A	This song was created some decades ago, still relevant to new education system. Nothing has changed. Where is humanity going. Why are we so blind to see the truth.

1595	jane Doe	This song speaks to my soul... There is nothing else to say... Except... I have had horrible teachers my whole life and just the worst school experiences. I was never bullied though because I could always stand up for myself and I was always friends with everyone (even the bullies) and I stopped them from bullying the rest of my friends... But of course some kids I just couldn't be friends with because they were just awful and rude and apathetic... And I just couldn't be friends with them. And I despise almost every teacher I have ever had. But, there were a couple who were good but they are the 1% to the rest of my 99% of horrible and awful teachers.... Sorry for filling up your screen lol and I hope you all have the best scholastic and academic experiences possible.... Thankyou and goodnight!!!! 	Pink Floyd

It's a group of people who sing songs."" I'm so grateful for that childhood haha. I remember screaming it in recess periods in 4th grade, ""Hey teachers! Leave the kids alone.""

Classic memory."	Pink Floyd
1890	Jagdeep Kaul	Some of this video strongly reminds me of that 1971 movie Soylvent Green which is actually set in the future year of 2022. 2022 is next year and anybody who has watched Soylent Green knows what we have in store for 2022 lmao	Pink Floyd
1891	Imperial Spy #7	Actually from the experience, I learned that school kills creativity because not everyone can be what they want to be, because we need people like construction workers, sewage pipes fixers, and other low paid hard working job in our world, and I know not a lot of people like that type of job, however without them the world will be in a bad state, and also not everybody can become a lawyer, businesses man, and an athlete	Pink Floyd

1912	Susanna Vaccaro	"É incredibile quanto conti l' insegnante per formarti o distruggerti . Per quanto mi riguarda,mi ritengo "" sufficentemente"" fortunata. Nella maggioranza dei casi e periodi,ho trovato appoggio e feeling. Solo in due casi,molto distanti nel tempo, due pessime esemplari,sadiche. Tipo questo "" perdente "" prof,che sfoga la sua nullità come individuo sui ragazzi. Che bello la rivincita! Una,tremenda,proprio come nel video,ha mostrato i miei scarabocchi alla classe( che non l' ha appoggiata per fortuna) e solo perché non usavo scrivere in brutta copia prima. L' anno seguente,cambio scuola e residenza,si ripete tutto con una ex preside di poi insegnante di lettere, che mostra ,( a suo dire) un tema,per far vedere cos' era,una grafia matura. Ho mandato una pernacchia mentale,nell' aria ...all' altra,di matematica.Mh! Ovvia! * Questo brano dei Pink Floyd é indimenticabile , e molto significativo ,sú piú aspetti (ho visto anche il film,), L' abuso di potere,nonché ,la distruzione della passione ..e le conseguenze che né verranno fuori,tra i giovani commilitoni...tutti robotizzati.Agghiacciante!"	Pink Floyd
1914	Wolf The Iron Lord	If you think this isn't schooling anymore, you're fooling yourself. Crushing individualism never stopped, it just got colorful. Part of individualism is difference, and that's quashed in the schools.	Pink Floyd

1928	TheMisterManGuy	Who's here after what happened in Virginia?	Pink Floyd
1929	V W	This song was made at the time musicians really worked with their song and care about the lyrics and bring out a meaning, instead of today's artist who only press some bottoms and add some shitty lyrics about love. Miss the good old days..	Pink Floyd

1970	Bob Bobsen	"All the drama queens in the comments going ""so relevant"" when these early 20th century British schookids would have dreamed of schools like ours."	Pink Floyd
1971	djhvallejo	I remember playing this on the last day of school walking out on last period of middle school and the teacher yelling at me. I just turned it up louder. I was living in a small conservative town in CA that was mainly listening to country and western music. I was a military brat who had traveled all over the world and was only in the states maybe 3 years total so I listen to alot of different music. This was back in 1983. The other kids thought I was so bad ass. I didn't care. I was moving to a different country the next month anyway.,	Pink Floyd
1972	Devany Collis	the song is not against education itself but instead it's against how schools press the students by forcing them to work hard and harder just so they can get excellent marks and forcing them to study some useless subjects , instead of letting them study what they are really into , parents also play an important role in destroying the personality of their children by comparing them to their classmates or comparing them to their cousins who do better than their kids in school which causes depression and anxiety and even creating some suicidal thoughts ! but in fact getting good marks doesn't mean that a student is smarter than the other , it only means that one of them has a good memory than the other or that he or she are working day and night to arrive to this results , this is why I'm against exams because students only revise their lessons to pass THE EXAM and after few months they will forget everything they learnt , otherwise if students felt comfortable they will study to study not to pass the exam . I think that Scandinavian countries already arrived to this point and some European countries also , the educational system of Asian countries is also successful but have you ever observed that too many students commit suicide .... lol it's funny how am I criticizing those educational systems of developed countries while I'm living in a third world country because I gave up on criticizing our educational system , they will never change it because they don't want the population to realize how brainwashed we are .... my people are drowning in an ocean of ignorance , yes I blame the country but I also blame them for not using their brains ..I'm moroccan btw ... sorry if I wrote too much but I just have nobody to tell this to	Pink Floyd
