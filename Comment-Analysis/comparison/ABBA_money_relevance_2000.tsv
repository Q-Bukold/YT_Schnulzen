7	Pumpkinhead	Is it just me, or does anyone else think most ABBA songs would make great heavy metal covers? I just can't hear an ABBA song without imagining what an awesome metal song it would make. I guess when a song is great, it's just great in any genre.

10	Yli4n	I would kill to be a teenager while abba was releasing these bangers

53	RoboTube	ABBA are not just some dorks like many pop bands that have chicks. They make cool parts. The I mean, listen carefully to that piano part to that grooving bass and the rock guitar. They are legit rock , funk parts. Not just a accompanying music for the eyecandy women. Everyone likes ABBA because they have everything. Every instrument that plays is top notch, the pop is there with the hooky vocals. I dont know if these people are conscious about how fucking talented they are. This is as best as it gets in pop.
54	MrFactualGaming	ABBA is one of those bands who will just never die, even after they're gone themselves!

111	robwarriors62	This is actually brilliant songwriting. The modulation at 2:25 isn't just a ham-fisted semitone/half-step lift that most songs do, it's actually set-up beautifully by the intro sequence chords that were established from the start - Am, *F7*, Dm7, E7, Am where the F7 is the V of the new key, Bb minor. Little connections like this go a long way to making your song musically cohesive.

135	Freeroamer97	"this song is actually a really good break down of class analysis. ""I work all night, I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay"". what a beautiful description of capitalist society. It really highlights how the cost of living crisis is impacting us all. ""in a rich mans world"" I believe this line does a great job illustrating how the sexist class culture pressures women to work lower paying jobs such as secretaries. Ironic that anti feminists will turn around and say things like ""the gender pay gap only exits because woman work less hours and lower paying jobs"" while completely ignoring the reasons as to why they might be working those jobs and why they might feel societal pressure to work less hours."

186	„Çµ„Ç∏„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà„Ç™„Çπ„Ç´„Éº	What is worth remembering is that when ABBA went big, they were pretty much hated by most Swedes since Sweden at that time was a socialist hell-hole where everything was supposed to be gray, brown or otherwise depressing. Sticking out, being great was not something that was encouraged and was frown upon. Which makes the music even greater.

And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me That's too bad So I must leave, I'll have to go To Las Vegas or Monaco And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same Todos: Money, money, money Must be funny In the rich man's world Money, money, money Always sunny In the rich man's world Frida: Aha All the things I could do Todos: If I had a little money It's a rich man's world Money, money, money Must be funny In the rich man's world Money, money, money Always sunny In the rich man's world Frida: Aha All the things I could do Todos: If I had a little money It's a rich man's world It's a rich man's world

306	Demiene Juarana DJ	This song is actually their answer to those opposer in their government or protesters or anti-west because Abba was making songs just for money and was influenced by the west because of their fame in the Eurovision contest by which they won. This is the only, I think societal song or the song that talks about what is happening in their government. Anyways, nice Abba for answering that you do not create songs for the sake of money but through your passion of singing to the rest of the world.

315	War commentary	"The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank introduced in 1940. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than its contemporaries while its 60 degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons. The Christie suspension was inherited from the design of American J. Walter Christie's M1928 tank, versions of which were sold turret-less to the Red Army and documented as ""farm tractors"", after being rejected by the U.S. Army.[citation needed] The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, and had a lasting impact on tank design. After the Germans encountered the tank in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, German general Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist called it ""the finest tank in the world"" and Heinz Guderian affirmed the T-34's ""vast superiority"" over German tanks. Alfred Jodl, chief of operations staff of the German armed forces noted in his war diary ""the surprise at this new and thus unknown wunder-armament being unleashed against the German assault divisions,"" although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war. The T-34 was the mainstay of Soviet Red Army armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34-85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined and rationalized to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht. Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/T-55 series). With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever. Its development led directly to the T-44, then the T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, that form the armoured core of many modern armies. T-34 variants were widely exported after World War II, and as recently as 2010 more than 130 were still in service."

801	epm76	ABBA seems to get the sound of a subject, and this song is a perfect example of how onomatopoeia can work with music and rhythm. It sounds like obsession, desperation and star‚Äîblind pursuit. Amazing. I would know what this song is about even if it were in a completely foreign language. That‚Äôs not just good composition, that‚Äôs good story-telling. I‚Äôm still awed.

906	Chelsea Fooball	"I come from Vietnam. ABBA is my favorite band. When I was a child, the Internet was not developed. I don't know who ABBA is. But I heard their music at that time every New Year on TV was ""Happy New Year"" 's song. This song is very famous and popular in Vietnam. Almost everyone has heard it many times in their life. But people don't know this song from the Swedish group ABBA. When I grew up, the Internet starts to grow , so I'm listening their songs. Yes, their songs are the best. ABBA fills a special place in my heart. It can be said that ABBA is the greatest artist of all time. You guys are so happiness to be born in western countries and listen to ABBA music in the 70s and 80s. If I were to be born again, I wish I had been born in Sweden at that time."

I was playing it again and again on my cassette tape and my older brother hated me for it :-)) Currently my English is much better and I finally see that the translation is much different to what I was thinking when I was very young, but I still love it ! :-)

1577	chelseacharger	"As far as I recall, ABBA made this song as a swipe at their critics who seemed obsessed with the money the group was making at the time. ""More profitable than Volvo"" and stuff like that. And although their record label got involved in all sorts of business deals to supplement their income, it's understandable. Sweden had an eye watering 85% tax rate for big earners. During the years the group was active, none of the four members moved abroad to a tax haven and they lived remarkably modestly compared to the excesses of many of the rock / pop stars of the 70's."
