24	Саша Грицюк	На мой взгляд-- этот вечный хит претендует на первое место в топе 20 века.
25	Adriana Coelho	Quanto è attuale questo video è questa canzone... quanta metafora ricca di messaggi!!! Affascinante argomento per la psicologia sociale, psicologia della devianza... conflitti generazionale che spinge all'evoluzione e al cambiamento. La teoria della conformità , teoria dei comportamenti e della norma di gruppo. Quanto siamo conformisti, o quanto siamo in grado di produrre cambiamenti proattivi?
26	matthewjames	The song is about killing a child’s individuality and uniqueness. Putting them through the “system,” turning them into just “another brick in the wall.”

70	Maria Lorenzo	I made sure all my three boys listened to this song before starting school. Today they still love this amazing band …. Who wouldn’t?
71	Karim Marhraoui	The director, Alan Parker, doesn't get any credit. The technical aspects of this scene (hell of this entire movie) are mind-blowing. The average person will simply enjoy the song which is of course a masterpiece but the fact that someone thought to shoot this scene this way in the 1980s is astonishing. May you rest in peace, Mr. Parker. You will forever be remembered for giving us such a feast for the eyes.
72	Lorraine Laino	I remember Pink Floyd when I was 15yrs old 1973 Dark Side of The Moon,one of the best albums ever made. And to this I play this album what a happy memory I have!!.
73	Guillermo Leiton.	Esta version es la mejor de todas 👍🙌💪
74	kiraz	This song somehow brings me into childhood. Love from 🇷🇺
75	PinkFloyd Addicted	Pink Floyd is not music. Is a portal for another dimension. When i listen to Pink Floyd there's no space around me.
76	S I O M A I	I am a 2nd year college student right now, and it makes me tear up a bit knowing how this song is still dead on accurate with today's education system. I knew this song since I was a kid and was honestly terrified of the video, but now I'm horrified because what this song says is true.
77	Rafael Garcia	Me ha encantado el ritmo y la melodía.
78	Добрый Самурай	There are no such geniuses and there will not be!These masterpieces are relevant at any age!🤜🏼🤛🏼
79	Felicia Rufino	Love this song
80	Allan Avery	A revolutionary video .. a musical gem ! What great sound effects which compliment the relentless rhythm cord !!
81	Andy Subs	Siempre se me pone la piel de gallina al escuchar el coro de la canción cantada por los niños! Se oye tan tétrico, tan surreal... Y la melodía es una joya completa. Éste es uno de los mejores temas de todos los tiempos.
82	МФЦ-Продажа имущества	Pink Floyd Наш Выбор !!!

86	irontwinks	I first heard this song in 1979 when I was in the 8th grade. I am over 50 now and my grade school daughter loves this song. Pink Floyd's music endures over multiple generations...like fine classical music. Shine on!
87	katia mara	Clipe pesado. A música é sensacional!
88	Ashek Ferdous	My first Pink Floyd song. Heard first time probably back in 1994 or even before. Still one of my fav right after High Hopes and Coming Back To Life. Actually love all the Pink Floyd songs...…. Just wish to attend one of their concert......

101	Martin Košek	If you're watching this in 2020 you have a great taste of music.
102	Ireneusz Duma	the lyrics are still up to date
103	Joe Parker	This was a huge single for them. In the day of waiting for the newest song that you love to come on the radio. Waiting by the radio. Waiting. And then it comes on. And you lose your mind all over again. That's one thing that younger people will never be able to appreciate. There was magic in the songs then because of that. A different kind of magic. Or maybe a deeper appreciation.

146	Kelly Springer	A decade later this song has become more relevant to our children than ever before.
147	Rubén Vázquez	God, I love this video. It perfectly reflects what they have tried to implement on generation after generation of children, and the consequent inner rebellion against their enslaving ideology. Interesting enough, we are now coming to an end of this long story, where everyone of us is deciding on which side to stand...
148	Napo Oliveros	"Muchas veces he escuchado gente hablando mal de Roger y no saben de que hablan, el siempre ha sido un "" anti sistema"" eso fue "" Pinkk Floyd"". Eso "" murio"" cuando se fue cuando se fue. ¡ Se fue! David es un maravilloso guitarrista y todos los que le acompañaro pero pero ese grupu "" nacio"" un grupo en contra del sistema, luego de ello, no es Pink Floyd"
149	Angela Colburn	Sublime. Like my school days.
150	Maria Franca Acquadro	Meravigliosi ♥️
151	tyler	The part where the kids fall in the meat grinders, and the people on the train’s masks used to scare the fuck out of me. And give me goosebumps to this day

158	خالد الخضير	I love this song. We were subjected to injustice from this category. I am from this generation. This song should be immortal for generations. I am sad, sad, true. The teacher was an aristocrat. He was ignorant. He learned strength and did not learn education. Ignorant people torment us from them,,,, Want to know who the strangers are?

175	John Guadeloupe	Since I heard this record in the late seventies it has stood the test of time thanks to the David Gilmour guitar solo. 43 years old and still marvellous.
176	Maria Fernanda Weber	Man this song will never lose its shining. Just like its story... Love It.
177	HARD PUNTO Com	A really master piece against the obsolescence of traditional education that is unfortunately present to these days (2022)
178	Chivania	That's the first song i've ever seen from Pink Floyd, im not a fan but i really love it.
179	Edilmar antonio Santos	Amo suas letras Obrigado amigos Brasil agradece...
180	Laure Courboin	Cette version est vraiment la meilleure !
181	KM Ko	probably one of the first songs of this genre I listened to.. around 15 years ago when I was in highschool, this song kept playin in class in my mind, continuously.. i was a straight A valedictorian of the school, always striving for 100 - that was my motto. just raw ambition for studying, but had not much meaning in studying - no interests in the topic at hand, just wanted to be at top. this song got stuck in my head so much and probably changed my life. got into an ivy league school and dropped out after 2 years to find something that's actually has meaning in my life. feels free, stable, and happy i got to discover a road that might be thorny but is not controlled by labels and standards. this music is the embodiment of free spirit n breaking out of the matrix

191	imari2305	The moment when the body, mind and soul of a child is grounded up into a slush of nothingness and creativity is mocked and erased. Powerful video and message!! Pink Floyd is amazing!!
192	DaniellaDD5	Wow.... Amazing! Like a good old red wine 🍷
193	Roger uk	Fantastic song and video but watching it made me sad because it reminded me of how I was treated as a kid at school, they would never get away with it today.

237	Claudio Novais Ramos	Patrimônio cultural da humanidade.
238	Telpenariel	I remember one of the junior high/ high schools I went to as a teen played this song - among others - over the PA system for the entirety of the last day of school. It's one of the few neutral memories I have of that particular school. Most of them are negative and I can't actively recall any positives which my therapist tells me is a symptom of Post Traumatic Stress.... I have no idea if this is accurate or not, but somehow - watching this video - I get kind of a cathartic feeling... I suppose even if the diagnosis is wrong that place still messed me up on some level to get that reaction from me. This comment has been a reflection on memory, music, emotional trauma and how the three can come together to provide a sense of relief.

560	Angela Cavon	"When I first watched the video in this song I thought it was so weird....but now....I get it...everyday I dream of burning the school to the ground. I've never been to a school MORE strict MORE disciplined than my school. I feel like I'm in a prison even the school gate looks like a prison gate with police men guarding it (it's not police men lol their costumes just remind me of police men). The counselors don't even give me any advice when it comes to bullying. I speak my heart out and tell them what's happening and they tell me, ""Ok what do you think you can do about it?"" HOW SHOULD I KNOW THAT""S WHY I""M TELLING YOU ABOUT IT! 😑I can't wear to much jewelry, I can't wear to much makeup, I can't listen to music during any breaks or study hall, it was fun when people weren't breaking the rules with phones I could just block out my bullies with music and chill. Now I just draw and put my feelings on the page and block them out that way then they rip it off the desk. It's better than nothing though. It's like they're taking all these people who are just different and weird from all around the world and turning them into normal people they're all smiling robots. Normal is boring. They tell me to be myself but I can't be myself because I'm different not normal. 💔"

591	Toni e Gih	Na minha opinião o sistema de educação de antigamente, não é como agora! Antigamente a educação era mais rígida e os alunos aprendiam melhor o conteúdo, na época do meu pai coisas que ele aprendeu na oitava série, eu estou aprendendo no segundo ano do ensino médio! De uns anos pra cá veio mudando o sistema de ensino e sofrendo alguns impactos tanto positivo quanto negativo.

601	Doc Brown	man I remember the first time I saw this when I was a kid it blew my mind and changed me forever. These guys are on a whole other level of genius. I listened to one of Jimi Hendrix's last interviews and he was talking about how he enjoyed listening to pink floyd and was planning to be independent and making music similar to Floyd. To imagine what he would have made brakes my heart.

611	The Pict	A milestone in British music, this track went worldwide and resonated through the decades.
612	profeta letters	Mais do que massa. Maravilhoso. Ouço isso desde menino. E olha q já estou com 64..e toda vez q ouço me sinto menino de novo.SAUDADES
613	Mi Ka	Lyrics: When we grew up and went to school There were certain teachers who would Hurt the children any way they could By pouring their derision Upon anything we did Exposing every weakness However carefully hidden by the kids But in the town it was well known When they got home at night, their fat and Psychopathic wives would thrash them Within inches of their lives We don't need no education We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teacher, leave them kids alone Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone! All in all, it's just another brick in the wall All in all, you're just another brick in the wall We don't need no education We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teachers, leave them kids alone Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone! All in all, you're just another brick in the wall All in all, you're just another brick in the wall Wrong, do it again! Wrong, do it again! If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! (Wrong, do it again!) How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat? (Wrong, do it again!) You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie! (If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?) (You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!)

620	Liza	lmao imagine building a brick wall with a few bricks missing. i guess it portrayed the times of the 80's? but listening to this song now, the message behind this song is seems so.. ignorant the modern education system has pushed humans to live in the best of times. in every measurable way, we are better off now as a species.
621	Ricardo Martinez	The Wall is a movie that changed my life. It is a movie not just against authoritarianism within the school system/s, everywhere. But it is also a movie against Nazism, sorry, folks, Nazism as in Ukraine today.

751	Mr. Reach	"In 1980 this song was banned in South Africa. Life imitated art in early 1980 when South African school children, fed up with an inferior apartheid-era education system, took to chanting the lyrics of Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)."" The song, with its memorable line stating, ""We don't need no education,"" had held the top spot on the local charts for almost three months, a total of seven weeks longer than it did in America. Just a cool little tip for those who don't know :)"

790	Nancy Romero	Prophetic.... teachers. Leave the kids alone...
791	Robert Ramsey-Turner	"I love this song, I play it often and always loud, it really is a powerful statement of oppression in the classroom. I'm now in my 80""s, however my last day at school in Lincoln, in the UK, I stole every cane I could find in the school and laid them on the rail tracks which ran past the school. Word must have passed round, so when the next train came rumbling through, it destroyed all the canes. The school erupted with cheers which went on and on. Teachers quickly rushed around asking what was going on? Eventually some bloody do-gooder told them what and who. When I saw them coming for me, I did a runner and managed to get away. Perhaps I was one of the bricks that didn't quite fit the wall."

Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. (Psalms 51:1-4)

Those masks frightened me and watching the kids getting ground up as the teachers ate the meat haunted my dreams. The teacher's voice reminded me of an angry nazi's so I thought this song was related to the Holocaust somehow. A decade later, I'm 18 and The Wall is one of my favorite albums and movies of all time to the point that I listen to the songs on a daily basis. It's amazing how much experience and maturity can affect you. This album is one of the most important and relatable things I have ever heard that it will always hold a special place in my heart.

1000	Jarbas Peixoto Júnior	Lançada em 1979, a canção “Another Brick In the Wall”, da banda Pink Floyd, é uma crítica ao sistema educacional britânico, considerado autoritário e opressivo. Ao longo dos anos, a música foi usada como uma forma de protesto contra qualquer tipo de sistema totalitário, opressivo e autoritário. Tornou-se um símbolo de resistência contra esses regimes, não importa a esfera. Em 2021, centenas de pessoas se reuniram para cantar essa música em protesto aos regimes totalitários e restrições impostas por diversos governos no mundo todo. Contra a exigência do passaporte sanitário e a favor da liberdade. Que os canadenses possam resistir e continuar lutando por seus direitos. Hey, Trudeau, leave those people alone! Repudiar qualquer forma de violência é obrigação de todos.
1001	Uncensored	ЭТО КЛАССИКА МИРОВОЙ МУЗЫКИ В ИСТОРИИ ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСТВА
1002	Leda Solange	Que maravilha! Voltando a década de 70 aqui em S. Paulo Brasil
1003	Anti• Brown	eu lembro a capa desse disco tinha um olhão eu com 3 anos de idade e meu pai no auge da lombra pirando nos Pink Floyd e hoje eu entendo toda essa loucura sideral que ele vivia.

1022	Maximo Nacer	It took Just ten years...1979 when this song came to life to 1989 with the opening of the Berlin Wall...Life, Liberty and Property are powerful concepts. The educational system was not supposed to become a place to sequester valuable funds of the children but to keep their minds open and to produce positive outcomes so that is exactly what has happened...we do not need more education but private property because we can use it now to generate clean energy...hydroelectric power

1137	Old Warrior	You must understand the era. These incredibly talented people were raised in the super-conformist late 40s through the early 60s; and this song relates directly to the mind control pushing conformism. Having still the capacity for critical thinking, PF created music history.

Better than destruction and negative elements to discourage learning now students are individual s with there pace to complete their assignment s. With computer tops and meeting s on internet and for tests too. Amazingly a better situation for change and growth. Great song to reflect on this subject.

1224	jem	Such an awesome song and film clip. Reckon it would have been fun to be one of the child extras, in this film clip although these days the kid actors would probably have counselling after performing because of all the dark themes (but counselling is good so not knocking it he he 😉 )
1225	simon	Day 211 listening to pink floyd for 1 year..
1226	Craig Colbert	I was thinking about this song and how it is probably their most commercially recognized song. Only Pink Floyd could create a song that has the best of everything.
1227	Poeli	Lastima que casi toda la generación juvenil se pierde de estás joyas

1231	Valcirene Medeiros	Essa música é a oitava maravilha da terra! 😃😃
1232	Cristiano	Lembro que em minha época de escola,tínhamos uma professora de ensinos religioso que era bem linha dura. Não tanto quanto a esposa deste professor que aparece no clipe,mas como éramos criança,tínhamos a inclinação de super dimensionar tudo e daí lembro que naquela época,eu achava ela bem pior que essa do clipe. kkkkk Que o espírito dela não se ofenda,se estiver vendo eu debochar dela agora...kkkkk Uns 30 anos atrás,ela deveria já ter essa mesma idade dessa do clipe,então calculo que se não descansou ainda,é por que tá com horas negativa no banco de horas. kkkk Tá pagando... PS: Eu olho o que são os professores de hoje,por força das leis/mimimi e o que era em minha época... Não entendo como os jovens de hoje podem reclamar do paraíso que é hoje! Pra não dizer ZONA! Na minha época não tinha o que tem hoje! ´´A senhora não é minha mãe pra me xingar,tome um soco nos peitos! E lá vinha o POLICIAL MILITAR que fazia a segurança do portão;conter aquele projeto de delinquente juvenil...`` Lembro que já existia a pressão dos pais,sobre a diretora,pois não aceitavam essa abordagem e a diretora não aceitava POLICIAL MILITAR entrando nas salas,mas naquela época as professoras tinha mais voz de comando e falavam alto e grosso! Se não aceita,volte a dar aula e levar soco nos peito,já que gosta! Enfim,a aula era dada aos filhos,mas nunca aos pais e daí não resolvia nada! Como não resolve,agrava! Foi o que aconteceu.
1233	Belmira Santos	Bom dia acho que a musica letra tem a ver com a realidade de vida que nosso Mundo esta a viver
1234	Livia Rayane	Essa música é uma crítica genial!
1235	dwight nix	they played this a lot when we went to the skating rink as a kid. Fun song to skate to.
1236	darknessinside	Just a quick reminder to anyone that never listened to any pink floyd song other than this, wish you were here and money that Pink Floyd's The Wall is (probably) one of the most insanely genius and deep conceptual albums ever written in music history and that this song is just 1/13 of such masterpiece, if you haven't, you should listen to the rest of the album ;) tldr: if you havent, listen to the other The Wall songs, you'll surely be amazed by those

1241	x9A3A8x	Αυτή την συμπεριφορά που περιγράφει το video (1982) το αντικρίζω από την εποχή που οι κυβερνήσεις πολλών κρατών αποφάσισαν να μειώσουν την ελευθερία των ανθρώπων. Με την αφαίρεση των επιλογών του καθενός μας, με την υποχρέωση της αναφοράς, με την επιβολή να ήμαστε πειράματα σε κάποια πειραματικά εμβόλια χωρείς εγγύηση από κανένα κρατικό φορέα και οικονομικές κιρρώσεις αν αρνηθούμε να συμμορφωθούμε.

1502	GRAZIA PISICCHIO	"Grazie , grazie Andrea che ascolti questa musica in silenzio e quelle immagini credo che ti facciano ricordare dei momenti non lieti della vita...Qualche volta ti sarai chiesto perché il Signore non interviene a questi massacri , forse la vita , finisce così. Nasci , muori e quel poco che ci rimane ci beviamo sopra , ci prendiamo qualche cosa per stare svegli e cambiamo partner e quando a nostro piacimento ci meravigliamo se quella donna o quell ' uomo non si interessa a noi....Se siamo troppo a connessione , non vediamo. Il meraviglioso cambiamento del sole che non eta come quando ero bambina...esso appariva per poco e poi scompariva con freddo che ghiacciava le strade e le pozzangole. fino al rientro a scuola...Dentro di noi abbiamo sia conscio che inconscio la voglia di sentirsi i Primi o gli Ultimi...e i secondi , rispecchiano come nel Golgota il nostro Gesù...E noi , andiamo avanti e speriamo che qualcosa cambi..anche i nostri fratelli Maggiori ora stanno un po"" a guardare , hanno un po' paura di aver preso in mano il mondo...ora tocca a noi soffrire .....Quanti galli a cantare e le galline hanno ripreso a fare le uova , e nascono i pulcini e vogliamo. farli stare sotto le ali della chioccia per farli stare ancora un po' a godere del loro diritto di essere ospiti di questo pianeta ancora a noi sconosciuto...Grazie Andrea , e liberati da false tentazioni di puntare il dito....anche Gesù è ststo tentato nel deserto e ci invita con la preghiera di donargli la nostra fiducia e saremo salvi al riparo delle sue Ali....grazie di esistere 4 dicembre 2021...grazia P."

I was never bullied though because I could always stand up for myself and I was always friends with everyone (even the bullies) and I stopped them from bullying the rest of my friends... But of course some kids I just couldn't be friends with because they were just awful and rude and apathetic... And I just couldn't be friends with them. And I despise almost every teacher I have ever had. But, there were a couple who were good but they are the 1% to the rest of my 99% of horrible and awful teachers.... Sorry for filling up your screen lol and I hope you all have the best scholastic and academic experiences possible.... Thankyou and goodnight!!!! 😋😤😭😖😢🙃😜😎😀🤗

So if you step out of class telling your opinion, on solving some problem. The teacher feels like he is not talking to the walls! He feels like he is talking to equal to himself!

1787	sluggotg	"This Album is absolutely one of my favorites ever. Yes I was a Teenager and a very big Pink Floyd fan, so that certainly helped. But it shows how much is lost now days because ""The Album"" concept is no more. There is no cohesive string of songs that compose the bands newest sound. It is one single after another. I understand why it happened, but it is a loss to newer bands and the current generations of younger people."

1798	Marium Khan	"*I don't think even Pink Floyd knew how far their influence and fan base spread in the 70's and 80's.* I mean I'm from Pakistan and my dad raised us with a combination of nasheeds and rock songs lol. I remember being 4 and nodding to his song as dad jammed to it while driving. I would ask him is Pink Floyd a person? And he would reply, ""No baita they are one of the best bands in the world. It's a group of people who sing songs."" I'm so grateful for that childhood haha. I remember screaming it in recess periods in 4th grade, ""Hey teachers! Leave the kids alone."" Parents were called for ""rebellious behaviour"" and my dad laughed his ass off until his face was red ... And bought me a mango ice cream on the way back home. So many memories associated with this band and this song. I just realized this got very long lol."

1891	Imperial Spy #7	Actually from the experience, I learned that school kills creativity because not everyone can be what they want to be, because we need people like construction workers, sewage pipes fixers, and other low paid hard working job in our world, and I know not a lot of people like that type of job, however without them the world will be in a bad state, and also not everybody can become a lawyer, businesses man, and an athlete

1912	Susanna Vaccaro	"É incredibile quanto conti l' insegnante per formarti o distruggerti . Per quanto mi riguarda,mi ritengo "" sufficentemente"" fortunata. Nella maggioranza dei casi e periodi,ho trovato appoggio e feeling. Solo in due casi,molto distanti nel tempo, due pessime esemplari,sadiche. Tipo questo "" perdente "" prof,che sfoga la sua nullità come individuo sui ragazzi. Che bello la rivincita! 😁Una,tremenda,proprio come nel video,ha mostrato i miei scarabocchi alla classe( che non l' ha appoggiata per fortuna) e solo perché non usavo scrivere in brutta copia prima. L' anno seguente,cambio scuola e residenza,si ripete tutto con una ex preside di poi insegnante di lettere, che mostra ,( a suo dire) un tema,per far vedere cos' era,una grafia matura. Ho mandato una pernacchia mentale,nell' aria ...all' altra,di matematica.Mh! Ovvia! * Questo brano dei Pink Floyd é indimenticabile , e molto significativo ,sú piú aspetti (ho visto anche il film,), L' abuso di potere,nonché ,la distruzione della passione ..e le conseguenze che né verranno fuori,tra i giovani commilitoni...tutti robotizzati.Agghiacciante!"

1971	djhvallejo	I remember playing this on the last day of school walking out on last period of middle school and the teacher yelling at me. I just turned it up louder. I was living in a small conservative town in CA that was mainly listening to country and western music. I was a military brat who had traveled all over the world and was only in the states maybe 3 years total so I listen to alot of different music. This was back in 1983. The other kids thought I was so bad ass. I didn't care. I was moving to a different country the next month anyway.,
1972	Devany Collis	the song is not against education itself but instead it's against how schools press the students by forcing them to work hard and harder just so they can get excellent marks and forcing them to study some useless subjects , instead of letting them study what they are really into , parents also play an important role in destroying the personality of their children by comparing them to their classmates or comparing them to their cousins who do better than their kids in school which causes depression and anxiety and even creating some suicidal thoughts ! but in fact getting good marks doesn't mean that a student is smarter than the other , it only means that one of them has a good memory than the other or that he or she are working day and night to arrive to this results , this is why I'm against exams because students only revise their lessons to pass THE EXAM and after few months they will forget everything they learnt , otherwise if students felt comfortable they will study to study not to pass the exam . I think that Scandinavian countries already arrived to this point and some European countries also , the educational system of Asian countries is also successful but have you ever observed that too many students commit suicide .... lol it's funny how am I criticizing those educational systems of developed countries while I'm living in a third world country because I gave up on criticizing our educational system , they will never change it because they don't want the population to realize how brainwashed we are .... my people are drowning in an ocean of ignorance , yes I blame the country but I also blame them for not using their brains ..I'm moroccan btw ... sorry if I wrote too much but I just have nobody to tell this to
