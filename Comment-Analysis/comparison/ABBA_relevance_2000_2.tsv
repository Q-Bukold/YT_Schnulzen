0	KEVIN CARLSON	"I was 17 when ""The Winner Takes It All"" was released, at the same time that I got my teenage heart broken. I think I wore out my cassette tape drowning in my melancholy. Years later my girlfriend and I reunited and we're happily married. I still love the song and appreciate the brilliance of ABBA now more than ever."	ABBA

12	Геннадий Лысенко	An amazing song. When I listen to her, it takes my breath away and emotions overwhelm me. I am grateful to God for giving humanity this wonderful group and the beautiful Agnetha with her divine voice. There are not enough words to describe all the admiration for this team. I am sure that ABBA will be in demand at all times, their music is eternal!	ABBA
13	Eben Hawthorne	Brings back good memories.She had insane vocal range,can't be copied,.80's were the best decade of all music .Never will come around again.	ABBA
14	jeh500	Possibly the best song about a breakup. ABBA will always be magic.	ABBA
18	Lanny Sousa	Nascir numa época posterior ao lançamento dessa música, mas ela consegue, inevitavelmente, me transportar para um tempo passado que não sei precisar, parece uma regressão de tão intensa a sensação que me causa.	ABBA
26	OJOK HERMINA	The most heart warming thing about ABBA is the courage to sing about a real life experience. I don't know how Agnetha could do it when her dream love life was falling apart, she could not know how that vulnerability was to impact so many and show them how to move on graciously after heart break. Abba the group just blessed us with their clear, clean version of ballads that any age group and any nationality could enjoy. They hit East Africa like a bombshell when we were in High School and at sixty we still rock to their golden oldies! May Yahweh bless them with His Light..,	ABBA

30	Vuk Stevovic	This song always makes me cry, because my parents divorced it was so stressful for me, my mother and my sister, but we continue to live and that is the magic of life.

37	Manning Bartlett	I was 12 when this song came out, and didn't really like it, that was the era of Duran Duran and Gary Numan for me. Then when I was 40 I heard it on the radio, and was absolutely blown away by what a total masterpiece it is - the lyrics, the songwriting, the overall production, and of course, Agnetha's singing. Sometimes you have to grow up in order to really understand something.	ABBA
38	Marika Damiano	Song that remains imprinted in the heart  and soul 	ABBA
39	Alexandr Věchtík	Best song from the Abba. I love this song forever.	ABBA

163	Anna	The winner takes it all Победитель получает все I don't wanna talkЯ не хочу говоритьAbout the things we've gone throughО том, что мы прошли.Though it's hurting meПусть это меня и ранит,Now it's historyНо это в прошлом.I've played all my cardsЯ сыграла все свои карты,And that's what you've done tooТы сыграл свои.Nothing more to sayНечего больше сказать.No more ace to playНет тузов для игры. The winner takes it allПобедитель получает все,The loser standing smallПроигравший остается с малым,Beside the victoryВ стороне от победы -That's her destinyЭто её судьба. I was in your armsЯ была в твоих руках,Thinking I belonged thereДумала, я принадлежу им,I figured it made senseПредставляла, что это имеет смысл.Building me a fenceСтроила себе ограду,Думала, что буду сильной в нем,But I was a foolНо я была глупа,Playing by the rulesИграя по правилам. The gods may throw a diceБоги могут кинуть кости -Their minds as cold as iceИх мысли холодны как лед -And someone way down hereА кто-то здесь внизуLoses someone dearПотеряет кого-то дорогого.The winner takes it allПобедитель получает все,The loser has to fallПроигравший должен упасть.It's simple and it's plainВсе просто и понятно,Why should I complain.На что мне жаловаться? But tell me does she kissНо скажи мне, разве она целуетLike I used to kiss you?Так, как я тебя целовала?Does it feel the sameЧувствуешь ли ты то же,When she calls your name?Когда она называет твое имяSomewhere deep insideГде-то в глубине душиYou must know I miss youТы должен знать - мне тебя не хватает,But what can I sayНо что я могу сказать -Rules must be obeyedНужно соблюдать правила. The judges will decideСудьи решат,The likes of me abideЧто такие, как я, должны смириться,Spectators of the showСторонние наблюдателиAlways staying lowВсегда отмалчиваются.The game is on againИ игра начинается по новой -A lover or a friendЛюбовник или друг?A big thing or a smallМного или мало?The winner takes it allПобедитель получает все. I don't wanna talkЯ не хочу говорить,If it makes you feel sadЕсли это тебя расстраивает,And I understandИ я понимаю -You've come to shake my handТы пришел пожать мою руку.I apologizeИзвини,If it makes you feel badЕсли ты расстраиваешься,Seeing me so tenseВидя меня такой напряженной,No self-confidenceТакой неуверенной...But you seeНо ты же видишь...The winner takes it allПобедитель получает все,The winner takes it all...Победитель получает все...

559	Kristen Lee	"I didn’t know this. But you can see it in her eyes. Nobody really knows the pent-up feelings behind the words of this song, ""Winner Takes All"", which this ABBA vocalist recorded with her resplendent soprano voice, endlessly dazzling millions of fans; but behind this moving song hid the melancholy and broken heart of Agnetha Fältskog for her separation from Björn Ulvaeus, whom she met shortly before forming the group ABBA, along with Benny Anderson and Anna Frida Lyngstad, who in turn also they had married; Agnetha felt deep in her heart the sadness of the breakup, and in her voice no one guessed that she was torn by her sentimental tragedy, and yet she had the character and poise to sing this moving song."

802	Loris Ferro	"Canzone fantastica,per me la più bella di tutti i tempi..Melodia superba grazie a Benny. Testo meraviglioso e per questo mi duole dirlo,bisogna ringraziare Bjorn. Agnetha fantastica, bellissima quando sorride, ancor di più quando è triste la frase: ""Ma dimmi, lei ti bacia come ti baciavo io"" è la più potente che sia mai stata scritta in una canzone d'amore.. Da pelle d'oca..Mi piace molto Agnetha alla fine quando dice: But you see: lì nel suo sguardo,si vede che ha la forza di rialzarsi ed andare avanti e ce l'ha fatta.Ora sono ritornati e le nuove canzoni per me sono una più bella dell'altra. E' bello vedere l'armonia, il rispetto e l'affetto reciproco e le belle parole dette durante le registrazioni. Per me sotto sotto c'è ancora l'amore nelle due coppie..Questa bellissima canzone degli Abba che preferisco. Una voce celestiale è un testo sempre attuale.Direi fantastica..Queste bellissime canzoni che riescono ancora ad emozionarti dopo tanti anni sono le vere canzoni,""perché sono immortali.Complimenti per questo bellissimo video degli Abba skv90s..."

1515	Woofers against Violence	"To think that Bjorn was married to her and wrote this while he was playing up behind her back. He seems the most unattractive of the four, maybe insecure. Can't see that he was the winner or that he takes it all. Judging by all these comments so many years later. I think most of us, well guys anyway think he freakin blew it!! Lost an Angel.. BTW, who else notices @ 2min 59 secs when Agnetha sings ""spectators of the show, always staying low"" as she half turns to her friend Frida and gently half waves back towards her; as she sings these poignant sad few words live on stage. Wow, the world is still in love with her poise and beauty."	ABBA

1608	Omar Sighinolfi	"Fantastic song, the most beautiful ever !! Agnetha fantastic, beautiful when she smiles, even more so when she is sad (but I wish she had never been sad!) The phrase: "" But tell me does she kiss like i used to kiss you "" is the most powerful that has ever been written in a song! Goose bumps. I really like Agnetha at the end when she says: ""But you see"": there you can see that she has the strength to get up and go on and she made it!"	ABBA

1630	japan biking	I don't wanna talk about the things we've gone through Though it's hurting me, now it's history I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too Nothing more to say, no more ace to play The winner takes it all, the loser standing small Beside the victory that's her destiny I was in your arms thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense building me a fence Building me a home thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool playing by the rules The Gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here loses someone dear The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain But tell me does she kiss like I used to kiss you Does it feel the same, when she calls your name Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you But what can I say rules must be obeyed The judges will decide, the likes of me abide Spectators of the show always staying low The game is on again, a lover or a friend A big thing or a small the winner takes it all I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad And I understand you've come to shake my hand I apologize if it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence But you see the winner takes it all The winner takes it all So the winner takes it all and the loser has to fall Throw a dice, cold as ice Way down here, someone dear Takes it all, has to fall Yes it's plain, no complain	ABBA

1640	Paperboy	Always loved this song but never knew until a recent interview with Agnetha that she co-wrote it during her divorce as well as the group splitting up. She said it remains her favorite, sad though it was, because she knew she was about to experience a certain freedom from all the traveling & lack of privacy & enjoy being a mother. As they say all good things must come to an end. Agnetha seems happy now but would prefer to enjoy her life today rather than remember what once was or be included in any reunion or fanfare. And to that I say, “be well & thank you for the music!”	ABBA
1642	Anthony Amburn	An old song I kind of ignored back in the day. Now listening to it and seeing Agnetha sing it, her pain is palpable.	ABBA
